Between two people we ordered the fat cheeks tray ($26) with pulled chicken, sliced brisket, and pork ribs. We paid a little extra ($1 or so) to substitute the cold scoop for a hot scoop, and got the mac and cheese and the BBQ beans. We also got the bucket of biscuits ($14) which came with four huge biscuits and a super tasty honey butter.They have house-made sauces at each table which go great with the food. They have a BBQ sauce, a vinegar, and a very spicy habanero sauce. I loved combining the BBQ sauce with the habanero.The biscuits were incredible! Super buttery and flaky, and they went well with everything. They can also be ordered individually at $4 a biscuit but I don't know if it comes with the honey butter.The BBQ beans had an awesome flavor and the texture was good. Not too soft but still cooked thoroughly.The mac and cheese was my favorite! It came with a super crispy and fragrant topping that pulled everything together. Even if it didn't have the crispy topping, the sauce was very cheesy and creamy.I felt that the pulled chicken was a bit too salty and was a little dry. The meat on the ribs fell beautifully off of the bone, but was on the plainer side so I dipped it in a lot of sauce. The brisket was tender and juicy-- definitely my favorite out of the three.The fat cheeks tray and bucket of biscuits ended up being way too much food for the two of us! We were stuffed and took the leftovers to go.I am still interested in giving their other meats a chance, but I will be coming back for their lunch menu where you can get a tray of their sides!> Meh? The food looks great, but fell VERY short on flavor. Even the sauces on the table were not exciting. Seriously disappointed, particularly given the price we paid. Potato salad - it was German potato salad. I hate German potato salad. Wish the menu mentioned i wouldn't be getting standard potato salad so I wouldn't waste my money. Pickles -  basically no flavor. Crunchy, but definitely not pickles, more like slightly vinegary veggies. Biscuits - good, but a fairly standard biscuit. The honey buttery was nice, but still made for just a good biscuit. Guess it says something that this is the menu item they're known for. I mean, you're a BBQ joint and you're known for biscuits? Meats - we tried sausage (bland) and both kinds of brisket (fatty). Tried adding table sauces to help with the flavor and they didn't really help. Mac and cheese- probably our favorite part of the meal. Cute presentation in a fun metal mug.I don't think it's worth your time or money. Try BBQ elsewhere.> Came here without a reservation on a Friday night. The hostess was super rude and didn't even seem to care nor acknowledge our presence. Furthermore, when we inquired about the wait, she seemed super annoyed for some reason. There were multiple open tables and seats by the bar and she kept saying it was only for reservations even though there were tons of open seats. Regardless, the food and waitress made me forget this horrid experience with the hostess behind the tablet.Ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the biscuits. The biscuits were SO YUMMY. They are very big, fluffy, buttery, ginormous, and just melt in your mouth. I always cut it in half and slobber it with butter as its just so big. Biscuits are a must-get here as you probably already know.The buttermilk fried chicken comes with a cold side and a hot side. I got cole slaw and mac and cheese. Cole slaw was fine, mac and cheese was good and comes in a mug. The fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've had in any restaurant (may change once I visit the South). The skin is super crispy and deep-fried perfectly. The chicken is juicy and cooked perfectly.Also, the hostess was super friendly and attentive. Thank god.Will come again as this is probably the best Southern food in Boston. Make reservations too!> DINNER REVIEWI THINK I DIED AND WENT TO FRIED CHICKEN AND BISCUITS HEAVEN.After moving to Boston from the South where I was used to biscuits, BBQ, and fried chicken galore, I had been searching for a place to have really good southern food. I think (nay, I know) I've found it at Sweet Cheeks. If you don't know Tiffani Faison, she's a Top Chef finalist who owns several restaurants in the Fenway area (Tiger Mama is another one of my favorites of hers). Sweet Cheeks was her first restaurant and boy am I glad I finally went.The place has a really lively, fun atmosphere with cool decor, TVs playing, and a picture of a nearly naked Burt Reynolds in the men's bathroom. It's a great place to go have a fun dinner with friends.And I haven't even gotten to the food!My friends and I started off with the Bucket O' Biscuits which come with 4 HUGE biscuits and some delicious honey butter to spread on them. They are crispy on the outside and warm and buttery on the inside. Some of the best I've ever had. One is enough for each person, especially if you are going to get one of the platters.Then I ordered the Fried Chicken because I had heard such good things about it and WOW! Just look at that picture. That is a full half chicken (and BIG pieces of half chicken) fried perfectly crispy but moist in the middle. I got it with a hot shake (spicy seasoning) and got jalapeno ranch on the side to take it up a notch. I will be back solely for the chicken. But the sides (or as they call them, scoops) are delicious as well. I would have eaten buckets of that mac n cheese and the coleslaw provided a nice acidic contrast to the very heavy and hearty chicken and mac n cheese. That's also why they give you pickles and onions.For the price, the portion sizes are HUGE! I can't wait to come back and try their BBQ too.> I came with a friend on a weekday evening. The restaurant was very empty, so we were quickly seated. We ordered a bucket of biscuits to share, and I ordered a prime beef brisket sandwich for myself. The biscuits were so flaky and light! The honey butter was AMAZING! It was so sweet and delicious that I couldn't get enough! The prime beef brisket sandwich was quite delicious. There was a good portion of fatty beef on the sandwich, which I was very happy about! The flavor was really delicious and smoky. Overall, I was very pleased with our dinner. I do think that $14 is pretty steep for 4 biscuits and a small cup of honey butter, but it tasted really good.","4, 3, 4, 5, 4"

The food was absolutely devine! My friend's plate came out first and while we were waiting for mine, I thought I was going to start drooling just from looking at it. The smell was heavenly and the taste was superb! I also liked that the menu has unique combinations, for example pork belly with nectarines, pesto and Gorgonzola. It sounds weird,  but it was amazing (and probably the only 6000 calories per plate that are really worth sweating it at the gym).You should make reservations, we didn't make any and the wait was ~40 minutes. We were lucky to spot 2 seats at the bar, made the order and it came out very quickly.Will definitely come back for more!> For sure they are welcoming to the older crowd, saw it first hand, so if you are over 60, prolly avoid the joint. The bar is an amazing place, sizable, dark, and richly appointed but not in a ""club"" manner, more like New Orleans meets Vietnam meets France kind of thing.The host desk, which is separated from the  bar and the dining room (I think to try to screen people a bit) was blaring some uninteresting ""lil"" choose your favorite gangster wanna-be-hip-hop idiot.  That was remarkable, actually as usually these places are a bit more PC.But whatevs, the food here trumps it all.  It was super good, from the pita, to the octopus, we tried quite a bit, and all super good.My pro-tip is to come here with a bunch of high energy people and just let it hang out, Order a bunch of stuff, drink like a fish, and then just to cap off the orgy of indulgence, order the giant $45 baked alaska, Memories made...> Amazing food.Service/Managerial concern? Leaves much to be desired.  Had a delicious meal there with a friend last week. Table next to us spilled their red wine ALL OVER me and my shit, my freshly dry-cleaned winter jacket, my work backpack, ass of my jeans. Not only was the spiller not mortified/offer to buy us a round/offer dry cleaning, our server handed me 2 kitchen rags to clean up the mess. Um, WHAT? I'm in charge of clean up for the table next to us who just spilled red wine all over me and my shit in the middle of dinner? What's even worse is that I have yet to receive a response to the non-aggressive email I sent the day after providing feedback and asking Yvonne's for help.When there are so many excellent restaurants in Boston, you may as well go somewhere that gives a shit about their customers.> Wow! From the street i wasn't sure what to expect. But once inside this place is massive and has so much character. It's a very posh speakeasy with their own take on classic cocktails. I had the Churn and Burn (think bourbon Old Fashion) it was great. The gin and tonic looked very colorful and yummy too. We had some small plates that were quite tasty.> I come here at least twice a month!!! Reservations are a must if you're coming here Friday -Sunday. Perfect for two people or big groups! Came here for the first time for my birthday and been coming back ever since because the drinks here are quality and food is shareable (tapas).There are small appetizers, pita breads, and also larger plate appetizers! There are also set large meals for bigger parties, which include a lot of food (so you need to have a large party for that) Favs: hummus, pork belly pita, fried shrimpDrinks: they have a wide variety of wines and cocktails. I love their special gin and tonic. This place is def on the pricier side, especially the small tapas!! At times, the servers can be a little bit rude depending on the day, not sure why some people are not very friendly. I think for some reason, they're nicer if you are a regular or have been there before.","5, 4, 2, 5, 4"
Tasty Pot,Boston,4.0,2,No,Null,Yes,tastypotusa.com,"Hot Pot, Bubble Tea, Taiwanese",11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 10:45 pm,11:00 am - 10:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,Null,Null,"Really good! I went here as part of a Yelp Elite event. I loved the set-up that they had. I decided to get the lamb hot soup, which came out in a heated bowl, so the soup stayed warm. They had a few sauces that I could add to the soup. I loved that the soup came with so many different components in it, so I could try a variety of things and never get sick of anything. One of my favorite things in the soup was the tofu. I also got a bubble tea, which was really good! They had a lot of variety, but I would definitely recommend also getting one. I would definitely go back, and I'd love to try some of the different soups.> Awesome take on hot pot! I ordered the Beef Hot Soup, and my boyfriend had the Curry Hot Soup. You specify the spice level and then you choose either vermicelli noodles or rice to come on the side. Just note, it's an actual side of rice and not rice noodles as I originally thought (oops!).  Everything is already cooked when it comes out to you, which I love versus traditional hot pot because I usually am too impatient to wait to cook my food. I also just like how it's so easy to choose what bowl you want instead of having to pick the toppings on your own, which can be tricky if you don't get the right combination. Unlike a couple of other reviews, I didn't have a problem with how much cabbage was in mine. I thought it was just the right amount in addition to so many other toppings! I loved the variety - fish balls, crab meats, taro, fried tofu skin, etc. They definitely did not skimp. I thought the portion size was perfect and left me feeling fully satisfied. For dessert, we ordered some of their drinks. I had the Milk Creme Black Tea and my boyfriend ordered the Rose Matcha Latte with Boba. I was completely obsessed with the milk cap - it was slightly salty but sweet at the same time and creamy, which paired amazingly with the black tea which isn't as sweet. It was the perfect combination!Also, make sure to take advantage of their virtual wait list - makes everything so much easier. I will definitely be back.> I'm so happy this is here. Used to go to the one in Union City, CA. Everything tastes the same! The only difference was they don't have the membership award system (buy 10 get 1 free) and you had to pay for sha Cha sauce and Szechuan sauce $1/ea (was free in CA)But unlimited broth... winner. They use the beef broth to add no matter what soup you use (I think) so grab that sha Cha sauce, order chopped fresh garlic, green onions and use it as your dip for your meat and soup... sides vary from $1.75 (rice) , $3.50/$4.50 (enoki mushroom, dumplings, fried tofu, etc...) to $5.50 (beef, lamb, stinky tofu) just got into Roe fish balls (drool)Don't forget to get their black tea cream boba drink. Good balance of sweetness and creaminess.A must try. Service is fast, friendly and delightful.Been here 4x already!!!! Always hits the (Tasty) sPOT!> I've been on the hunt for something similar to Boiling Point from Los Angeles in Boston - Tasty Pot does not meet my expectations. The menu is quite extensive, offering about 12 or more soups. I found that each soup came with a lot of cabbage compared to anything else. Tasty Pot has a waitlist available on Yelp which allows customers to join the waitlist prior to arriving.> Really liked this place!The servings are HUGE definitely could be shared by 2 or people and they have milk tea. I got the taro tea and the seafood supreme and it was so amazing and my partner got the beef one and the beef was so flavorful. I love the dishes the food comes in they're like your own hot pot plates. Definitely would come back!","4, 5, 5, 2, 4"

The ambiance is mellow. They sometimes play hipster house music. Service can be hit or miss. Right in china town. Clean establishment. Parking really sucks to find.Lunch time before 3pm on weekdays is the business. The  jumbo or ""more"" portioned combo cost $22 instead of the dinner $32. Tom yum broth is very flavorful. Has that lemon grass spice, chili zing, and the sour. Miso is a good pair with it for the subtle not too strong flavor. I always get jumbo. The meat quality here is soo much better than other places. From the marbling to the cut, it's a nice treat. Melt in the mouth meat. Add ramen for extra $2. I highly recommend this spot . I'll come here every time. Not sure but the garlic chili flavor has changed. It doesn't taste garlic-y any more . Only difference from 4 years ago. Prices have been the same since 4 years ago. One of the many spots I love to come to.> I used to loveeeeeee Shabu-Zen. The food was great and the food is still really great. However, the boss don't take care of his customers. He's more about saving himself a couple of dollars from each customer. The food are already on the pricer side to begin with. It started with him taking away the free sweet bean soup at the end of the meal. Then took one piece of meat away from the boneless rib plate. They use to put 16 pieces on the plate and now it's only 15. He ordered his waiting staff to fluff the rice to make it look fuller. Also, now he don't offer bbq sauce or chopped chili from the start. It's only available upon requests. I don't think I will be coming back. I will take my business elsewhere. The boss don't value his customers, then I don't need to value his restaurant.> Good but standard hot pot.  Best part is the selection of broth options (Spicy Szechuan is my favorite).  Broth is $5 unless you get the complimentary house broth. Went for dinner and got the A5 prime beef ($16 for regular) which comes with some veggies (e.g., Bok choy, Napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, etc) and your choice of noodles (udon vs vermicelli) or rice. Service is friendly and fast.  Hot pot is served individually so easy to go with friends and each person can choose their own broth (great for those who have varying spice tolerances).  There are several hot pot choices in Chinatown and this is a good option, but certainly not a ""must go to"" spot.> Despite my family and I being regulars at this restaurant, I've never wrote a review here and I thought that it was time. We have a waiter that ended up coincidentally being our regular waiter every time we visited. My dad loves him and he's not a very easy person to please. Think stern hard-to-please asian dad. Our waiter would always bring out chopped red peppers (something they used to bring out when they first opened but don't anymore) and extra stuff to put in our sauce without asking. He'd come and greet us in Vietnamese, ask where my mom was whenever she doesn't come out to eat with me and my brother. It honestly always a please trip to Shabu-zen just because of our waiter (and food of course!!). We just oddly never gotten his name, but will update this review when I find out!Anyway!!! On to the food review part! Broth is always good! My family usually does half spicy Mongolian and half Chinese herbal. The broth is the reason why we don't go to the Allston location much. It's slightly different. Things we always get:A2. Prime Grade Boneless Short Rib (Jumbo)A11. Surf and Turf (My mom likes the seafoodFish Paste*** (personal FAV)Sauteed Baby ClamsSauteed Beef TongueRaw Beef TongueRice (it hits different here, trust)> Pros: The food is just simply bomb. My favorite broth to get is the Tom Yum and Kim-Chee because some places like Hot Pot Buffet or Spring-Shabu doesn't offer Tom Yum which is my favorite! Their prime rib eye/beef or prime grade short ribs will always be the best meats and it's great that each meat plate comes with a side of noodles/rice and veggies. I also recommend their sautéed beef tongue (my all time favorite place to eat sautéed beef tongue is Shabu-zen), and stuffed meatballs (don't knock it till you try it!). They also have their special soy sauce and it's fun mixing in the garlic, pepper, scallion, and bbq sauce to dip the food in!Service: The team of servers at Shabu-Zen have always been great and attentive. It's like they always knew when we needed something. Cons: The only con I have is that it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order or how many people the party is composed of. But it's worth every penny and to be expected because of the great quality. Also because it's located in Chinatown it's best to go in the evening where there are more parking spots and no need to pay for meters. Overall: Shabu-Zen has always been on my top list for hotpot spots in Boston. Every single time I've gone I was not disappointed by the food or the service.","5, 5, 2, 3, 5"
PABU Boston,Boston,4.0,3,Yes,Null,Yes,pabuizakaya.com,"Sushi Bars, Izakaya, Venues & Event Spaces",12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,Closed,Null,Null,"PABU has proven to me that it not only deserves to be in the conversation with the best sushi restaurants in Boston, but as one of the premier dining experiences in the city.I actually got the idea for dining at PABU from a Travelzoo voucher that I got for my wife and myself on a whim. I had not heard of it prior to and after I got the voucher started researching the chef, location, and what dishes they were best known for. The menu is diverse and offers a lot of interesting dishes that can be easily split among a few or numerous people. There is also a very interesting menu of sushi that is exclusively imported from Japan (and immediate surrounding waters), giving diners the opportunity to enjoy the fares of the Japan without actually visiting. The sushi menu and small plates were where we settled on for our meal, having a more tasting-style approach to our dinner than getting bigger plates and only getting to try a few things. Oddly enough, the Tokyo Fried chicken was one of my least favorite dishes and I still REALLY liked it. There was nothing we had that wasn't perfectly prepared and presented to us at the chef's table (end of the sushi bar). Highlights of the meal were definitely the house-made tofu, maitake mushroom tempura, and the sashimi selections we made from the Japanese fish menu. From a price perspective, PABU is more than reasonable. Where some multi-course sushi experiences will run $150/person without drinks I think our total bill was under $200, including two drinks for each of us as well as tax and tip. The service and attention we got was exactly on par with what we expected. We were given the perfect amount of attention without feeling constantly interrupted or ignored, which I think they appreciated hearing when asked how our experience was outside of the food. PABU can easily fall into the special occasion kind of meal, but you can also be choosy and have a great meal for a more than reasonable tab. I think this will be added to the rotation for sushi as well as special occasion destinations going forward. They've proven to be a powerhouse in an already crowded sector and were able to wow the wife and I during our first visit.> Had high expectations for this restaurant but was far from impressed. We had a 7:30 reservation and waited 15 minutes to be seated, though there were at least a dozen open tables at the time we arrived. Nigiri was the skimpiest portion I have ever seen. We ordered the wagyu flank medium rare and it took one hour and fifteen minutes to come out. We asked the waiter what the hold us was and he said ""it takes 30 min to cook so it was really only 15 minutes late."" Good math!!?? When giving us the bill he ""sorry I know it's always feels like you're waiting forever when you're hungry! Next time you come back we can do a round of drinks on the house."" Definitely won't be returning because the food is mediocre at best, the comments were unwarranted, and there is a lack of care regarding customer experience. Waste of $300> you MUST try the homemade tofu here!! It's one of my favorite dishes! And over to my review... I came here to celebrate an anniversary - everything about staff to the food was all amazing. Our waiter was so sweet, made us some great recommendations and we had such a wonderful time here. We tried dishes from every category of the menu such as hot dishes, sushi, cold appetizers etc. I wanted to try everything. I can't wait to come back next time to order the tofu again, but also other delicious dishes! This is definitely a great spot for a date because it's located in downtown crossing and the environment is so chic. If you have larger parties, definitely book ahead in advance because usually the tables are organized for 2 to 4 people.> I came here for a date night based on Yelp reviews and you guys did not let me down! First of all, the decor is absolutely beautiful. The lighting is dark and romantic. The Happy Spoon is a must when you're here. We enjoyed all of the sushi and dumplings. Drinks were great as well. My only critique is that portions can be larger. I def want to try their Omakase next time - the couple next to our table had it and we were so impressed. We'll be back soon!> We decided to come back and experience Pabu outside of Restaurant Week. Two words: customer service!! The managers here are the best in the Boston restaurant scene. Not only are they on the ground running & present, their attention to detail to guests is admirable. You can tell that their love/passion for the restaurant goes beyond just the day to day operations, it's about building customer relationships and providing exceptional experience. They definitely made me a loyal customer. From the start, our host asked to take our coats and we were greeted by our waiter shortly. With every meal presentation, the waiter makes sure to describe the dish and comes to check on us quite regularly. As for the food, I cannot be happier. We ventured out and tried these:Local Oysters: 4/5 I mean, you can't really go wrong with oysters. I think we might have squeezed too much of the lemon so it was just a bit too sour and overwhelmed the actual oyster's taste. Delicious either way.Ikayaki Grilled Squid: 3.5/5 I would've really liked this if there were less burnt pieces. The middle section was better as you could really taste the squid but get the crispy grilled parts as well.Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: 5/5!! Musttttt get this. This is my favorite dish on the menu so far. The foie gras was seared so perfectly - sweet, distinct, fatty. The eel was paired absolutely beautiful with the crispy rice. This is one of those dishes that I'm going to crave for a long time.Milk Chocolate-Sesame Custard: 5/5 yumm. Everything about this I loved. If you like milk chocolate, sesame, and red bean, go for it. Great dish to share as well because you get a whole bowl's worth.Mochi Sundae: 3/5 not a fan of shaved ice usually so this didn't quite impress me. The tapioca and mochi flavors weren't quite there either. Overall, I'm definitely coming back again - happy hour I heard is the way to go","5, 2, 5, 4, 5"

What a gem this place is.  The location is perfect.  Cobblestones on the road will guide you to this old house turned to restaurant.  There are 4-5 rooms which hosts a small number of people, making it feel very cozy.   The food was super delicious and the wine spectacular.   They have an immense list of Italian wines.  I went there to celebrate a birthday and the staff (Rafael) was able to accommodate a surprise dessert with candle and everything.   There is valet parking ($27) which is perfect to avoid the hassle of finding parking in the North End.> Came here for a dinner with my family. We got the smelts, lobster pasta, steak, and ossobucco. The smelts were not my cup of tea (could have just been me). We had a rather exuberant waiter who spent the majority of our dinner at our table, which is absolutely not my cup of tea (he messed up a good amount of our orders as well). The food was very expensive and really not worth it. The steak I got was small and just okay. The best part of it was the foie gras and it was only one bite. The location however was great and the little, romantic room was very cute!We skipped out on dessert at the restaurant and went down the street to Bova's (HIGHLY recommend). Not sure if it was an off night but can't say I'll be back anytime soon with all of the amazing options in the North End.> Very good, if slightly pricey experience, this evening at Mamma Maria which is located in Boston's North End but slightly off the regular beaten track of Hanover Street.I booked on Open Table and we were immediately seated when we arrived on time. A nice two-top table upstairs (I think this is a converted home) not far from the bar.Great service starting with a hearty bread that looked delicious and I skipped as it's not on my eating regime. Burrata as appetizer was a smaller portion but looking delicious and tasting better.Mamma Maria does not have a ""specials"" list because everything on the menu is prepared from that day's purchases. So I decided on the ""Bistecca alla Fiorentina"" which was a good sized steak (I opted for not the bone-in), grilled to medium rare and served with eggplant, sea beans and spring vegetables. When it arrived, it was cooked exactly right and I dug in to a delicious large cut of meat that needed nothing additional. Flavorful and firm. Yum.No dessert for me, but I did bring my dining companion over to Mike's for a canoli.[Review 10801 overall, 569 of 2019.]> Lovely, cute, cozy (even crowded) North End Italian restaurant.  Definitely recommended for folks touring in Boston and want to experience the North End Italian scene.  Book early as it fills up fast.  We had a great waiter.  The food varied from amazing (an off-menu pasta with truffles that we noticed our neighbors eating) to very good (the carpaccio) to could have been better (the veal milanese was really brown or crunchy and the meat was kind fatty -- never I ate it and it was good; just not what I'd hoped for.)  My advice:  go here, and ask the waiter what to order as it seems a bit more variable than most.","5, 5, 2, 4, 4"

Nestled in the South End in between B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop is an innovative and fun way to experience fine dining. Pre-paid reservations are made easily online and include tax + gratuity. You select the theme that you would like to experience. They offer hands on classes or cooking demonstrations where the only thing you need to lift is your fork and wine glass. Of course we chose the latter. The whole experience was interactive and delicious. We asked the chef a bunch of questions which he happily answered. Every wine pairing was fantastic and complimented the flavors of the dish! I would definitely recommend this for date night or for an intimate group dinner.> The kitchen space can seat maximum of 10 people and thus creates a intimate feel. The food is cooked in front of you - it was really cool to watch the pasta being made live. Food was great and we were given short explanations on the wine pairings throughout. Maybe it was because the food is so fresh - but one of us had a bug crawl in the food...Overall really great experience - taste is superb and as expected of a place of this caliber and pricing. Just nothing memorable that'll make me want to run back here over the many other high end places.> Foodies take note, this is the ultimate 5 star experience.  I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift and a gift to my taste buds it was!  Unlike regular cooking classes, this is more akin to having your very own gourmet chefs and sommelier hosting a very intimate dinner for a table of 10 (see pics and video).   Each night debuts a different culinary adventure and on ours, we got to partake on their wonderful Shellfish & Citrus spread. Every course was meticulously created with all the freshest, highest quality ingredients and the chefs would explain how each were prepared and share tips on how to cook it perfectly from scratch.  Some dishes like the raw oyster with the sweet mignonette sauce, scallop ceviche and crab salad were made more delicately to preserve that fresh seafood taste while others like the fried clams, shrimp romesco and tuna dishes showcased a more bolder taste with Asian and Mediterranean flavors which paired beautifully with their mild red wines.   Everything tasted divine.  And the staff?  So friendly!  It was like having a couple of really good friends hosting and cooking up a storm at their house.  We couldn't have asked for a better night out.  Absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something just a little more out of the box.  It's a bit pricey but you won't regret it!> Stir provides an intimate private dining experience for up to 9 people, set in their kitchen with bookshelves full of cookbooks and a single bathroom. The chef and wine sommelier are the only staff present throughout your meal, explaining each course and wine pairing to every detail. The location is set directly next to the Butcher Shop and across the street from B&G Oysters, completing the ultimate Barbara Lynch triad in the South End.RESERVATIONS:Look up their class schedule online and e-mail reservations@stirboston.… to reserve a class. The classes fill up so quickly that I ended up signing up for waitlist spots and got multiple openings last-minute. I would suggest looking into classes a month in advance! Before coming in, I thought it would be an interactive cooking class where we would help prepare the meal, but in reality the chef just cooks in front of you and shares techniques from a specific cookbook. They will lay out some of the prep work required, and share tips on how to cook the course. Our wine sommelier shared each wine's origin, flavor profile, and ideal food pairings. In total, we had 5 courses with 5 different wines from Michael Psilakis' ""How to Roast a Lamb: New Greek Classic Cooking."" At the end of the meal, we received this cookbook! We can now attempt to duplicate this amazing experience at home. This was the most unique dining experience to date, and my boyfriend and I agree that Stir tops Barbara Lynch's restaurants.> Wonderful experience, fantastic host, a convivial atmosphere that is more dinner party then fine dinning. The food and wine pairings were spot on. I would love to have learned more about the book and authors to connected to the meal. Great experience. Can't wait to go back!","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The pizza was good and they were not shy with the toppings. The sauce had a good flavor but was not enough.Please add more sauce !> Service was really great. But... we didn't find the pizza itself good at all. Everything kinda left a bad taste in our mouths.  Like, a lingering oily feel and taste.  You cant really go wrong w cheese or pepperoni, usually...  we thought those would be safe.  And then I decided to be adventurous by trying the potato skin & bbq chicken.  Bad idea.But at least now we know. ‍> Awesome pizza which says A lot because I'm a NY native and I am loyal to nyc pizza. James was great as my sister and I are visiting Boston and he gave us some great info about the area! Pizza was delicious and fresh and affordable.> So I ordered the vegan jerk pizza on Postmates and I am in awe, I literally called to double check it was vegan. Legit so freakin good, I'm so glad that I know about this place. The crust was amazing and the almond based sauce is soo freaking good. I have always been wary of trying jack fruit but holy moly that's yummy, and had a good kick! Plus there is mango on top which I thought was an interesting choice but I'm obsessed!

I ordered a half sized appetizer - stuffed eggplant and a half order of the lobster ravioli. I honestly have no idea how I would have finished a full size of these dishes. I saw other people's pasta dishes and I swear they got served a bucket of pasta. If I lived in Boston I'd order the full sized dishes and then feed myself for at least two more meals. If you're visiting you may just want to ask for half size. I'd like to add that the service was great too. I was in a huge rush (realllllllly pushing the limit on getting to the airport on time) and they accommodated me accordingly. I'd definitely come back.> Finally tried the famous Rino's after hearing about it for years and listening to my friend describe the massive portions.On his suggestion, we ordered a dish that he couldn't remember the name of and I can't remember the name of. It was basically a fettucine dish with cream sauce, chicken, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes (which my friend raved about), and mushrooms. True to his proclamation, the plate was huge and it was good that we split it because we still had plenty to take home with us. The garden salad and bread were so so. Admittedly, I would have expected better for the bread but you don't come here (or wait) for the bread. By the way, we were told it would probably be a ten minute wait on Friday night around 8 pm so we stopped by Kelly's pub for a drink. While we were eating, we saw others waiting for probably an hour. That said, apparently, you can make a reservation ahead of time. We also shared an appetizer beforehand. I think it was the caprese which we probably should have finished before leaving. The tiramisu dessert was wonderful. As my friend described it, it was light, which is perfect for a heavy, rich dinner. We easily finished that and being a dessert lover, I wish it was as large as dinner.> Great Authentic Italian restaurant.  So worth the wait. Called ahead and waited for them to call us to let us know table was available. Hung out at Kellys Square Pub (Fantastic Pub) until our time. Every thing we ordered in our party of 9 was dynamite. The Lobster Ravioli that we were  told was out of this world was just that... the Frutti De Mare in white sauce and red sauce....knocked outta the park. Al The apps... we had Calamari, Stuffed Eggplant, Mozerrella balls/sticks all made to perfection. All the homemade pasta insanely great....gnocchi, pappardelle, penne....all was phenomenal.  You want great Italian food without having to go to the North End....this is your stop. Service was out of this world also. And on top of all this the price was right. With what they are kicking out of that kitchen you would expect to pay those insane North End prices but not here. This is top notch and we cant wait to come back. A++++#BuddhaReview> This place is soooooo good!! Italian food just like in the North End. The lobster ravioli is the best we've had in Boston (and we have had a lot of different places' lobster ravioli!). Generally a line to get in so plan accordingly...or get take out!

I have never once had any problems with this place (I can't say the same for The Capital Grille in Chestnut Hill which always over cooked my steaks). Anyways, I once deviated from my normal order and got the wagyu which was cooked and tasted beautifully. I 100% recommend getting the creamed corn, lobster macaroni & cheese or any of their potatoes as a side dish. For red wine, I recommend pairing your steak with the 2017 Orin Swift Machete. Otherwise, they have an extensive wine collection, so you will always find something great to pair with your meal. Their cheesecake dessert is also very tasty. The atmosphere here is perfect for a steakhouse with fantastic panoramic views. All of the seating is comfortable, both at the bar and dinner tables. The servers are very knowledge and attentive. This location's manager is also very kind and accommodating. I used to see him often at the Capital Grille. He made his transition over to Del Frisco's as a manager just as I did as a diner.> Myself and some co workers went to the seaport Del Frisco's for a retirement party in early February. We booked a private room for the 15 or so of us, which was a $2000.09 mOne of us was looking at the wine list and asked if there was a solemner working who could help to order. The woman sold him on a ""magnum"" which would be about 2 glasses per guest. No mention was made of the price point or what we were looking to spend on a glass of wine with dinner. When they began pouring he asked and found that the bottle was $2750.00. I feel as though this was underhanded, unethical and the last thing I would expect from a first-class establishment (which is what Del Frisco's portrays itself to be). Further, 2 of my friends had to send their steaks back due to being over-cooked. Needless to say I will not be back nor will I recommend the restaurant ti anyone looking for a steakhouse when in Boston. Spoke with Emily who told me someone from the actual restaurant would be contacting me. Has not happened...Still waiting to hear from restaurant. Lol Good stuff> Valentines Day FAIL!  For Valentines Day you would expect a romantic quiet ambiance. Here you get a head thumping club noise level experience. We asked for the music to be turned down several times but nothing happened. They put make shift tables up and had the chairs situated so when you went to sit down you smashed your knee into the huge table leg.  I still have a bruise on my knee a week later! The staff was nice. The drinks were good, but took forever to arrive. The filet medallions were good but it was a small portion.I think the ""age steaks"" are false marketing.  As they didn't have the flavor or texture you get from a dry aged steak. Also, they make you cut into the middle of the steak to check it's cooked right when it first arrives.  Shouldn't a steak house have better confidence in there cooking?  I also don't like starting my steak in the middle. The potatoes were way over seasoned with pepper. The Brussels sprouts were yummy. Since the dry aged steak seemed to have been misrepresented, and the ambiance was terrible, I would say the food was way over priced> I'd love to give 5 stars and if this review were solely on the food, it would be 5 stars.I've been in several times and spent $1000. + on meals. Food always good!Here's the bad: I've always had a reservation and I've always been offered very poor table locations. One of the reasons the place is great is the views.Once again on the day after Valentines Day (a Saturday) we arrived at our reserved time and were escorted to a table in a room that is a function room converted to regular table space for the expected crowd. We went into the room of 25 or so tables. Nobody else in there and I said this is unacceptable. I'd like a table on the main floor which had many many open tables. The hostess stated that our room would fill up very quickly and not to worry. I didn't care about the occupancy of the room, i wanted views and ambience the main dining room offered and had a ton of tables in. She stated that all of the tables were slotted and mapped out in advance and no changes could be made. Total BS. Our waiter arrived and apologized and also stated he didn't like working the room either but we'd have to stay. Service was good and we moved on and he was a very good waiter. I did tell him and several others that every time I come in I get a lousy table, spend a lot of money and don't think I'll return. Again, apologies abound and  during our meal, only 3 more tables filled the room of around 25 total tables. When we finished our meal and began our exit through the place, there were still many tables on the main floor open. I would think a manager would have paid my table a visit and apologized, offered another table, anything but couldn't be bothered.During the meal, the lights were lowered in this room and the lights simply flickered constantly. Staff couldn't fix it and apologized. A Fairly high end steak house should be better than this! They weren't and doubt I'll return.A shame because the food and service are quite good but spending a couple hundred dollars on a meal for 2 should include a table and location worth the expense.Management wasn't busy and really could've shown up. They didn't and that's unprofessional in this and any other business.> Top notch dining experience.View of the Boston Harbour, fresh air, fresh seafood,awesome service and great ambiance Didn't dine on one of their much ballyhooedSteaks, opted instead for Shellfish Plateau It's actually designed for 2 people but themanager said they could build it for just oneperson, fantastic!!! Not everyone goes to awell known Steakhouse to order seafood.The Plateau has King Crab legs, LobsterTail, Crab Claws and shrimp. I added Raw Oysters to the Plateau and had a side of Asparagus Spears. All of it was fresh and delicious! Washed it down with beer namedVIP and also some Lagunitas IPA. Enjoyedour waitress Caroline. She was attentive,knowledgeable and fun","5, 1, 1, 1, 3"

While I enjoyed the food at the table better (can't beat a piping hot plate), it was delicious on both occasions. Just a great dining experience with some fresh pasta and a great cocktail menu. The bolognese and cacie e pepe that I had most recently for takeout came out great. I'm going back for dinner as soon as full service reopens.> Several weeks into the lockdown, I wanted something special, a really nice dinner date for myself and my husband, and turned to Fox & the Knife delivery- it was a fantastic idea! We had a wonderful date night, and all the food arrived perfectly and tasted amazing. The focaccia was absolutely out of this world: so moist and flavorful (not to mention how amazing it smelled) and with a delicious cheese! Honestly I would have ordered two of these. The brussels and burrata appetizers were also so good. For entrees, the pork milanesa came with an incredible sauce and salad, and the combination was way better than I expected. The pasta with boar Bolognese was quite light on the sauce, but still very tasty. Overall, such an delightful evening, I'm definitely coming back in person!> I have very mixed feelings about Fox And The Knife...We made a reservation about a month in advance, and the only time we could get for a table of four was 9:15. Not a big deal as it was a Saturday night, and we had hoped that a later reservation meant it would be less crowded. I was totally wrong. We got there 9:15 on the dot and the place couldn't have been more packed, it was elbow to elbow in the bar area. We didn't get seated until around 9:40 (I was not too happy that they didn't check in on us at all/provide updates), and were placed in a small high top that was very tight for 4 people. The hostess and waitress were very nice, said they would send us out some goodies for the wait, etc. Now the food was very very good, every bit as good as I keep hearing/reading. We ordered the focaccia & brussel sprouts, the luna & taglatelle (from pasta section), and the pork milanese & scallops (from the secondi section), to share. Everything was delicious particularly the luna & the pork milanese, both so light yet intensely flavored (it must be magic). Curiously I didn't think the focaccia was anything super special, given that's the one thing everyone raves about. Ours arrived kind of cold maybe that's why? Oh yes, we also had a salad, which was the ""goodies"" they said they would send.... One funny thing is everything we ordered pretty much came in 3 pieces. We weren't really bothered but it would have been nice if our waitress had mentioned it and asked if we wanted to add an extra piece or something. It made sharing a little hard. Anyway, we also ordered pretty much all of the desserts on the menu and some wine, and they were quite yummy as well. As you can see, I have no issues with the food or drinks, loved everything we had and would absolutely go back. I just really don't love the elbow to elbow trying to squeeze yourself in and make space for the waitstaff to maneuver kind of environment. It's awesome that they are doing well, and some things (like guests lingering) are not really within their control. But maybe better planning/spacing out reservations further, or limiting the amount of people that can be at the bar, would help. I want to go back, but will wait until the hype dies down a bit.> According to eater.com labels this spot one of America's best new restaurants of 2019, but my trip there didn't blow me away. Sure, the food was good, and the atmosphere was bustling, but there wasn't any singular dish that blew me away, and there were a few that were on the disappointing side. By no means was it a bad meal, but I'm not dying to go back either. If this was one of best new restaurants of 2019, it was a pretty mediocre year. The dishes that were hyped up to us didn't live up to expectations. Disappointing, but not terrible.> DINNER REVIEWWOW! Just WOW! I had heard good things about Fox & The Knife but I've also heard good things about other new restaurants and I've been disappointed. Not here! This was one of the best meals I've had in Boston and I can't wait to come back.WAIT: We went right when it opened and beware that the bar before the dining room does so we had to wait about 15 minutes. No big deal and I imagine that many of you will not be going right when it opens so check with others about prime time wait. Also something to consider: it's kind of isolated so if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait, not the best area to come for restaurantsFOOD: This is what we came for...when I took a look at the menu, it was short, especially for an Italian restaurant, but I LOVE short menus (I always do). It means they specialize and focus on making a few good things really good. That said, I think I could have ordered every thing on the menu and been very happy...each element of each dish was clearly intentional and there for a reason.It was only two of us so we didn't order too much but here is what we got:Focaccia Taleggio - ""$12 for focaccia?!"" you're probably thinking. But this isn't just homemade buttery focaccia (which alone would be worth it!). This is a FANCY grilled cheese with amazing melted cheese in the middle. This is a must-get! Better yet, get a couple!Harissa Braised Agnello - I am not a big pasta person so I went with this. This was a beautiful, tender, fall off the bone lamb shank over some delicious carrot polenta and top with mint gremolata. My only wish: That I ordered another.Pistachio Ice Cream Sandwich - My goodness, this off-menu dessert item is a MUST GET. I mean, you have to like pistachio but even if you do a little, GET IT. It's pistachio ice cream between these thin waffle cookies and then dipped in chocolate that has hardened and is drizzled with pistachios. It all held together really well which makes me think they assembled it beforehand. I think it's better that way because it's not too messy.Run, do not walk, to Fox & The Knife!","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

They have lots of beer and wine options and we took advantage of those options, it felt like a good day for some beers and barely legal seafood. Our one friend wasn't a fan of lobster or oysters so he opted for his mother country's staple food, fish and chips, or as we refer to them lovingly as fries. The lobster rolls were rich in butter and lovely with each bite. Could have eaten a second one but one was enough. My friend enjoyed his fish and chips. Can you really mess up fish and chips? We also had some starter dishes and they were also good too.> Love me some Legal but this location was tremendously disappointing experience for lunch on a weekend. Ambience/atmosphere was fun. Great exterior and nice interior. They have a lovely Koi pond. The interior space has some awkward seatings arrangements but not the worst. Service was challenging. We had an eager waitress but she looked stressed, disappeared for long periods of time, was complaining about the cooking staff being backed up to us in person and then audibly stating everyone was screwing things up today. When we asked about why other tables got their food (and similar dishes!) much quicker while our party had to wait she looked panicked. One manager seemed to ask her the same and if she delivered to the wrong table. We respectfully expressed our hunger and frustrations thrice with her, and then with the manager who stopped by who apologized. Unfortunately no expedited replacement of our food, and the bill was without any reparations or compensation. It wasn't even a busy day! Very disappointing. The food was generally good though some dishes obviously had been sitting out a long time and not at the ideal temperature. The seafood tower was flavorful but a smaller portion that I was expecting and the menu conveyed, especially compared to other Legal experiences. The kid menu items were quite bland -- massive plates of pasta and fries and very little of the veg or fruit advertised. The fisherman's chowder main course was amazingly rich and filling despite the quaint appearance. Price was as you'd expect for Legal and decent quality for higher prices than some competitors. The tower should have been cheaper for the selection offered. Overall wouldn't visit this Legal location again and definitely recommend avoiding if you're bringing your kids due to wait times and awkward seating arrangements.> Came here to try the lobster roll and boy was it the best in Boston. My wife and I tried 5 different places from casual to fine dining and Legal Sea Foods topped our list for hot buttery lobster rolls.The red sangria was sweet and good and the Sam Adams Lager was nice and cold. The crab cake was moist and tasty as well as the citrusy flavored salad. My only wish would be that the fries were more crisp when plated with the lobster roll, but that was minor compared to the star lobster roll. Definitely worth a taste... Of the wicked good lahbsta> I used to come here as a college student, but back then I could only afford it on special occasions because it broke my bank.Now that I'm older and can afford it I can't say it has the same special appeal it used to have.  The clam chowder is still one of the best in town. If you like the commercial variety that is starchy and uses sea clams.  Good ""clammy-flavor"".  But Down East in Maine it's more sour-milk based, and they use little necks or small steamers.For old time's sake I ordered the Baked Scrod.  It's kind of like going into an Italian place and ordering spaghetti and meatballs.  If you can't get the basics done right, then I'm not coming back.  So the Baked Scrod just didn't seem fresh.  I believe the white fish of the day was cod.  Just mediocre, and the breading could have been more buttery and crunchy.  Sorry Legal Sea Foods, your stock went way down in my book.  I'd only come back for another bowl of the chowdah.> Stopped by for dinner after the aquarium and had a wonderful dinner before heading up north. I got 6 oysters and a lobster roll for lunch. The lobster roll said market price which is quite a nerve wracking thing to see on the menu. Ended up being $30 or so for the roll. The lobster was cooked in butter and served on a warm roll. It was definitely delicious but not the best lobster roll I've had, especially at that price. The oysters were delicious and served with a nice array of sauces. We also got the crab dip to split and it was served with some weird rice chip, which was odd but the dip was very good. Definitely enjoyed everything but certainly could have been better.","4, 2, 5, 5, 3"

There was a short line (the host said about 15 minutes), but the table was ready much faster. You could actually join the waitlist on Yelp, but the whole party needs to be there to get seated. We sat close to the kitchen. The restaurant has a cozy ambience with a lot of wood decoration (including the ceiling) and good service. We got two pizzas (pistachio and pesto, carmine). Both were delicious. The dough has this great chewy wheaty taste. Our favorite was the pistachio and pesto pizza. The pesto sauce is not heavy, and just the right amount of pistachio to enhance the crunchiness and flavor. The waitress offered us a small bottle of balsamic vinegar sauce (the condensed version you sometimes would see on pizza). I highly recommend asking for it/adding it to any pizza with white sauce. Overall it was a satisfying dining experience. If you're around north end and crave high quality Italian style pizza, this is the spot!> Spent a recent Saturday eating my way through Boston recently.  By the time my wife and I reached the North End we were not super hungry but looking for a small meal to share.  A quick search of Yelp led us here.  The two of us shared a warm ricotta appetizer that was mild but very creamy and satisfying.  We also split a small pizza ""Parma due"" which was topped with Gorgonzola, figs, prosciutto and arugula.  Despite the quality toppings, I must admit the crust was a highlight.... especially the outer crust which was crunchy on the outside yet almost fluffy on the inside. I could have used a bit more crispness in the center but overall this was a very strong offering. Definitely will be back.> We got lucky by getting a table for two here on Valentine's Day! We sat in the window at a high top that was very comfortable since we could lean against the wall. Service was good, very nice. We ordered the garlic toast which came with dipping sauce which was steaming hot! We also ordered the margarita pizza which was fantastic. Cooked in a brick oven grill and with fresh basil, sauce, and fresh cheese. Yum. Appreciated that they had parmesan cheese and pepper sprinkle on the table. Perfectly satisfying!> Good place in North End for an affordable personal size brick oven pizza. While the place isn't big, it doesn't get busy with tourists so there were plenty of open tables during lunch. I had a Margherita pizza to which I added prosciutto. I enjoyed both the pizza and the service at Locale. This is a nice option for a pizza if you want something nicer than a pizza by the slice shop but don't want to go to any of the fancy and/or tourist packed restaurants in the North End.> Located in Boston's Little Italy, this is a simple pizza place that really brings the full Italian essence to its pizza. I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my ""Parma Due"" pizza (prosciutto, arugula, figs and gorgonzola). It was the perfect combination that brought me back to my last vacation to Italy. I ended up finishing (to my personal horror and shame) the entire pizza all by myself, but it was worth every last bite. Delectable.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

The food taste was slightly above average, but still lower than my expectation. However, the skewers were still very nice and worth trying. As a newly opened Chinese BBQ place, I believe they can do better and hope they don't drop their quality.> I was pretty eager to try this place because Boston doesn't really have an authentic Chinese BBQ skewers place. After trying this place, it definitely beats my expectations of skewers quality and flavor. From a service perspective, there is room for improvement. In terms of skewers, my friend and I ordered beef, lamb, chicken, Mongolian special lamb, octopus, and grilled scallops. Everything is very good and the spice they put on really adds to the taste. Highly recommend the octopus and Mongolian lamb. The New Orleans chicken also has a special smoky bbq taste. To wrap up, we ordered a spicy hot noodle soup to finish out the night.What leaves much to be desired is the service. I ordered a draft beer that is half foam, service was slow, but understandable given they just revamped this place and started fresh. They also charged me extra accidentally. From a pricing stand point, we spend about 40 dollars each  which is slightly on the expensive side but hard to argue with where the location is. Overall, definitely worth a try if you are looking for some authentic chinesE skewers> This place was hyped up for its NYC locations before and I'm excited that this authentic and popular Chinese BBQ restaurant eventually found its way in Boston! Haggis Soup in Pot (羊杂汤）- highly recommend! Haggis is a savoury mix of lamb/sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs). Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavor! It's rarely seen here in US, let alone cook it as well as it here! It's a whole new level of northern Chinese food!Seafood Rice Noodle Soup was great, too! Full of flavors and beautiful in color! Very fulfilling with one bowl!All the skewers are great!I came here with my friends on its second soft opening day. The wait was bad :/ we were told to wait 20-30 min but turned out over 1 hour, which was not pleasant. Waiters are very nice and friendly but not quite attentive. They kept apologizing for inefficient operation of the restaurant but I'd rather receiving fast service than apologies. I believe it will get better with a little effort though! Will come back!> Overpriced... the seafood boil for 2 is not spicy... not mala flavor just herbs. The seafood is not fresh at all... the grilled scallops and oyster is $5.99 each... kind of over grilled for the oyster and the scallop was small since they sliced it. The seafood rice noodle pot was okay but nothing special. Service is okay and kind of busy during lunch on Friday even the business is weak due to coronavirus but it is better than I thought. But I wouldn't come back again. The food doesn't worth the price.> This place is average. My friend suggested we check out this place, and we were excited to try this place out. We ordered the enoki mushroom pot and combo of small beef, lamb, and pork...and I could say they were SMALL.  We realized that we should have just ordered individually skewers, which we tried the Mongolian beef that had 4 pieces on one skewer.  I would recommend the Mongolian beef skewer. The service was slow, and the owner seemed to be the only one that would check in on us. Before we got our last skewer, one of the waiters gave us our bill. We might come back to try more skewers and hope the service would be better.","4, 4, 4, 1, 3"

I don't really eat a lot of cajun places here in MA, but I would come back. I don't really think it would be my go-to, but for the Allston-Brighton area, I'd say I would probably steer myself towards Holly Crab than anywhere else.So, I only got the Holly Crab flavor. My boyfriend and I got two bags. One of Spicy and another of Medium. First bite, I wasn't convinced that I liked this place as much as Cap't Loui (I go to the one in Stoneham), but the more I ate it, the more the flavor got better. The only thing is, I don't think there was much of a difference between the Spicy and the Medium.Fresh crawfish obviously wasn't in season since it was winter time but it was still good and meaty. Snow crab legs were also full of meat and could really soak up the Holly Crab flavor. Snow crab is also my boyfriend's favorite. My boyfriend liked the shrimp (I can't really say much since I'm not too much of a shrimp eater). It's a solid place to go to, but I can't really say I'm in love with it? But I'm also not saying I hate it.Service was ok when wait staff would come around, but they don't really come around much. It's kind of just a hi and bye.> Been a loyal customer for 3 years and have seen it go down hill ever since the renovation. Sauce is no longer chunky and full of flavor, now it's watered down. Shrimp used to be fresh but definitely taste frozen now. We ordered fried oysters and chicken wings tonight and were blown away(in a negative way). Oysters were definitely frozen and were EXTREMELY fishy. When we ordered the chicken wings they told us it would be 25 minutes. After looking at the restaurant we realized all the tables already had their entree's so where's he wait time from? Holly Crab Sauce was lacking significant flavor. Not sure what changed from before the renovation but flavor and quality have continued to go downhill ever since.Lastly, it's November 10th and your server said that Sam Adams Summer was the Sam Seasonal option haha. We've already past Summer, October Fest, and are now onto Winter. Does that mean the Winter will be available in May 2020?> The recent visit disappointed me. I always visited this place for its seafood, but the last order from them was not fresh at all. Disgusted taste with powdery meat showed the shrimps were not properly stored or just not fresh.Then the mussels were extremely fishy and contains lots of sands(some hard crystal stuff). The sauce only had a spicy taste, then nothing. I am upset. I will look for a new place which cook seafood with the same style.> If you're from California and craving some ""boiling crab""-like seafood, this is the place for you! I would definitely go here for a pound of shrimp with all the flavors + medium-spice level, a bowl of rice, and corn on the cob. The flavoring is not as good as Boiling Crab, but it comes close -- enjoy!> I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food. The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good. As for some additional foods:- Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin.- Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice. Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty.","4, 2, 2, 4, 4"

Been wanting to go so long since I was raised in Dorchester and LOVE NKOTB and Marky Mark.  I have to say I was disappointed. The burger was okay, but raw. Had I known I would have told them well, well, well done. They didn't even ask how I wanted my burger. I think they should ask and not just serve the raw hamburgers to everyone. I'll probably give them another chance - the menu looks interesting, but right now, I'm good with Five Guys.I did buy the chili and will update if the chili is AWESOME!Updating: the chili WAS AWESOME!!! I'll email you... thank you for paying attention to lil ole' me and my comments.> I come here often during my lunch breaks. I love getting their crispy haddock sandwich. Some of the items on the menu have been hit or miss for me. The employees there are super friendly but they have tendency to get my order wrong whenever I order through their mobile app which is disappointing. Luckily I work around the corner so I can just come in if there is a mistake but definitely should improve on getting orders correct. I have never sat down to eat here because it's always busy during the times I have come but if you like burgers then wahlburgers has a good selection of good burgers. They are pretty expensive so I wouldn't come here all the time. Burger will cost you anywhere from 8-$13. They have a good selection of salads if you are vegetarian and they just recently introduced the ""Impossible Burger"" to their menu that is worth trying out.> Don't waste your money! Just Spent $50 on lunch- curbside pick up , the staff forgot to put any plastic forks or spoons , essential for Mac n cheese.  Their phone rang out and I had to walk back in where the staff stood about and I requested plastic forks and napkins- burgers were disgusting and fries were not much better.

The soup tasted incredibly savory and fresh (because it's seafood, freshness is key). Came with a packet of oyster crackers.They were giving out free samples of the clam chowder so if you're on the fence about getting it, see if you can't try it first. I know it won't disappoint ;).For me, the small at $5.99 was just the right size for a mid-day snack and it's also pretty affordable. If only I had more room in my stomach, I would have definitely gotten it in a bread bowl, yum!They also have lobster rolls and various types of seafood pies, although the lobster roll is a little outside of my price range. Regardless, I'll definitely have to come back and try some of their other menu items.> The chowder was so good! It came in a meal with the butter lobster roll. I enjoyed the chowda waay more than the roll. Locals probably think it's so basic, but we don't have anything like this one in Sonoma. I'm definitely a fan of the marketplace in Faneuil Hall. I think this place wouldn't be the same without Boston Chowda. Walk and eat or find a place to stand. The market was packed both times I went. So let's talk about that roll though. Lots of lobster pieces stacked on each other stuffed in a bread roll. Lightly buttered and some sort of toasty ness from the texture. It all came together pretty well, but it was extremely dry. I was hoping for the lobster roll to be warm and buttery. Sadly not. It is crazy expensive too. $25 for this meal. Not worth it. Next time I can ditch the lobster roll and cut the cost by two hundred percent.> This was my fist time visiting this specific place and came here specifically for the lobster rolls and and I was not disappointed. It is located inside the Faneuil Hall, I have been there in the past but never inside and I heard and seen the reviews and I was glad I tried it. It is on the pricier side but I was out there visiting and wanted to taste the lobster rolls. I also ordered a side of clam chowder, nothing special but still very good and tasty. Since the Faneuil Hall is big we found seating on the second floor it was quite and we had some natural sunlight come in thru the big windows which kept us nice and warm. There's plenty of places to try lobsters roll inside the market but I am glad I tried this one in particular. The are fast and good.> While visiting Boston in a really chilly weather, we were feeling like getting a nice cup of soup. What's better than soup? Chowder! What's better than a cup of soup? Chowder in a bread bowl!!! You have some good options when you are at Faneuil Hall, and I heard Boston Chowda does really nice bread bowl. So, we decided to get one from there. Also, their lobster roll on the display looked amazing, so we decided to get that too. We got the New England Clam Chowda in Bread Bowl. The bread bowl was a nice size, and it was surprisingly good. Chowder was good too, lots of little potatoes. Creamy and comforting, great on a cold day! Hot Buttered Lobster Roll is their signature sandwich. It didn't look like the display, the one on display had maybe twice as much lobster meat in there... Anyways, it was sooo buttery! It still had a nice amount of lobster meat, soft and juicy. However, one of the lobster meat had big shells attached to it, which was annoying... Other than that, it was very tasty! It was the perfect lunch for us, exactly what we wanted. The price was affordable too. Nice spot to try some Boston lobster roll and clam chowder!> We were planning a trip to Faneuil Hall and once I saw that Boston Chowda Company served bread bowls, I was in. We arrived around 10:00 AM right before the huge lunch rush so we were able to order and get served in about 5 minutes. Once you leave with your meal, your best bet is to immediately turn to the right and grab one of the standing tables. It's less crowded and still easy to enjoy your chowder at. My New England clam chowder was really satisfying. It was piping hot and chock full of clams in every bite. The bread bowl was the perfect vessel for every creamy bite. The bread bowl had a nice chew to it and tasted freshly baked.My boyfriend had the lobster bisque, and while tasty, he didn't find even the smallest piece of lobster in it. I don't know if they just purée the lobster into it and that's why there were no chunks, or maybe he was just unlucky.Our total for two bread bowls and two fountain sodas was around $25. We were definitely stuffed after, so I would say this is one of the better ""bang for your buck"" restaurants at Faneuil Hall.","5, 3, 4, 4, 4"

We wanted to really love this place and had been looking forward to going.   They say to always start with the positive...The wine list is rather good and pretty reasonably price with a vast selection and unique wines;The location is just superb and the restaurant itself is very nice, not to mention the view is exceptional. Keeping the deltas short and to the point.   Waitress was terrible as she kept disappearing for very long periods of time and we seemed to be interrupting her each time she came to the table - which usually required us asking the support staff to have our waitress come to the table. We received far better service  from the support staff - thank you again to David who at least tried to help.  The menu is creative but lacking at the same time. The pastas are bland, lamb is just plain and poorly prepared with some sort of attempt at a soy sauce, charred broccoli was very good but the cheese sauce was overbearing and way too much, the steak was gross albeit cooked as ordered, beet salad was just ok but almost tasted like a refrigerator.  Hot dishes we not serviced hot.  5 of us for dinner, couple of bottles of wine was just over 140 a person with tip.  Given the quality of food and terrible service from the waitress,  I'd say we all left very disappointed, underwhelmed and wanting a much better experience from one of Boston's newest restaurants in the Seaport.> I know you have heard about the New England lobster rolls, but have you tried the lobster popover here?

It was our big night out, and the second to last day of our honeymoon. We made reservations earlier that week, taking a chance based on the reviews that it would be good. We were a little concerned when we walked in, the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately. The food was outstanding. The drinks were well balanced. Although we thought our waiter was a little unenthusiastic compared to the others on staff, he surprised us with a free dessert, after finding out we had just been married. We had a lovely time, and this really made our honeymoon unforgettable. We already have plans on another Boston trip - that includes a dinner at the Mistral!> I came to Mistral with a colleague for dinner when we were attending a conference. The staff were accommodating that we were a bit late for our reservation, which was appreciated. The decor combines an intimate, dimly lit aesthetic with classic furniture. Highlights on the meal:-Our -The steak carpaccio was an enjoyable dish with small bread pieces throughout, although the meat itself and the herbs stole the show. -Linguine was super fresh and exploding with flavor up front -I enjoyed the blueberry tart as well. I perhaps ate it too quickly as it was gone before I knew it!Our server, Tiffany, was very friendly and helpful. She offered a tasting between two reds that I was vacillating between (I preferred the Campo al Mare Bolgheri). The folks at the table next to us were super sociable and added to the lightness of the environment, which is always welcome at a white table cloth restaurant. Mistral was veritably enjoyable, and I would certainly come back.> I haven't lived in Boston for 3 years now but I still hold Mistral up as THE golden standard for brunch. The food is delicious and the presentation is absolutely beautiful. I love the huge windows and high ceilings. In my opinion the price is definitely worth the VIP treatment you get here.> My two teenage daughters and I went on a recent Sunday morning for a late breakfast. I can't begin to tell you how great our breakfast was. The girls shared the cinnamon rolls. They're handmade and came out warm from the oven. Magnificent!! Two of us had frittatas, and the third had eggs Benedict. Everything was fresh and hot and could not have been better.

To be honest, I've never heard of it. I'm from Atlanta, so I guess not a chain we have.First, I really hate to read reviews that complain about cleanliness for paragraphs. There was an obvious odor when I walked in. An employee came out quickly and it was obvious he was trying to find the source. Garbage cans were emptied and that seem to solve it.I had the 1/4 lb with cheese and a few other condiments. Of course fries to solve the craving. Overall, both were excellent. The burger is a great size and was very filling. The burger had a fantastic char from the flattop covered by a fresh bun. Fries were fresh and well seasoned. Since I'm in Boston on a regular basis, looks like I found a new burger spot.> Ordered from Mooyah many times in 2020 thus far, my go-to burger place for a solid meal. Only real downside is the large portions they offer (not a real downside in my mind, but my body says differently after the meal!). Orders always arrive quickly, food usually arrives still warm which is impressive as the restaurant is about 4-5 miles away from Southie. Generally, I get the same meal every time I order from MOOYAH - Mooyah Double Cheeseburger (with all the onion options, bacon, and a heap of other add-ins) with a side of family fries. Rarely do I eat the entire meal, but everything is delicious. From the crispness of the bacon, to the well done cooked burger to the crispness of the bun, there is little left needed. Add in the fries, can't ask for a much better meal (albeit probably contains a million calories but who cares!). My go-to burger place in Boston, would rate a 4.5/5 if possible. Will order again (probably soon!).> Yes, they forgot the sauces I had requested on the side, and yes, my burger arrived stuffed within a potato roll when I had ordered it with an Iceburger bun.  But their response was quick when I asked for the sauce, and their attitude was terrific when I mentioned the error and asked for the lettuce ""bun"" - the fellow manning the cash register offered that they could replace the bun for me, which I realized would probably be the better idea.Once accurate, my burger was now a round ball of lettuce stuffed with a beef patty, American Cheese, sliced avocado, fried onion strings, grilled onions, pickles, and tomato.  It was a bit of a mess to eat, with the juices dribbling past the foil, but I enjoyed my hand-held salad meal.The Half Idaho & Half Sweet Potato Fries were like two side orders in their own right in any other burger shop.  Both were good, though I might suggest more salt on the regular fries if I had been doing without dunking sauce.  The sweet potato variant was the soft sort.  I enjoyed both with their Thousand Island like MOOYAH sauce.The banana shake was worthy of the pearl milk tea sized straw they gave me.I was happy with my meal.Build Your Own:Certified Angus Beef - Single $5.59 American Cheese $1.00 Sliced Avocado $1.29(all other veggies and sauces was with no charge)+ half fries/sweet potato fries+ milk shake> We stopped in Mooyah while we were getting ready to walk the Freedom Trail. Holy cow, these are amazing burgers!  We got the Cheddar Bacon Burger, the Double Diablo and the  Mushroom Swiss Burger. We loved them. They were a great value. We highly recommend this place!> If you know and love Smashburger, this is maybe one notch better. My friend and I had lunch here before a flight back home. There was no line around 1 pm on a Friday so we were able to order right away.I ordered:1. Grilled chicken sandwich with multigrain wheat bread, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, and (on the side) Mooyah sauce (Thousand Island dressing)2. Sweet potato fries3. Oreo milkshake Simply put, everything tasted utterly delectable!! (Yes, two exclamation points, for those who remember me from that episode in Netflix!!)The chicken was a huge slab, extremely fresh and flavorful, with perfectly and evenly melted cheese, vibrant lettuce and tomatoes, just enough pickled jalapenos to give it that kick, sandwiched between a delicious (and healthy!) bun. The sweet potato fries were served hot, not greasy, and nicely cooked with finger-length pieces and a delicious dipping sauce. Lip-smackin' good!I wanted two milkshakes like a glutton but one was still delicious! Perfectly blended plus visible pieces of Oreo that I scooped up voraciously with a spoon. There's also plenty of seating inside but sit strategically if you want to charge your phone. I didn't see any outlets near the upper area where we sat. Now go get some MOOYAH!

Nice interior and warm dim lights.~Usually for two people we order Chefs choose of meze and one main dish. Lamb gyro was ordered by us again :)I like that some items stay on menu longer while others change. It is probably the vegetables cooked in the best possible way. ~The service is nice as well even though last time they caught forgetting to bring one out of 4 meze but we got it in the end so...count how many dishes you order and how may you get :) Desserts are small but very rich in taste. ~Again, it is a must visit place!UPD: came there again and they forgot fourth meze out of chefs choice set again :( be careful!> More like 3.5, although the score varies depending on what you order and your preference. A cozy, trendy middle eastern restaurant that pushes the wine heavy and offers a hit and miss menu that frustrates and delights. The fatteh is a beautiful construction of a dish. The layout looks like it could be a modernist house for an insect! The textured are well thought out, as there's three different types of crunch. The yogurt has a lovely tang that ties everything together. Every bite felt like a chamber orchestra in my mouth. Definitely make sure to get this.The spinach falafel was good, but not as amazing as everything else. If anything, this would be something id eat for a healthy lunch. As a vegan, this will strike your heart as hearty, nutritional, earthy vibes. I would have dialed the cumin down by one notch, but thats just me.The lamb tortellini is delicious. Each tortellini feels like a small package, specially wrapped under the Christmas tree. The flavor of the lamb shines like a pattern from a boat surrounded by a lake of labneh. The labneh itself comes off like pimento cheese sauce but in a good way. The mint oil adds a brushstroke of freshness while further anchoring the oil profile of the dish, although it never gets overwhelming. I'm glad they dont serve it piping hot, but it does get lukewarm fairly quick.The Quail kebobs were quite underwhelming for being the last item of my meal. I expected this to be small, but I wasn't expecting it to taste like chicken breast covered in a nutty parmesan pesto crust. Out of all the dishes, this one fell flat like a middle schooler's voice breaking halfway through the final note of his cadenza. The birds nest dessert was not as good as other bird's nests Ive had at other places. It felt like everything was its own separate part, rather than a total sum. The cheese board like layout of some of the ingredients feel compartmentalized, as well as incomplete as a ""nest of a bird"". The redeeming factor is everything was solid in how it tasted. No cheap chocolate, no flat flavors. The honeycomb is candy and not real honeycomb, but I honestly didn't mind since it was more about texture (and I didn't want a sugar rush as I was already full). Im really glad I didn't order the Sultan's delight prix fixe option. I have a feeling I would have scored this place much more harshly than I am now. Granted, I didn't eat every item on the menu. I think overall it's a hit or miss experience. If I lived in the neighborhood, perhaps I would be able to fully explore the menu, but alas I don't live in Boston. This would not be my first choice or recommendation to come here if you have a limited stay in Boston, but for locals, Id say its still worth going to. Just make sure you do plenty of research ahead of time.> So I'm visiting Boston and everyone says get a lobster roll...eat the clam chowder...order cannoli...and while those items were good, nothing really felt special in Boston until I ate at Oleana.   This was such a small, cozy restaurant tucked away in a residential neighborhood that we couldn't find the restaurant until we literally walked in front of it.  I don't even remember a sign...if there was, it was small.Two favorite dishes of the night were the lemon chicken and the mini butternut dolma.  For the dolma, the goat cheese and sumac work so well together and then the tomato brown butter mellows it out.  The lemon chicken was moist, had a flavorful za'atar layer on top and the cheese pancake was the perfect piece to go on the bottom.  The one disappointing dish was the hummus.  I like my hummus smoother and this one was a bit dry (which it had to be to hold the shape it was in I assume) and almost grainy.  Taste was only okay.  If I'm ever in Boston again, I will definitely hit this place up again and skip getting another lobster roll.> I had been meaning to try Oleana for a birthday or anniversary celebration for a couple of years but never planned ahead enough to get a reservation. You really need to plan four weeks in advance if you want a weekend reservation, maybe not quite as far out during the week. Recently, we finally actually visited Oleana for dinner while my in laws were visiting. We were a group of five and shared a number of small plates and a few desserts. We were very pleased with our experience at Oleana. There are a number of nice restaurants in the Cambridge area for a fancy dinner, but Oleana with its Mediterranean-inspired fine dining is definitely unique and a great option for something a bit different. When we arrived, the free parking for Oleana customers was the first thing we appreciated. When we went inside, our table is ready and we were seated right away. The dining area was cozy and pleasant, and the staff were very helpful in terms of recommending what and how much to order. With five people, we were able to try a lot of the small plates on the menu, and everything was delicious. We would definitely recommend this place for a nice night out. They also have a vegetarian dinner option with a chef's choice assortment of small plates, although we chose to just select our own from the menu.> I'm so happy I finally was able to come here!  Oleana is the real deal.  I loved it!  Our table wasn't ready when we arrived at the restaurant, however, we went to the bar and sipped on some wine to pass the time.  The restaurant is very warm and homey with Mediterranean inspired decoration.   it appeared the restaurant guests were locals in the area.  Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions of her favorite menu items I came for a date night and suggest ordering small plates for your meal .  We were pretty hungry so we ordered 5 plates, not including dessert (the more the merrier right?!).  We ordered strictly off of the hot meze section of the menu and got the honey nut squash,spinach falafel, fateh, mini butternut dolma, and lamejun.  For dessert we had the chocolate marquise!  Here is a breakdown of our favorite items.Lamejun- my favorite dish of the night! This was like a mini Mediterranean pizza of goodness! The lamb and sauce on top paired perfectly together! Mini butternut dolma- WOW! The lamb in this dish was amazing.  It was so tender and was easy enough to cut with a fork.  The goat cheese on top hit the spot!Chocolate marquise- who would've thought pear sorbet paired well with chocolate? Not me but it was delicious!  The spiced pecan katif offered a nice crunch!","5, 5, 3, 5, 4"

Food still arrived hot and in good condition, we were excited for the meal! Like most Chinese / Japanese restaurants, I got chicken fried rice. Overall, taste was good although the size of carrots and broccoli were a little too large for my liking. Additionally, the quantity was slightly lacking as I was still hungry after eating the entire meal. Really not too much else to say, given I don't enjoy the cuisine too much but one of the better Restaurants in Boston I've tried. Disappointed with no fortune cookie or tiny cracker sticks.

The guy at the counter was very helpful in helping me make my decision on what to orseI got the large steak burrito and the shrimp fajita wrap, with guacamole added. Both items were hefty in size and full of flavor. The steak was very tender and shrimps were very juicy. The shrimp fajita was almost impossible to eat though because the juices kept spilling out with each bite. I was forced to use a fork to eat my wrap. But with 2 added drinks, I spent about $28.

The furniture surrounding the place seem straight out of Williams Sonoma. The menu is split into three sections - really small plates, small plates, and pasta. For two, I recommend getting a risotto that is a big enough entree for two people, along with two small plates. We had the risotto, salmon, broccoli, and sorbet for dessert and each were on the mark!The place is popular but big enough where you can usually get a last-minute reservation and it's a great way to spend a couple hours.> Made a reservations for 2 at 5:15 pm. It took about 10 minutes to find street parking. We decided to try the arsenale tasting menu. We got:Cicchetti-Salted cod black bread -Olive fritte-Polpette meatballs  -Octopus  Piatti -Lolla rosa salad-Smoked sea trout-RibeyePasta-Rigatoni with oxtail, carrot, broccolini, pecorino-Pasta with snails and mint Dessert-Brownie with kumquat and espresso gelato The cicchetti were all brought out within 3 minutes, which made us feel rushed. However, the rest of the dishes were timed well. The piatti were my favorite, but everything was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and worked well with each other. When we ordered, the server asked for any allergies or aversions. I looked over the dinner menu and informed her I didn't like beets and they made sure no dishes had beets. However, the snail pasta that they served was not listed on the menu. I didn't enjoy the snail texture or taste. I hope in the future they inform you of the dishes on the tasting menu or provide a list of main ingredients they plan on using for the dishes, especially if something is not on the main menu.Overall great experience and I would definitely visit again!> One of the best South End restaurants (please at me on this), SRV's bar menu (Venetian small plates) definitely rivals the dinner options. Light yet packed with flavor, SRV is where we go for dinner, drinks and apps, and late night drinks. The wonderful folks behind the bar are always so friendly and knowledgable, it feels like a privilege for this to be our neighborhood spot (shoutout to John!)Be sure to get one of Chef Meg's desserts, she's always serving up the most surprising combinations (often times mixing in vegetables with sweeter flavors) -- trust me it works!> This restaurant has been on my bucket list for quite some time and I am so happy that we finally got to check it out. Hence, it was only for an after dinner drink, but it was still amazing. Because of the Pandemic with the COVID-19, the South End was a ghost town and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. Plus, it was pretty late too. We ordered an espresso martini for my husband and I had an after dinner drink with Mezcal (can't remember the name). I liked the espresso martini much better, but the ambience set the tone for a romantic evening and a great way to end the night! I can't wait to come back here for a full dinner experience, maybe for my bday in May. Fun fact: SRV stands for Serene Republic of Venice :) Your welcome...lol!> It's white truffle season and the risotto with truffles are dahvine.  A good wine caps the meal.   You can also opt for shavings of truffle to your pasta.  Dude, but you're dining in SRV,  live like a Venetian or Northern Italian and get the risotto with truffles!!    There is an upcharge for the truffle enhancement but well worth the deliciousness if you're a fan of white truffle.     As in visits ago, plates are very Venetian -- simple and fresh, undeniably typical of the area yet modernized.   The chef/owners here know what they are doing.   Paired with good wine and the dining experience at SRV turns out to be refined and enjoyable yet not as expensive as Venice.  I lived in Venice for 3 summers and this place brings me back.Service was a bit disjointed this time with empty plates left on our table for a loooooong time.  I hope it gets better.  Meno una stella .","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

Located right in the heart of Back Bay among a plethora of options this is a great place to grab a meal. The space is clean and well organized with easy labels so you can get whatever you want in your bowl.I recently went and got supergreens, chicken, tons of vegetables, sauce, and toppings. You can get as many toppings as you want for free which is great for someone who is indecisive like I am. Plus up to three dips! Everything tasted fresh and you could see the staff refilling everything to make sure it was fresh.The customer service here is great! Everyone is friendly and makes sure you get exactly what you want on your bowl. They are also happy to give recommendations if you're unsure on what to get. I'd return for the service alone!> CAVA tries to be the Chipotle of Mediterranean food, but unlike Chipotle they're super stingy with their portions. For the $11 I spent on this sad little bowl, I could've gotten a fat burrito WITH guac down the street and still have change leftover.As a fast food chain (though they market themselves as health food, lol) you either have good ingredients or good portions, and CAVA is a strong 'meh' on both. If you want Mediterranean, Halal Guys is better, cheaper, and doesn't try to gaslight you about being healthy.> Solid!!  Love the toppings, so original and fresh!!Music a bit loud so minus one star.Also a bowl with no meat and a soda set me back $14.15. Dunno about that.> I'm sorry Chipotle, but we need to see other people. I have CAVA in my life now.This place blew the doors off my expectations. I literally just searched Yelp for Mediterranean food and picked this place just because it was close by. The atmosphere is very modern and trendy but casual, too. It's set up like a chipotle where you build your own bowl at the counter and have the choice of sitting down and eating your creation or taking it to go. There's more seating than you think because they have a whole separate extra seating room, as well as outdoor seating. I was here at 12:30 and there were still a lot of tables available inside and 4 outside on the patio. The food is out of this world. I got a bowl with saffron rice, chicken, lemon herb tahini, and a buuuunch of other yummy ingredients. I loved how many choices there were. At first I thought the price was too high until I saw the portion size (look at my pic attached to this review). It would be very difficult/impressive to finish this in one sitting.The only thing I don't like about this place is that there's not one where I live. Can't wait till I can come here again!> This was a really fast and healthy option, you can build your own bowl which was what I went with; superfood greens as much base, basmati trice for the grain, Tziki sauce, hummus, and eggplant sauce, then their roasted vegetables are really good plus their falafels are nice as well!

Thank you guys for being so flexible and for sharing your food with us in these trying times.> This review is for their Dine Out Boston menu ($33/person for 3 courses), so it may not be the most representative of their regular menu. Sadly the Dine Out Boston menu was a big disappointment...The meal started with some tasty bread that came with roasted garlic in olive oil. The bread was awesome-- super soft on the inside with a chewy crust. This made me very hopeful for the rest of the meal, but unfortunately I think the bread was the highlight for me.For the appetizers we tried both the chicories and herb salad and the shrimp & grits. The salad tasted very refreshing because it had fruits (apples and pomegranate) in addition to a bright, tangy vinaigrette. But it wasn't terribly special and I feel like I could get a similar tasting salad at a typical cafe. The shrimp & grits was nicely seasoned. The grits were shaped into a cake and seared, which formed a crispy base. But again, it tasted like something I could easily make at home.The entrees were pretty disappointing. The braise pork osso bucco was extremely dry and came with a heaping serving of equally dry beans. The seared black bass was tender, but pretty bland and came with another excessively large serving of cabbage. The protein-to-vegetable ratio on the two entrees seemed off balance. I probably wouldn't complain so much if the vegetables tasted better, but unfortunately they weren't anything special.We both got the blueberry miso crumb cake for dessert. The serving was pretty big-- each plate came with 3 small slices of cake. The cake wasn't too sweet and paired well with the blueberry compote and creme fraiche.Food-wise, I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by my visit. However the servers were very attentive and friendly. If their regular menu items are anything like the Dine Out Boston menu items, then I definitely won't be coming back.> Honestly I would give Metropolis a 1 Star had it not been for the good customer service.My coworker had heard this was a tasty restaurant, so I came in on a Saturday for brunch with high hopes and an empty stomach! I ordered what seems to be quite popular here, the huevos rancheros. As you can see by my picture, the item that came out was really disappointing. There was what looks to be a slice of Krafts single cheese slabbed onto my brunch order.... they couldn't even melt it for me?! Looking back at Yelp pictures, it seems as if the cheese is normally grated and placed on the order, which begs the question of WHAT HAPPENED?? How lazy can you be?!Aside from the cheese slice, the tortilla strips on the top were stale and the meat in the huevos rancheros was hard :( Honestly, everything with the order was just unimpressive. My friends ordered the pastrami hash and they said that item wasn't good either. There were wayyy too many strike outs during my visit for me to return. Unfortunately, Metropolis was a no for me.> Great date spot. My wife and I live around the corner from this place and finally made it over. We were very satisfied. I had the duck breast and my wife had the rigatoni.  Both were amazing. The duck was basically perfectly cooked and flavor was awesome. The sauce of the rigatoni was also very good. The service was great and we'd definitely go back with some friends. The place is tiny and reservations were tough. We went really early on a Saturday afternoon and we were okay.> Over ten years later and Metropolis is still a stand out. The menu is largely unchanged - chicken, veal (well, really the cauliflower gratin side) and rigatoni all phenomenal. Salads are all really solid and the Brussels sprouts dish is a sleeper on the app menu. Simple cocktails and solid wine list. And best of all, it's cozy as all heck. Though I no longer live in SoEnd, it's places like Metropolis that make me miss it desperately. Ask any local to the 'hood and it'll be on their top 5 list, trust me","5, 3, 2, 4, 5"

Cocktails have room for improvement but Il Molo makes up for it with an extensive fantastic wine list.  Is definitely a hidden gem right off the main track of the north end.  A must dine!> I took a group of 13 to IL Molo. We shared 12 dishes and asked to have them served 4 at a time. The first 4 came out barely warm. After complaining the next 8 were nice and hot.The bread we were originally served tasted like it had been sliced long ago as the exposed surfaces were stale. After complaining, we received delicious fresh bread for the rest of the mesl3 of our dishes contained lobster but all I found were the claw tips. When asked, they admitted 2 only had the tips but said that the lobster pie had tail meat but I couldn't find any.The scallops were delicious as well as the spaghetti and clams and lobster pie. The seafood stew was plentiful and tasty except for the tough lobster claw tips. When I have lobster at home, the tips go to my dog. It seems that more and more restaurants only serve claws which leads me to believe they are not cooking whole lobsters but just buying pre-cooked claws which are most likely far less expensive than tails. (This is my hypothesis and not a verified fact for Il Molo.) The service was good and our party overall liked our meals.> The service and food was fantastic. Our server had great recommendations for wine that both my husband and I loved. The mussels were beautiful done with a great broth that made us ask for a second round of bread to sop it up. We then split an order of linguini and clams that was perfectly seasoned with al dente pasta. I would return here in a second!> Such a good italian/seafood destination! Came for dinner to meet up with some friends in the area and was surprised I had never heard of it while living in Boston for 6 years for school. It's a little separated from the rest of the North End and has a slightly more modern and sea-themed feel/decor. Don't let the seashells and starfish fool you though, you still get amazing quality pasta and italian flavors!Prix fixe menu: $32 for 3 courses, and you get a lot of food! I took home leftovers. I had the grilled lamb skewers, the lasagna, and the rum cake (as they were sadly all out of the gelato and the cannoli that night). The lamb was cooked really well, the lasagna was super flavorful and cheesy, and the cake was moist and delicious! Oysters: not pictured, but we went for a selection of 3 total, one of each variety they had that day. They came with lemon, tabasco, and two sauces-one of them was raspberry flavored which was kind of fun!Swordfish: really really good! The cook on the fish was perfect and it had a good crispiness on the outside. Definitely worth it and the quality you would expect with the Boston Harbor basically right outside.> Awesome experience here. Lovely fruity olive oil with crusty bread to start, tasty lobster rangoon with nice chunks of lobster in it, and beautiful main dishes. The only negative was the bar tender- who was not nice. The waitress and hostess were over the top helpful and attentive though. I got the pasta arrabbiata with mussels and octopus, and my friend got a fish dish which had salsa and lobster in top. They make the pasta there and the seafood is extremely fresh.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

Antipasto was refreshing with a light dressing. It's a combination of lettuce, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. Nice way to start a meal with a glass of wine and antipasto. The lasagna was tasty too. We paired everything with a nice bottle of wine. Their wine list is pretty big. Most selection is Italian and American. Their wine prices are very decent and wine matches the style of the food they serve. The restaurant itself has a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Lots of wood, quite music on the background, view of a wine cellar.  Good place to have a couple dinner or small gathering.> I've been to La Famiglia's several times before and I've always been happy with the food and especially the portion size, which is HUGE (think 3 meals worth). This time, I was really blown away - the food was better than I remembered. I think there is a disparity because I ordered the specials this time, as opposed to X pasta with X sauce. There were four of us and we split three entrees and one salad. We ended up taking leftovers.Al's Favorite - I definitely recommend. It came with chicken, broccoli, gnocchi, and vodka sauce. This was the favorite of the night.Tortellini with chicken and pesto sauce - Also a favorite of the night. The pesto was very creamy.Lasagna with bolognese - this was definitely good lasagna with creamy filling, but it was the least favorite, simply because the specials were excellent.Caprese salad - fresh and delicious with soft mozzarella.They also serve bread and dipping oil at the  start of the meal. Overall, they have delicious food and very reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. We went at 6pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 mins.> ""Help me! I think I've fallen in love again!""...With this Warm cozy spot found on Salem st... For a quick minute, I died and ended up in my Nana's kitchen ... Service was attentive right from the start.

Waitstaff extremely intelligent and gracious, offering excellent suggestions at every instance. (This differs from some previous experiences  I've had in the north end). Wine offering was very good and the price points accessible. But the food ... the food is why we go... and it is the best I have had in the north end.

The bread is fresh and warm with a bit of hot in the olive oil dipping sauce.  We could have gotten one plate and shared but my other likes eating big!We will be back, we bring our visitors here always a memorable dinner or lunch.> Great place to gather and be welcomed as if one of the family..!La Famiglia Giorgio, located down a narrow side street on the Northside, smack dab in little Italy.  Seriously, as we walked around with google leading the way we felt like we were transplanted to another time and place.   Love the location.  Very quaint.  Parking can be a little challenging. Recommended by our knowledgeable Bostonian friends, we knew we were in for a treat.  At 5pm we were quoted a wait of an hour for a party of eight.  When the last person of our group arrived and checked in with the host about 5 minutes later we were taken right in.  So nice to know a relation of the Godfather.  From a tiny bar downstairs with a few tables we were ushered upstairs which opened up to a rather roomy dining room full of life and noise.  Everyone talking, singing, having a great time!The service was quick, efficient, jovial.  The food was, well it was in MASSIVE proportions!   Our friend who recommended Giorgio's was most familiar with the huuge menu so we happily left the ordering to him.  Had a sampling of antipasti salad, chicken parmigiana, large meatballs, clams...what didn't we have?!!? Unfortunately three of us forgot to tell him we were doing low/no carbs so you can imagine the infinite amount of leftovers!  Lol.  All delicious.Thank you Larry and Judy, thank you Cindy and the Godfather's nephew for a most memorable evening!","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Well done!> I went to Lulu shortly after they opened. They were giving out delicious fudgy brownie samples, and I tried the pear ginger scone from the bakery case. I thought it had good flavor, but I didn't love the texture. I enjoyed a pear jasmine kombucha, and I also had the barbecued cauliflower. It had really delicious flavors and good bread (it tastes grilled not like bbq sauce). I would definitely get it again without the vegan cheese. I look forward to going back and trying their full menu, especially the waffles!> Awesome spot for a fresh and healthy lunch! My friend and I checked it out today and were so impressed! I had the cauliflower sandwich and she had the burger. Both were flavorful and delicious! All of the staff were extremely kind and helpful, and made us feel very welcome. The rest of the menu (and all the baked goods) looks awesome! Can't wait to return!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

Absolutely over the top dining experience. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere. Steak cooked to perfection! Came for DineoutBoston March 2020 and they were incredibly generous with their portion size. Their snicker sundae is to die for!> I have to say that the steak I had at Grill 23 was the best I've ever had in Boston! Me and the rest of my party got the 100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye (Medium Rare). It was incredibly tender with just the right amount of sauce and crisp! They've also got a vast selection of wine to pair with your meal. Their sides were also made quite well (especially the Grill 23 Tots). I made my table reservation through OpenTable and my personal request was well-met. The entire restaurant was filled the night that we were here, so it was quite difficult to hear sometimes with all the conversations going on.> Updated in December 2019:Grill 23 consistently provides both incredible food and service and I'm here to give it that fifth star. All I really need to say is that not one, not two, but THREE bartenders have independently remembered me, and both where I like to sit and what I like to order. I can't name a single other restaurant where I've experienced hospitality like this, and it really stands out.Luckily, in my opinion the food really does match up to the charm, which is not something you might expect given how upscale the dining room is. There's no question that the restaurant caters to an older and classier crowd, and seems to host a lot of family gatherings and business meetings, but if you have a chance to stop in to the bar for a nice meal I highly recommend you do so.First of all, the 100 day (wet) aged prime rib-eye is a stunner, featuring 18 oz of meat from Brandt farms for $60 (previously $59). I tend to be quite disappointed with wet aging, but this is probably one of the finest examples of the technique I've ever eaten. The flavor of the steak is robust and complex, and I promise you won't be disappointed. I've compared it myself to their own dry-aged prime NY strip and I vastly prefer the ribeye, although your mileage may vary. That said, I wouldn't recommend ordering this cooked anything beyond medium rare (Grill 23 is also one of the only places that can properly do a rare plus, which would be my recommendation) as you'll lose a good amount of both flavor and texture.The bar burger itself is also a success in my opinion. It seems the blend itself may change with the season, but when I ordered it there was American Wagyu in the blend, along with a layer of thick-cut bacon and a really fantastic remoulade. It honestly took me by surprise, and the herb & parmesan fries it comes with are also delicious. I was tempted to call it the best burger I've had in Boston, but I have to try again before making sure.If I wanted to have a classic meal in town, perhaps something that would satisfy the whole family, Grill 23 would be at the top of my list. Sometimes tradition tends to outweigh culinary excitement, but Grill 23 is the rare exception, where memorable service and delicious food go hand in hand.> My husband and I went on a 'Steak Tour' in 2018, trying to find the best steak in Boston. We ended up finding the best place, and this is it! We've been back about 20 times since then, and it may have saved our marriage more than once. Since Yelp has a 5000 character limit, please see the photos for a full review of all the dishes that we have tried (about 10,000 characters!). We typically get and share two appetizers, one entree, one or two sides and dessert. We almost never get to try the non-steak entrees as we come here when we crave steak (and by steak, we mean specifically their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye""). But for those who don't want to read:TL/DR: Everything is good but their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye"" is the BEST steak in Boston.> The least expensive entree at Grill 23 & Bar is their vegetarian option - Spring Mushrooms & Wheat Berries $29 arugula, parmesan, citrus.  For entrees with animal protein, it was their Steak Frites $33.  A la carte pricing starts at $36 (swordfish steak 10 oz) and $38 (twin filets 8 oz), while side dishes to accompany them ranged from $12 (for their mashed potatoes and heirloom carrots) to $16 (stuffed mushrooms).  Thus it took Dine Out Boston (aka Restaurant Week, aka RW) to lure me in through their doors.Just as I was about to sit down, I noticed that water had dripped on to my seat.  They quickly wiped it up and apologized.  A bread basket with an assortment from red speckled flatbread to twin fluffy rolls, with squares of focaccia, and sliced brown bread of sorts tucked in.  The butter was soft and spreadable.  My personal favorite were the sweet rolls.Their $38 3 course Dine Out menu was printed right on the bottom of that day's single sheet menu.  I had no trouble making my choices:CORN CHOWDERwith roasted peppers & charred cornBRANDT FLAT IRON STEAKduck fat poached potatoes, parmesan creamed kale LEMON CURD TARTwith blueberry preserves, malted meringuesThough I also got to sample my DC's choices which differed from mine (we all picked the steak as our entree):CLAM & GREEN ONION FRITTERSwith bacon remoulade, friseeBROWNIE SUNDAEwith raspberry swirl ice cream, white chocolate puffed riceOf the appetizers, I felt mine to be the better pick, as the fritters were soft and not very meaty.  We all ordered our steak to be medium rare, but the results ranged a bit more than to be expected.  One friend's steak was a bit thinner, and so that might have been a reason for her steak to be closer to medium than the rest, however it was still not ideal.  The potatoes were buttery, and the creamed kale a nice touch.  Both desserts were well enjoyed, and we each felt we made the better choice.  A sweet ending to an enjoyable meal.We wondered if this would be one of those classy establishments which would have those cool crumb scrapers.  Well, definitely not after the first course, however, the bus boy was impressive as he quickly and professionally cleared our table of appetizer plates in one trip, while playing plate Tetris.  Later when he was about to set down the utensils for the dessert course, out came the scraper!The longest wait was for dessert.  Otherwise the timing was satisfactory.$21 valet parking.  Individual gendered bathrooms.  Noisier a space than I like prefer.  I wonder if it might have been more quiet upstairs.","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

Music was very entertaining and the atmosphere was inviting to have a good time. The only thing I have to say is that while guests are waiting to be seated since the place is too small there was really not an area were we could hang were we didn't feel like a bother to the waiting staff. I also thought of some of the appetizers a bit pricey for the portions. (Empanadas, tasty but is just one small empanada cut in half). We asked for water and they never brought us, but they were as attentive as they could.> To be fair, I've only been here for taco Tuesday but it's not the best in town. On Tuesday's their tacos are half price ($2.50), but this excludes some of their best selections so be sure to ask before you order!The chips and salsa have increased in price, and I always find it a little off putting when you have to pay for them to begin with, but they're worth it. Salsa is fresh and authentic.My go to's are the chicken, fried fish, and shredded beef Lorenza tacos. They're not always consistent as the chefs may rotate, but you get a good bang for your buck. My favorite is the Lorenza, but beware it's excluded from the Tuesday deal.But the churros are an ABSOLUTE MUST. They're my favorite in the city thus far, and I've had plenty. They're fat and crispy on the outside but thick enough that they're still soft and squishy on the inside. I hate it when they're too thin and fried to a crisp but these are perfection!> From being a transplant to Boston from San Diego, I have high expectations for good Mexican food. I can say that this place didn't disappoint. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing. There's a few tables outside for warm days. I got chicken enchiladas a mix of rojo & verde and they were amazing paired with a Hibiscus margarita which were both amazing. I can't wait to go back> I have both eaten in and ordered from El Centro. Both times I got a combination of different tacos. All of them were delicious. I have also tried the margarita and it was pretty delicious. Really recommend to anyone looking for Mexican food in the South End!> By far the best & most authentic mexican food in Boston. The plates here are to die for & so are the margaritas. Cant go wrong with tacos, toastada, or one of the specials. The carnitas verde was expecially good. FYi no reservations here!","4, 4, 5, 5, 5"

The rigatoni is big and doughy, soaking in the flavor of the ragu nicely. Ziti alla Amatriciana: Tasted pretty average, not as impressed with this one. North End pastas have all been home runs for me, so maybe it's just harder to compete, but this pasta didn't taste special at all to me. It was good by all means, but not worth $22... you can get much better for this price.As for service, there were a lot of waiters talking amongst themselves in the corner and not really paying attention to when we needed something.> Not awful, but overrated for the North End. Asked to add spinach to a dish and they said no. Waiter didn't ask to add cheese or ask if we wanted dessert (normal interactions). Granted it was Valentine's Day, but felt neglected.Chicken parm and meatballs tasted like reheated prepped meals - cold and chewy.Was so excited for this meal but unlikely I return.> Came here because the restaurant we wanted to go was full, and we didn't want to wait an hour.The service wasn't bad. Food didn't taste so good, though. Very salty. Wife and I developed mild laryngitis after the meal. Gulped down large quantities of water due to the heavy dosage of salt used in the food.The place was pricey too. $22 for a plate of ragu. After I finished my dish, I was still hungry, so I ate bread. This is a restaurant where tourists and visitors are ""slaughtered"", so why should one expect so much? Fooled me once, I guess. Won't be coming here again.> What a mediocre place. I'm utterly disappointed. This was in the center of the little Italy and one of the most popular restaurants in the area. I came with very high expectations and left with great disappointment. The dishes were really mediocre. You can tell the spaghetti was cooked without dipping back in the cold water before served so it lacked the needed texture. The dishes were priced higher as expected but it didn't come with the expected quality. I ordered the shrimp appetizer for $16, which came with 3 shrimps. While the waitress came asking how the dishes were, we replied as honestly and told her they were just ok. She then proceeded as she heard nothing and left. It was a busy Saturday night and they crammed the space with as many seatings as possible. So crammed that every times people past by, they would have to turn sideways or they pumped into you. The entire dining experience was horrible and I wouldn't want to recommend this place to my friends for sure.> Amazing Italian restaurant in North End Boston! Chefs and waiters are mostly Italian and they serve real Italian pasta. They have a really nice wine bar and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic. I tried Mom's Lasagna della Casa and Ravioli con Aragosta. Both were delicious but the sauce of the ravioli was just something else. At the end I was just dipping bread into the sauce. It was that good lol. Highly recommended restaurant!!","4, 2, 2, 1, 5"

Unfortunately we found that only 5/10 (roughly) tacos were actually discounted and the discount was only about $1 off each taco. With that said, tacos were very flavorful. I got the Carnitas Tacos which were filled with flavor. Haley got guacamole tacos which she enjoyed. We started with chips and guacamole which were good as well. For drinks, we both got margaritas. Mine was on the heavy side, didn't care too much for it (seeing that it was $11 was a downside as well). Overall, been to this restaurant multiple times and will go back. Next time, probably just stick with (and recommend) the beer.> 3.5 rating - Had dinner plans for my belated birthday with my best friend and stumbled upon this place after I found out my original pick was closed this week.  I was excited to try something new after deciding to go here as the next option because who doesn't love tacos?Walked into a beautiful restaurant with pretty hanging lights, a vibrant crowd, music and lots of smiling faces.  Large bar set up in the middle with tables on the sides and front.  Table for 2 was quick and easy at close to 7pm.Things you should know that I didn't..-If you go as a party of 2, go as a date because you will get squeezed inbetween first dates and overhear life introductions for the entire duration.  Seating is far enough for personal space but you can't unhear things either haha-Tuesdays is 1/2 price tacos.  Didn't realize until we saw a tiny slip of paper on the table to order oysters.  Check out the info and ask questions to get the scoop.  The scoop doesn't come to you.-If you don't drink, you have no reason to come.  Drive bys happen often here.  I wish I could have several shots of tequila and rack up a tab for you dear but I am breastfeeding an infant.  I only have 2 hours to snack for dinner, catch up with my best friend about life stuff, including life as a new mother of 2 with no time to herself, and run home to my husband who is watching 2 kiddos and waiting for me.. I am leaving soon right after this story............-The oysters were yum.  Try some.-I liked the baja fish taco the best.  Fried chicken was delish too.  -Fried chicken taco is spicy.  Don't say I didn't warn you.Overall, I recommend checking it out if you are in the area and want a drink and snack.  I need to get out more.  Maybe I picked the wrong spot and night out.> Loco deserves the hype it receives for being a great food and drink destination in an otherwise lacking part of Boston. The tacos are bomb, the oysters are delicious, and the margaritas have been solid. They also do chips and guac right, with healthy portions of each to share (one order filled two of us up comfortably). And, while it's not cheap, the menu won't break the bank, so it's a good option for a weekend or after work meal.So why four stars? The NOISE. It's so incredibly loud inside this restaurant. Add live music to the fray on the weekends, and you can barely hear the person across the table from you. I love the space, but wish they'd do more to separate the more energetic bar area from the sit-down diners.> Loco is a trendy taco joint serving up bites and drinks to the young professional crowd in Southie. If you walk in after work, or on weekends, you're likely to find a crowded establishment with well-dressed patrons set to the backdrop of twinkly lights, a wrap-around bar, wooden accents, and an oyster bar! I decided to be adventurous and order their coconut margarita. It had a coconut flake rim and was sweet and creamy. We also got chips and guac, which were solid but a little overpriced ($11). But, oh WOW. I ordered a veggie quesadilla with chicken added and it was probably the best quesadilla I've ever had. Flavor. Explosion. For those sour beer lovers out there, the Two Roads Lime Gose was also notable.","5, 4, 3, 4, 5"

But compared to its competition here in Boston, it earns its hype. The tortillas are soft, and they give lots of meat (a necessity to be great imo). I've also had the burritos here, which are small compared to my West coast burritos. Especially at the price point. However, I do love love love the tortas. Pretty hefty portion, and super tasty. I got it with the chorizo con papas, yummmm. I'm definitely coming back for more of these. I saw that they had breakfast foods too! Something to keep an eye out for as well.> After an amazing tour at the Samuel Adams brewery, we were hungry. Chilacates was just around the corner and was the perfect food after a day of drinking. It's a small place with not much seating available. There's just a bar area with stools. Not great for crowd, but great for a small group. I got their three taco plate. You only get one choice of meat. I made the mistake of thinking I could do more. When I got my food I realize why I couldn't do multiple meats. The tacos came deconstructed and you would basically need to make it yourself. The tortilla was a bit thicker than I thought it would be as well. The carnitas was good. Very flavorful. The side of pineapple salsa went amazing with it all. The taste of sweet and savory...delicious. The rice was good, but the beans wasn't my favorite. It was lacking some flavor. Love this place.> Great, fresh tacos. Not quite LA, but we're not in LA! I love getting the lengua (tongue), fish, and al pastor tacos. The horchata is really refreshing and tasty as well.","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"

Regarding the food, it was totally bland and no flavors, so not the kind that I would like. Either the food was tasteless and bland or its just my taste that makes authentic Ethiopian food unsuitable for me. I do not have much experience with ethiopian food so I cannot comment on this but probably this was the first and last time I am visiting this place.> ***To my knowledge, this is currently one of only three legal BYOBs within Boston city limits.***A tiny ~25 seat restaurant hidden on a busy block of other restaurants and businesses in Jamaica Plain.  But well worth seeking out for eat-with-your-fingers, tasty, filling and inexpensive Ethiopian cuisine that goes well with a variety of wines or beers.And I'm sure they'll give you a fork if you insist, but what's the fun in that? The spartan interior features a sink in back where you can wash your hands before eating with your fingers.  This is of course done with the traditional spongy injera flatbread made from teff grain, which you break into pieces so you can scoop up various vegetable and meat stews (lamb, beef, chicken, never any pork no matter your religion in Ethiopia).  Apparently it is traditional to do this with your right hand only (sorry lefties lol).We started with a couple of the spinach-stuffed sambosa (sambusa?), which were very much like the ubiquitous deep-fried spanakopita triangles you see at Greek restaurants and did not seem very authentic from what I can read online.  But tasty.  Also available with lentil (and possibly meat?) fillings.We followed this up with a meat and vegetable combination plate (or you can order individual dishes), which can be customized for any number of people to share and arrives on top of several large injera (more injera on a side plate to rip up).  Each meat and veggie was delicious, but very different from each other (a pleasant surprise), particularly the modestly spicy chicken stew, which was almost American BBQ in flavor and featured a couple of legs as well as pulled meat.  Our combo featured all 6 of the available vegetable dishes, the 1 chicken, 1 of the 5 beef and 1 of 2 lamb dishes, plus a salad.  With so many vegetable dishes on the menu, this would probably be a good restaurant for vegetarians, and they offer a vegetable combo plate as well.Ethiopian meat dishes are traditionally spicy, and can be extremely spicy.  But since this is a BYOB, don't worry, none of the dishes were spicy enough to be wine destroying or requiring only the traditional spicy food wines like Riesling or Gewürztraminer.  We went with an Italianate orange wine from Pennsylvania (my favorite wine from the East Coast) and a Cali cabernet, both of which worked well.  Bring your own if you want to use real wine stems as they just have tumblers.2011 Va La Vineyards La Prima Donna2014 Daou Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon Paso RoblesThey also serve traditional, made at the table Ethiopian coffee, which smelled wonderful, although we didn't try it.No dessert offered.Service was friendly and well-meaning, but we did have to ask for explanations when they were not forthcoming.  $51 + tax for a filling meal for 3 people. And the free parking on the street was fairly easy at 5:30PM on a Saturday.  Although small, at no time during our visit was the restaurant more than half full (we had a phone reservation, but you probably don't need one unless you have more than 4 people so they can pull some tables together).  They also have a couple of traditional mesob woven round wicker basket tables, although the seating around them didn't look as comfortable.MORE ABOUT BYOB:If you are interested, I have created a Yelp ""Collection"" of legal BYOBs in the Boston area (I define Boston pretty liberally lol):yelp.com/collection/RL6T…In case you don't know, Boston's rules for byob are as follows:Permitted Types/Sizes of Alcohol:A.

Plus the menu looked more appetizing and had more variety than the other steakhouses I was comparing it to (the Japanese dishes caught my eye). The ambience there is nice and the decor is very classy. We ordered the mooo side flight, Japanese wagyu beef, lobster mac and cheese, and creme brulee for dessert. Oddly enough, even though we ordered everything before the table of five next to us, they received their steaks before us and we waited a decent amount of time after we finished our appetizers (around an extra twenty five minutes). Not only this, but on two occasions when I wanted to ask the waiter for something, it was hard to catch his attention. It also felt weird to try to loudly call our waiter over. Thus, I felt the service was lacking.Now onto the food..The wagyu beef dumplings were okay, but not the best I've had. I would not pay over $20 again for four measly dumplings that tasted worse than the affordable homemade dumplings in Chinatown. The mooo side flight was delicious. The truffle fries were crispy. The mashed potatoes were creamy. The creamed spinach wasn't anything to rave about. The lobster mac and cheese was very cheesy and flavorful. They definitely skimped out on the lobster though because there were barely any pieces in it. The steaks were on the drier side and weren't very flavorful. The creme brulee was the tiniest size I have ever seen. The only food I'd like to rave about there is their complimentary chocolate marshmallows with a cookie/cracker inside. It was honestly the best way to end the mediocre meal. It was ironic how the complimentary dessert was the best tasting item there.Overall, I've had better food at better steakhouses (aka Ruth Chris) for better prices. Props to them for making someone's birthday feel special though (besides the fact that there is no complimentary birthday dessert)! They even put my boyfriend's name on his menu.> Fancy steak house but come as you are....what a great place. Excellent spot. ...on the outside looking in looks like a pretty posh place and a little uptight....but then you come in and its a fantastic cool lil spot. My experience is at the bar where I mealed with two of my guys. .. had an outstanding bartender Frankie the girl with the boys name ....she was really awesome and gave some great suggestions for drinks and food. Top shelf liquor of all brands and outstanding cuts of steak....what more can you ask for... between the 3 of us...we had the Creekstone Dry Aged Ribeye, the 22 oz Delmonico, and the Pepper Crusted Prime Sirloin....the Waygu Beef Dumplings were amazing and the Bone Marrow was outstanding. Came with great bread, crushed garlic and red wine reduction sauce....Boom....right out of the park. Sit at the bar where your drinks and food come out fast....thats my suggestion...and you will be 100% satisfied. If your lucky Frankie will be your bartender..... dont stop what your doing Mooo , you got a great thing going.#BuddhaReview> This is a great place to go if you're looking for a nice dinner spot for a date or even to go out for a nice dinner with your family. We came here with my boyfriend's family and it was pretty quiet and well lit for the parents to enjoy. We ordered:App: escargotSides: mushrooms, creamed spinach, and brussel sproutsMain dish: wagyu steak Dessert: pumpkin cheesecakeThe worst part of the meal was the brussel sprouts. It was just ok - not very crispy or flavorful. However everything else was pretty darn good. The mushroom side was actually one of my favorite dishes - it had a lot of good flavors going on and the mushrooms were cooked really well. The creamed spinach as probably one of the best creamed spinach I've had. The escargot had a really good sauce that I kept going back for with more bread. The wagyu steak was really good too but a bit of a disappointment. I thought it'd be more tender and a ""melt in your mouth"" sensation, but actually was more like a regular steak. The flavors were still good, but maybe not worth $90. The pumpkin cheesecake was super thick and the spices weren't overpowering either. I originally wanted the apple tart but this was a good alternative as well. Next time, I'll have to try the apple tart.> The awesome: 1- location at XV Beacon2- romantic interior 3- Creekstone certified halal organic high end steaks4- complimentary bread. The average: The steak was on the dry lackluster side. This is a premium Creekstone piece! The char should be perfect. The seasoning must be perfect. Broccoli and pine nuts side dish was underwhelming. A secret to make good pignoli  trigger their mild yet incredible flavor is to toast them in olive oil and some salt. The bad: Lobster Mac and cheese. It was watery. More on al dente side. A big failure. I told the waitress. She took it off the bill and made notes to the chef. She was nice.  Expected more. 3 stars.","5, 3, 5, 4, 3"

First off, the inside is wonderful, there are flowers and wine bottles, and the glasses are very thin and elegant. We came here for a team outing of wine and trivia and everyone loved it! There was beer for the beer people and wine tasting for the rest of us. The charcuterie was delicious, as were the sliders and smoked salmon bites. The trivia was very casual, with a lot of time for chatter between rounds, and the blind wine tasting portion was a great touch.> Cute and chic wine bar right in downtown. The staff are all super friendly and give great recommendations. They have a huge selection of wine and delicious charcuteries and small plates. It is a perfect spot to host events or attend one of their special wine tasting events. A couple of my friends have rented out the whole space for a celebration and the space is the perfect size to accommodate a group but still keep the event intimate. It is definitely worth checking out!> I was happy to stumble upon this lovely wine bar on a Saturday afternoon.  The inside was just gorgeous, classy, but with enough light and big, open spaces.  It would be great for a date night or a bigger group.The wine selection by the glass was great.  I tried something Croatian, and I loved it.  I understand they also have a wine shop across the street if you want bottles to take home.  I was the last customer there, and the owner was a lovely person and extremely knowledgeable.  Highly recommended; support your local businesses!> This little upscale wine bar is not on the up and up for its mystery wine tasting. We came in and I guessed the Red Cabernet blend. The waitress looked shocked and offered a us a free glass. My friend was not to be deterred and asked for the bottle of wine. She then said it's across the street at the store, we'd have to go get it. No I think not! So she went but she claimed the bottle was sold out. It's buyer beware on the mystery tasting. You need to guess the grape and it doesn't have to be a bottle on their menu. The fact she didn't want to give us a bottle we rightfully won is just dishonest and fraudulent!The food was actually really good if you want to pay outrageous prices for a tray of sliced meat and cheese. The waitress did bring gluten free crackers after first saying they ran out. We won't return but so glad my wine tasting experiences won me a sweet and just reward.> Located at 101 Summer St. near South Station and Downtown Crossing, Taste Wine Bar & Cafe's grand opening was on Aug. 21, 2017. I got a sneak preview thanks to my friend Kerri, who has gotten to know the owner through their sister store, Common Vines Wine Shop. With clean white design, an exposed brick wall, and trendy lighting, it's an Instagrammer's dream. Taste offers an extensive wine-by-the-glass menu, a delectable small plates selection and wine tasting seminars. They describe themselves as ""an urban tasting room with education, a place for people who enjoy wine, beer and cheese to hang out.""During a preview event of this Boston bar last week, I sampled things like a mushroom and brie toast, an avocado and ricotta toast, a fig and blue cheese flatbread, and Korean meatballs. The wine offerings were extensive and all unique and interesting (without being too obscure). My favorite of the evening was a sparkling red wine, Lini Rosso Lambrusco. Served chilled, it was a welcome surprise. I ended the night by buying a bottle at the wine shop.To this day, this is one of my favorite bars in Boston.

While walking the freedom trail, we saw a cut in the side and found it. It was very tick away but in a great area. I ordered the chicken parmigiana pasta and garlic bread and I was blown away at how delicious it was! The portions are good so you'll be full but not stuffed where you'll feel sluggish.Overall 5/5 and enjoyed the family business vibes it gives.> I love grabbing lunch here. This cafe is hidden down an alley.Everything that I have ordered here has always been delicious and it feels like home cooking. The chicken Caesar salad is my go to since I try to be healthy and it just doesn't taste like a typical chicken Caesar salad. I think they make their dressing. The romaine lettuce is crunchy and dry (some places the lettuce is wet as if they washed it but didn't dry them which makes everything soggy). The grilled chicken is seasoned well and the croutons are herb-y and crunchy. My bf likes to get the chicken broccoli ziti here with olive oil/garlic sauce and it's really good. Though recently, he said the broccoli had a weird metallic after taste. I tried it. It was a little strange but nothing that seems too alarming. Broccoli looked fresh and was crunchy.This is a great place for lunch. There are plenty of tables and chairs. It's actually quite a big space and they could have more chairs and tables. I see people order to go often as well.> This place is a quick Italian eatery, perfect for lunch or quick meal. I have come here twice for lunch, and both times I got the chicken parm panini ($7.99), which I would recommend. The portion was large for what you pay for, and the food is delicious. The chicken parm seemed like it was made fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. I have eaten there and taken it to go, and both times it was great. I will be back again!> Two slices of pizza to go for lunch today, they were hot and ready and very inexpensive. One with mushrooms and onions and peppers, one with barbecue chicken. Huge slices and very well topped. Delicious. I'll know for next time that one is enough.> Everyone in here is nice. I go for lunch often and they know my name.

I came here for a spontaneous trip for my birthday. We came here for authentic New England clam chowder and when I researched for a place, this place popped up. The place is by the water so I can only imagine how this place looks and how crowded it would get over the summer. The view is amazing, the location is amazing and the place is clean. We had the New England clam chowder, oyster, New England IPA beer, lobster mac and cheese, and the lobster roll (Traditional). I have had oysters before but this was so fresh, I felt like the little mermaid. The New England clam chowder... was so good! My lobster roll and fries were the perfect combination with that refreshing beer. And the lobster mac and cheese, just with one bite, I died, came back to life and fell in love for the first time. Everything was so fresh and just perfect. I also had the Boston creme pie for dessert and let me tell you, it was the perfect ending to the evening and with all the food I had. I highly recommend this place to any seafood and foodie lovers. You must add this to your bucket list! If I ever come back to Boston, I will make my way over and get everything else!> I'm feeling so so about this establishment and think of it more like a tourist trap in Boston's waterfront area. The restaurant is well situated around Boston piers, so they will always get customers who are most tourists wandering around the area to stop by for a meal.My friend and I were in the area and we ended up getting fried seafood mix, sweet potato fries and a cup of chowder. The food was just so so. Nothing stood out in my mind and nothing really spectacular that would make me want to return (except if my companion would want to go there).Service was a bit lacking. We had a hard tine getting our server's attention...and our table (which was shared with another party) was not really clean before we took our seats and once the other party whom we had to share a table with left.Overall, just a so so experience. I'm thinking there may be other places that I would want to explore in Boston if i ever thought of a meal of chowder, seafood and/or lobsters again.> Decent seafood spot right on the water. They have a wood-burning stove that is true to its name. I think some of our party members were sweating. Super cozy atmosphere that compensates for classic Boston service -- brisk and indifferent. We had shrimp, mussels, oysters, calamari, lobster, lobster rolls, you name it. The oysters stood out, honestly. The lobster rolls were ok. I got mine 'naked' and it might have been a bit too naked and a bit too chewy. The drinks were ok. Heavy on the sugar, perhaps premixed? The bill was enough to make a grown man cry. That's seafood for ya, though!> Busy place out on the water.   Very, very busy.   Had to wait for a while to get a seat, finally just snagged a high top outside by the bar.  Had to go up to the bar to order drinks and food.  All I can really Yelp about was the food as we kind of served ourselves.  We ordered the naked lobster rolls.  Kind of over the mayo sauce so we thought this would be a good idea...and it was.   Lobster cooked perfectly.  Delicious little lunch.   Prices on par with just about every place in town.   I would have liked to go back when they weren't as busy.   The weekday lunch time is not a good time if you are visiting from out of town.  Way too busy.  Next time we will definitely go outside of lunch time to get the true experience of the restaurant.   The food was delicious, so I do give them that.  I'd try it again for sure.> Let's start off by saying that our food was just ok. Steamers came out cold and full of sand. Bisque was somewhat good. Lobster roll had a little too much bread, but a decent helping of lobster. Seemed understaffed, couldn't seat our group together when there was open tables. Had to sit at high tops and order from the bar. We were recommend to come here by numerous people. We'll be back again, let's hope it's better next time.","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Greg?) was absolutely top notch.   He asked us what time was curtain and assured us he would pace our meal in time so that we wouldn't feel rushed - and that he did.    The cocktail menu looked delicious, one person in our party had the spicy pomegranate margarita - she loved.  Another asked for a custom old fashioned, made perfectly.   We had the calamari for an appetizer and then moved on to our entrees.  Scallops, rack of lamb, and filets.   All delicious and perfectly portioned.  Our waiter surprised our birthday guy with a delicious chocolate soufflé and fresh berries with ice cream.   All in all a wonderful, we would definitely go again.> I have been here strictly for drinks with some ladies and it's a decent spot. We sat at the bar where we overlooked the spacious restaurant - it had some places to mingle, but otherwise you sat in pockets of areas. I was pleased with my cocktail but unfortunately, this place wasn't that memorable to me. Maybe if I tried it for their brunch or meal options, but it just seemed like a well decorated but ordinary bar to me.> I am not someone who goes to Brunch but t wasn't late enough for lunch so we stopped in at Precinct for brunch, selecting it for the outdoor seating.I am probably a Brunch person now.  I noticed the various Eggs Benedict options and asked our waiter if he had tried them.  He responded that they were all great but today would go with the pork belly Eggs Benedict.  It was absolute perfection.  I do not live in the area but I definitely want to go back. The pork was perfectly cooked as was the egg.  And they serve it on biscuits.  This is served with fresh fruit and potatoes.  I didn't even need the potatoes.  We had Bloody Mary's with our meal.  They were nothing special but good.Nice place all around.  It is below street level which offers more privacy.  I am very hungry now after writing this...> We came here for breakfast coz were craving for pancakes.We order pancakes together with the Huevos Rancheros,Its corn tortilla with feta cheese potatoes and red beans, it comes with chorizo too- but we told the waiter to remove the chorizo. The food arrived for quite a long time, like 20mins.Then the food arrived, the Huevos food arrived with chorizo, we told the waiter that we ordered without it, he took it back and to our surprise the food came back after 2mins.We suspect that he just scraped down the minced chorizo, and voila! We are correct! So the food  tasted chorizo, we almost did not touch it.The pancake with berries and banana was good. (At least we have something to share for breakfast)> Attentive servers, pricey drinks and sterile atmosphere akin to what you'll find at many other high end hotels. The venue's close proximity to the John Hancock performing arts center affords convenience for a drink after a show when it's cold outside.  What Precinct lacks is any semblance of a cool vibe; it is what it is.","5, 3, 5, 3, 3"

It wasn't crowded, so we easily found seats. I ordered the Downeast cider and hoisin chicken wings. The cider was a great balance of sweet and tart. It tasted really good! The hoisin wings were also really delicious, but they didn't really taste like hoisin sauce in my opinion. Either way, the platter came with around 6 wings and a ranch sauce. Overall, we had a great experience and would come back again.> On a recent Saturday night my ping-pong playing friend and I checked into Cheeky Monkey Brewing for the primary purpose of testing our skills.  We put in our name at the game table which also featured billiards and a type of skeet ball. After less than 5 mins of waiting, our table was ready.  Since we brought our own paddles, we only needed the classic orange ball.  The orange actually helped it stand out in the dim bar lighting and as it occasionally rolled around on the floor between other ping-pong games and billiard participants.  The table was in good shape with just a few beverage rings from prior players who used the table to rest their adult beverages.  The only complaints were that the lights were too low and occasionally interfered with the flight of the ball (on legitimate volleys with top spin).  The lights were higher than the billiard table lights, but still too low for ping-pong.  The fee to play was more expensive than it should be, but with the rare amount of tables available in the area unless you book a probate suite at GameOn or a private room at Jillian's, it was worth it.  We played for 3+ hours and the table was $50 covering our rental time. The other complaint was the wait staff.  Grossly understaffed and not very attentive at all.  In 3+ hours I was able to get the waiter in our area attention twice.  And rest assured, I tipped him very well with our first order in an attempt to get his attention throughout the evening.  On the second trip it took well over 30 mins to get a drink delivered.  The bar was quite busy and it was too far away from the tables.  So paying for the table while you wait in line is not a good financial decision either.  What I will do next time is double order and set my expectations far lower on the service end.  With better service alone, Cheeky Monkey would have earned 4 stars for bringing a unique game offering to the adult beverage arena.> This place was a spontaneous gem!! Went to go see The Roots at House of Blues in Boston and we were going to head somewhere for dinner until we walked by Cheeky Monkey!  We decided to check out the menu and not only was the menu perfect for a group of girls with varying taste buds...but as we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the chill vibes including an entire gigantic back lounge area with couches, pool tables, shuffle board tables, ping pong tables, fireplaces....I mean what more can you ask for?!Food and drinks were really good too. I liked the peppers for apps and chicken tacos for my entree. The girls liked their food and drinks too. We played pool and shuffle board since we had some time to kill before the concert. You can order food and drinks from that area too ;) Highly recommend if you are in Boston and a MUST if you are going to House of Blues for a concert or show.> Great beer and good appetizer! We stopped in on our way to a movie and wanted a quick drink and an appetizer. We were staying nearby and wanted to try out several places along side Fenway Park. We stopped in and sat at the bar. We ordered two of their IPAs. The beer was hoppy but had a great citrus flavor too. Just the way I love my IPAs. We also ordered the cajun poutine which was really good. It needed a kick of something to really put it over the edge of being great. The fries were cooked perfectly and the flavors were good. The whole vibe of the place is great! Definitely stop in for a great beer and food.> Note to self, just because it says brewery and you are drinking your way through Boston, doesn't mean you should stop in. We left the Landsdowne pub and after we were rejected by one of our favorite bars due to a private event - Looking at you Bleacher Bar, we ended up here. It's a Hard Rock Cafe impression of a brewery with mediocre beer and mediocre food. The Harambe's Ghost, while a great name for a beer, fell flat as a hop bomb that a double ipa should be. The deviled eggs sounded great but when we got them, were nothing out of the ordinary and had an odd texture, chewier than expected. The wings and the calamari weren't much better. The service was pretty good, but didn't make up for the other items or the ambiance as a whole. If you don't like craft beer and you're looking for fried food to shove in your face after drinking all day, this is your place. The vibe was just much to chain restaurantish for my liking.","4, 3, 5, 5, 3"

They greet you like you're their long lost friend, and like they're super happy that you've come to visit. My mum and I got takeout after a long day of moving, and then we decided to sit outside in their little porch area, the waitress noticed, and she brought out plates, water, napkins, and silverware. It was a little thing that wasn't necessary, but it was much appreciated. Last time I visitied, I got cannolis too, and they were a delight. I highly recommend Ciao!

They are PACKED with lobster and offer a good amount more than the average lobster roll I've had in Boston. The sandwiches are delicious; the bread is lightly grilled and the lobster is not too heavily seasoned. I bought these to take to Chicago, and my parents and I thought they still tasted great after 15 or so hours in a cooler. I also bought a clam chowder, but I forgot that it wouldn't make it through security. Will definitely come back!Space inside the restaurant is very limited; there are tables outside (pretty much a takeout place in the winter).> It was actually my second tome checking this place out after one and a half year. Food here is consistently good and it amazed me even more this time. My boyfriend and I ordered a whole lobster, a cup of seafood chowder, and a lobster sandwich at the counter. Then we moved into a enclosed room with heater to stay away from the cold and waited for about 15 minutes before our good was served.Everything was amazing! I had the steamed lobster. For $16 dollars you can get a whole lobster freshly cooked and served with melted butter. The lobster was cooked perfectly and it even had eggs in the brain. It was a very good deal~ The seafood chowder is a must have. Instead of serving clam chowder, the restaurant made it to another level by adding other seafood in it such as scallop. The umami flavor was much stronger than clam chowder along and it was super creamy as well. Lobster sandwich. Nothing more I need to say. This is what the restaurant is famous for. That generous portion of lobster flesh; who can resist it? Lobster was very well seasoned and the bread was nicely toasted with coated butter. The only thing I don't like is that the lobster sandwich was served cold, or lukewarm. I am a warm lobster roll girl so I prefer the bread to be warm, especially in the cold winter. But still, it is a very good deal at this price.Highly recommend this place. Very fair price and delicious. I will say this is where the locals will go for lobsters (even though today I heard people speaking in Chinese, Korean and Japanese lol). Check it out when you are in Boston!> I just couldn't let summer end without another lobster roll. Stopped by Alive & Kicking last week with an out of town friend who demanded New England-style seafood. I heard good thing about this place and wanted to give it a try (to kill two birds or something like that). This place did not disappoint!Loved the lobster sandwich. Generous serving of lobster in the sandwich. Loved how I got more lobster than bread. Don't know how I can ever go back to eating it in a roll. The lobster bisque was flavorful and tasty. Could really tell it was made that day. The clam chowder didn't disappoint. Super fresh and a really-true-to-its-roots clam chowder. There's outdoor seating and a couple of off street parking spaces. They did have a smaller seating area in a makeshift shack. It was on the pricey side ($31 in all) and the soups were smaller portions than I would have liked for $6 plus bucks. Lobster sandwich was better value, even if the price is comparable or a little more than some places. You just get so much lobster! But hey, its a small business and I'm sure the taxes are high. Is it worth trekking out to this side of Cambridge to eat? Maybe not, but  I would definitely eat a lobster sandwich here again if I was close by.","5, 5, 5, 5, 4"

It's always busy, so if you are a part of more than 2, you should make a reservation. I went there early and sat at the bar. The bar manager is great, and super friendly and knowledgeable of the drinks. And he's got good selection of whiskys, and most of my go-to scotch and bourbon. The food was amazing! I love their pickles, Istanbul grape leaves, and octopus. Very tasty. Please get their cheesecake for dessert. That was the lightest and creamiest thing I ever had!> WhIle the atmosphere is charming, Moona suffers from a severe case of hubris. This place just can't compete with its neighbors of Oleana, Sarma, et al. The food is good but not worth a price tag of $50-60 a person (if one orders a drink). There are certainly better options in the Inman Square area where better eats and a more relaxed atmosphere can be found at a much lower price point.> Moona is a bit on the pricey side but, if you're looking for a nice date spot or a place to catch up with a close friend, this is a lovely choice. The ambiance is both intimate and lively, the cocktails are original and delicious, and the food is really well executed. I particularly loved the feta fritters, spicy potatoes, and the baba ghanoush. Extra points for delicious knafe.> (Note: this visit was earlier this year, so the items I tried on the menu may no longer be available on the current menu.)Moona is in Cambridge, located at Inman Square, just past the Somerville line.  Not quite my neck of the woods, so it took me a while to finally go here.I scored the parking spot right in front of Moona since I was just a few minutes late for our 6pm reservation, and parking opens up around here at 6pm according to the posted signs.They are a small place up two steps from the sidewalk, with a scattering of tables with nearly 20 seats and a line of stools by the bar.  Reservations are accepted.  For larger party reservations a credit card is requested.They'll take your jackets and give you a paper slip to exchange back for it later.  Given the tightness of the space, this is a nice convenience that they offer.Service was cheerful and pleasant.  Napkins are folded whenever they notice you have stepped away from the table.The menu is short with 10 Mezza (think tapas) and 4 Daily Meals (entrees; we were told they may be 3x a mezza).  It was suggested that we order 2-3 Mezzas per person.Tip - keep a menu, that way you can read and see the description of the dish after it arrives at the table.  I loved the glossary that was included in the menu!They started us off with some bread and flavored butter.  The bread was in small flat tender squares (zaatar bread according to another Yelp review).  The butter was terrific - a delicious date molasses honey butter the color of caramel.. Pan Seared Sea Scallops (beet, citrus, herbs) $14. Brussels Sprouts (tahini, barberries, pine nuts, coriander) $10. Octopus (fennel yogurt, lemon relish) $18. Daily Special - eggplant with poached tomatoes $9(?). Chicken Musakhan Rolls (sumac, pomegranate tahini) $12. Fattoush (greens, pear, shanklish, hazelnuts, lemon, pom molasses) $13. Dips, Pickles & Olives (hummus, zaalouk, labneh) $16 which is accompanied by light crisp pita chipsPhotos to be posted later will better show the portion size.  The two large scallops were beautifully seared, fat and juicy.  Brussels sprouts were terrific.  The octopus tenacle was plump and tender, and well cooked even to the tip.  Twin slices of eggplant were served alongside two skinless little tomato spheres.  The Chicken rolls arrived at a perfect count of 4 bundles for our party of 4, with a surprisingly tender wrapping around the meaty filling.  The Fattoush was a refreshing though sparse salad.  The dips were the fun ending as we dipped the chips into the various spreads.  The chips were nice and light, so we appreciated the willing refills.For your choice of sweet endings, there are two:Ice cream/Sorbet (Halawa, Sahlab, Pear Cardamom) $4Chocolate Tahini Tart $8 sour cherry, pistachioWe shared the tart and found it rich and chocolatey.A nice meal for not that little money, so a bit of a splurge or special occasion spot.A single private bathroom is located to the left, and it has a cool faucet.Noted at the bottom of their menu:20% Gratuity will be added to parties of 6 or more.3% Kitchen Service Fee will be added to every bill for our Kitchen Team> Our Moona experience was so beautiful. We came here for dinner tonight and I can't wait to come back. I had been here previously when Moona first opened for a private Yelp Elite event. The food was wonderful then and the food is still wonderful now. It was my husband first time here and he was blown away by the service and by the delicious food. We sat at the bar because even though most of the tables were empty they were reserved for upcoming reservations. I wish the bar seats had bigger backs but the bar itself was lovely, as was the bartender and the bar decor. Our bartender made the best drinks. Moona stocks their bar with bitters and other mixologist dreams. I was made two cocktails and was asked properly what my cocktail preferences were. Both drinks were right on the mark. My favorite was the Viva Maskita. We ordered:1.) Dips, Pickles and Olives - 4 stars - absolutely beautiful presentation and is served with a bowl of pita chips 2.) Feta & Currant Fritters - 5 stars 3.) Chicken Msakhan Rolls - 5 stars - must order item, taste as if a chicken shawarma and an egg roll had a baby Inman square is a bit in the middle of nowhere but definitely come here for a great time.

Never had to wait in line and bartenders were very attentive! However, within all of my experiences there, the latest is what I unfortunately have to write a bad review about. A group and I decided to go in and watch a game on a Sunday. We noticed a group of much older men ordering nonstop drinks for younger females. Ok, sure no biggie not our business. They became extremely assertive and acted as if they were above other patrons at the bar. They were rude to other people trying to order drinks and claimed they ""owned the place"".  They said seats at the bar during a busy time of day were theirs on reserve even though they, coincidentally, let the seats up to young women. If they were truly the owners they were extremely ignorant to other local bar attendees, not the way I would expect a man to run a business. Overhearing security, the crew started calling what seemed like aggressive claims against other bar patrons and caused a very chaotic scene which made many patrons, including myself and my party, feel uncomfortable. I was very unsettled about the inappropriateness in which everything was handled, I'm not surprised this place was supposed to close several times by now.> Been here twice and the food that I've had has always been lackluster.The appetizer i got was the brunch wings which are phenomenal and the jam that came with it was bomb!The main courses for brunch have been very weak in my opinion, always ""ok"" never good but the vibes here are good.If you want decent food with an awesome vibe, come!They have an outside patio an inside bar and a rooftop patio.On the rooftop there is cornhole, massive jenga, and just good vibes.Not the kinda place that plays hip hop> Nothing be amazing things to say. I highly recommend the roof top during the day so much fun and a lot of lawn games from connect four, Jenga and corn hole. On top of all that they had amazing live music.For food and  drinks I recommend the spicy margarita and nachos. I didn't get a chance to try but they also had truffle tots and buffalo cauliflower which are 2 of my favorite foods.> Wow this place is a Warehousey convert! Now there was a guy singing acoustic guitar upon entering. The place is filled with 20 something year olds I What's really cool is they managed to put a food truck as part of their kitchen where the dining area is. The place is loud loud loud. The acoustics of everybody's conversation is well heard here. It is a very lively place so if you want to socialize and hang out... this is a good place for you especially if you live around the area. There is a place for private parties too.The food is not bad.The brussell sprouts was great but doesn't have to have the cranberries added but the flavor was good. There was copper bowl that I highly recommend too. The wings were meh... could tell they were previously frozen but there was a feather stuck on my wings.... yuck. I pulled it out    and ate it still. ..hunger does that to you. I did bring it up to the server who was totally sweet so she brought it to her manager and they took the wings off and gave us 20% off of the bill. Extremely courteous and sweet that I gave her 48% tip. A good place to have a drink and have a some typical bites to eat he's kind of laid back and I see the fun good place for big party.","5, 1, 4, 3, 5"

Being a nitpick I thought the lettuce seemed ""wet"". Like when you wash it and don't spin or dry it. Quon was our server and service was excellent> Wow, what an absolute dumpster fire. Where to even begin...we were sat at 6:15. The restaurant was steadily busy but it was open enough that we were given multipleOptions for tables.  We finally received our drinks at 6:49 pm-- at that point we called the restaurant next door to check the wait because we took it as a sign of things to come. They were on a super long wait so we decided to tough it out. We asked for bread three times because we were starving...before it finally came, well after 7pm. The chorizo totcho appetizer which came out with our drinks at 6:49 was pretty decent but wasn't worth the 12 bucks we paid for a very small portion. Honestly the problem tonight came down to horrible front of house management coupled with understaffing.Your servers were working their ASSES off, stretched aimlessly across your restaurant running back and forth between asinine nonsensical sections. I saw them bussing their own tables, running glassware to dishwashers...helping out in the kitchen, all while you stood aimlessly at the kitchen window telling the chefs what you still needed. The chefs who were clearly understaffed were working fast and they clearly knew they were behind- the manager contributed NOTHING to the process. Roll up your sleeves- bus some tables- walk around and make sure tables have drinks and bread and give some hospitality. Have the common sense to stop seating tables and go on a wait. Do ANYTHING helpful. Halfway through the night some back of house manager showed up and got things in order...honestly the front of house manager just doesn't have what it takes they should put the other woman in charge. Direct your hostess to do some bussing- to check in with tables and run food and drinks- to offer people bread...do ANYTHING but what you did tonight.  Finally-at 7:45 our main entrees arrived. Two sandwiches, a burger, and a flatbread, my friend was rearranging his burger to actually be on the bun when the manager walked up and pulled his burger out from in front of him and said ""that's not yours I'll be back."" Never in my life have I seen such a thing! Let's try: sir we've brought you the wrong order, would you like to keep that one or would you like me to correct it? He had already cut into it for cripes sake. They brought him another more disappointing looking burger without a side and he just sent it back and asked them to cancel. We finally rolled out of there around 8:30 after being seated at 6:15. The food was a 3/5 but bad management and poor hosting knocked off two stars. Hats off to our server because she clearly did the best she could to keep moving...unlike her leadership. She should get herself a better gig because she's too good for that place.Their big apology to us was to give us a free app for the next time we're in. There will not be a next time!> Been in half a dozen times now. Only thing I'd honestly recommend is the wings which are passable at best.  Staff seems uninformed and poorly trained.  Management doesn't seem to care. Each time I've been there, dirty plates and glasses line the bar.  Food is uninspired and poorly executed.  Deal breaker for me was watching a server texting on his phone during service, then reaching into the fruit jar to grab a lemon to garnish someone's drink. Zero regard for public health at this place.  Definitely avoid if you have any sense of self-preservation> Just picked up my fish and chips to go, didn't look like  the picture I saw, so here's a more accurate PIC.  RIP OFF$20.00 after tip> We decided to try this spot .. and boy did we quickly regret our decision. At first glance, the place did not impress me with its ambiance (lack there of) or the decor. This should've been a red flag. We were seated at one of the bar high tables and waited a bit longer than we wanted to for the flustered server to greet us. Mind you, the restaurant was nearly empty. My boyfriend and I ordered drinks. I got a prosecco - they brought me a white wine. Ugh. After they brought me the correct drink, we then decided to order an app .. we ordered the Spanish dip and it was okay. A bit burnt but it did the trick. Then we got our entrees. The most depressing part of our experience .. my boyfriend ordered the chicken pesto and I got the shrimp and clam linguini. First bite into my linguini and I wanted to spit it out. Overpowered by lemon, tasteless and watery! The shrimp had absolutely no seasoning or flavor either and .. what clams?!?!Then I asked my boyfriend (who hates complaining) how his food was and he said it was alright. I tried it. And wow. Same thing. Bland. Tasteless. And he couldn't even eat the chicken because it didn't taste like anything or even tasted cooked really! I sent my food back and despite of being famished, I decided to not order anything else off the menu. My boyfriend ate a few more bites and just threw the towel down and stopped eating. We decided to order one more round of drinks instead. They comped my meal and the app. The server was nice, but definitely inexperienced which is not her fault. Also not her fault that she works at a crappy restaurant. I fully recommend people to avoid this place.","5, 1, 1, 1, 1"

We live in the neighborhood and come regularly for dinners, Mangia Monday when they do unlimited pasta and salad for $35, and we frequent brunch.  The bread and salad are always to die for, but that's just the start. The pasta and every entree I've ever had is amaaaaaazinggg. I had a fried chicken sandwich for breakfast. Who'd have though a fried chicken sandwich at an upscale Italian restaurant would be one of (if not the) best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. It's such a great atmosphere. Come as you are and be welcomed by a friendly, dedicated staff. I can't say enough good things.> I'd give a 2.5 here. The food had promise. My guess is that someone had a grand vision with this establishment. What is lacking here is a level of curation. The food has inspiration but poor execution The place needs some warmth and some more attention put into the experience. There are flavours in the mussels, but the bowl is not shallow enough to allow you to dredge the amazing bread into the sauce. Service was friendly but absolutely in need of refinement and guidance. I wanted to love this place but it just didn't hit the mark sadly. Note to the owner: window boxes, air plants, warmth... this is great real estate and you have a lovely idea here. Hand made pasta that delivers could go a long long way. You are close.> Solid Italian food with great homemade pasta! Very reasonable pricing I thought especially for the location and quality of the food. The atmosphere isn't very Italian-esque, but fits into the South End neighborhood. We had the arancini to start and had the paccheri Bolognese and spaghetti al granchio. The plates may not look filling but they'll definitely fill you up. But you'll find a way to make room for the tiramisu at the end. The pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauced for both dishes were delish. Loved the added mix of broccoli rabe in the Bolognese and the added crunch from the breadcrumbs. I was impartial to the tiramisu and don't know if it's quite worth the $10. Too much crunch from the added cacao nibs or chopped espresso beans. Def check the place out- it gives North End a run for their pasta.> We saw something about the chef on NECN and had to try it.  It has a warm and friendly atmosphere and the wait staff are very nice.  We shared delicious arancini appetizer.  My wife had the gnocchi and I had the bolognese.  We ate every drop!  Citrus cake for dessert ended a perfect meal!  Can't wait to go back!!!> My husband and I visited Mida on a rare Monday date night and partook in Mangia Mondays - all you can eat pasta (with a side of bread and salad) all night for $35!I think the deal is quite worth it, considering you can literally eat as much pasta as you want, and you have freedom to choose which dishes you'd like to try. The only stipulation is that everyone at the table must order the same dish at once, and there can be no doggie bags (but they don't care if you don't finish your dish). We went through the entire 5 courses (my husband had 2 of the courses twice, because he was still hungry). Really nothing stood out except the clam carbonara, and I wonder if that's because I like clams and carbonara. The other dishes, especially the gnocchi, were much to rich for my taste. The first course, runner's Torchio, was quite soggy; while the last two courses, Bucarini and a Paccheri dish, were also sauce-heavy and very rich, without being able to appreciate the pasta.Overall a good deal, and although the first dish took forever to come out the rest of the dishes came out in quicker succession, but I was not impressed with the pasta dishes themselves.","5, 2, 5, 5, 3"

BUT I've been multiple time and the food is always good. Drinks are fun and delish.Knocked a star :Marliave is like a little house, kinda like the last house on the left. Creeky and Creepy.Bathrooms upstairs weird vibes but okay you old.It also has always had some sort of weird stench in there, I've only sat at the bar and it just smells stale. Just faintly though, but noticeable. Drinks are delish and the patio is good for the warmer months.Bravo!> Been scouring for a decent Boston happy hour with oysters, and Marliave is the place to go. Their happy hour is daily from 4-6 pm (and 9-10 pm), complete with dollar oysters, dollar clams, and $2.25 cocktail shrimp.The oysters were amazing! We ordered a dozen to start, and then a half dozen more because they were so delicious. They came in three varieties: duxbury, spring creek, and pleasant bay, and arrived artfully arranged on a platter with the horseradish and cocktail sauce. Nothing like slurping fresh Boston oysters. Don't be fooled by the shrimp, though; while listed as a 'shrimp cocktail' on the menu, the $2.25 is indeed for a singular shrimp. More of a raw deal, if you catch my drift.We had our seafood with the bone shaker. We told the waitress that we wanted to split the cocktail, and she was nice enough to actually serve each half in a separate glass. Was a simple yet thoughtful gesture. The cocktail, a mix of prosecco, elderflower, and gin, was good but stronger than I expected: I'd wanted the flavor of the former two, but it was the latter that stood strongest.Pretty swanky place; we felt very classy sipping on our cocktails and delicately slurping our oysters. I still can't believe oysters that good only cost a dollar each. The drinks weren't discounted during happy hour, but the oysters more than made up for that fact. This will be my go-to oyster spot in Boston for sure!> My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week, and boy, lemme say this is the most disappointing meal I've had in my life. (So maybe don't come during restaurant week?)The food was very unseasoned, so if you think milk is a little spicy, this is the place for you. I couldn't even taste salt nor pepper.The breakdown:Truffle Mac & Cheese : This had 0 truffle taste, but the cheese was ok.French Onion Soup : Pretty darn good, the 1 star is coming from this.Shrimp Scampi : Noodles and shrimp cooked perfectly, but virtually no flavor in the sauce, so you're eating boiled noodles and shrimpDuck Confit : All I tasted was the baked beans. No seasoning, though the texture was quite nice. Duck from Chinatown butchers are more flavorful for 5$ maybe add some greens? Veggies to cut how heavy the dish is????!!Both desserts (truffles & cheese plate) are good.However, the cocktails are unique and delicious. This is where the only other star is coming from.> I'd definitely recommend checking out their happy hour. The atmosphere was nice, the service was great, and the seafood was good (as far as I can tell!). They also have great happy hour deals. Decor was cute too, it was very quaint. The only problem we had was locating the entrance. See pics below if you need help. I came here for happy hour with my friend for a snack before dinner. They have $1 oysters and clams. And $2.5 cocktail shrimps. I think the oysters and claims are more worth getting. They had three different types of oyster (Duxbury, Seahag, and Pleasant bay). I'm not an expert so I couldn't really tell the difference. (If you care, I think the Duxbury was the smallest size.) I loved the cocktail sauce that they provided with the oysters and clams. I didn't care much for the other one. My friend also got the fish and chips. It came out fresh and she really enjoyed it. I didn't try it because I was too full from going to three cannoli shops earlier in the day :/> Street parking; hard to find parking.  Clean interior + exterior.  Seated immediately at around 4pm for table of 5.  We were on an all-day foodie adventure and we all wanted oysters.  We stopped by for dollar oysters and drinks.I tried a New England beer (Northern haze), which doesn't go well with oysters.  The lemon from the oysters made the beer tasted sour.  Rookie mistake.  We ordered 8 dozens of clams and oysters.  All tasted fresh.  I love the meatiness and texture of the clams.  I don't know my oysters but one kind of them tasted awesome.  Slippery texture and meaty and goes very well with zest of lemon and the sauce.","4, 5, 2, 5, 4"

Just a little disappointed how they don't give you the option to choose other kimbaps.The restaurant usually doesn't have a wait time when I go Saturday evenings.

The waiter brought us a couple of small salads before the food came out. For a group of people who could eat a lot, the bill was quite reasonable and we left the place happily stuffed!There are electric hot plates built into the tables to keep your food hot during your meal. Our waiter was very patient and helpful when we asked to move some pots around during the middle of the meal.Army stew: filled with ramen, rice cakes, spam, hot dogs, thinly sliced meat, tofu, and vegetables. The broth is on the lighter side but the dish is very filling. On a separate occasion I've shared this order with one other person and we ended up having leftovers. The portion is pretty big.Ddeokbokki/rabokki: spicy! Rice cakes were cooked perfectly and had a great texture. Both dishes came with a generous amount of fish cakes. If only they served beer to go with it...Kimbap: packed with lots of meat. Tasted good but I wouldn't say it was the highlight of my meal.> It's my favorite spot for Korean food. I love their cheese topokki, fish soup, fried chicken, spice pork. The portion is huge and the service is wonderful. I dine here almost every week and it never disappoints me.> I've come here so many times over the past 2 years and it's honestly one of my favorite places to eat in Allston. Somehow I always find myself craving it.My go to order is the fondue deokbokki because I'm not great with spice and it's one of the more mild options (but it is also just really good and I definitely recommend!!!) I also like the cheese deokbokki a lot because the cheese also kinda neutralizes the spice (and gotta love those cheese pulls) but I like the tonkatsu too! I would definitely recommend sharing/splitting with someone because sometimes it can get a little bit boring/heavy to just eat one thing/deokbokki, so I like being able to change it up a little.One bad thing I will say is that their side dishes are very lacking with a tiny little thing of kimchi and a mini bowl of pretty boring salad (mostly just lettuce). Still, I always end up coming back, which has gotta say something. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving it a try!","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

I wouldn't exactly call the serving staff the friendliest - they seemed a little annoyed and pushy, but it could have just been due to the time. The food was great! Honestly, I'm not the best pho critic - I've never had a bowl that I've never liked - and this one was up to par. My friend got vermicelli noodle bowl with chicken that she thoroughly enjoyed. My only disappointment of the night was my thai iced tea - it was about 80% ice and tasted like water (probably because of the ice). If you're looking for a decent pho place and you're in the Kenmore area, I definitely wouldn't shy away from Pho Common!> I had pho at a chilly night. At 6 p.m. there was no customer, but since 6:10 p.m. customers came in continuously and all tables were occupied, which is a good sign. I am always  a little skeptical about Vietnamese food in Boston, but this place was good (not as good as San Jose pho places). Service is quick which I really like.> Maybe because we visited in the mid-afternoon (3-3:30) instead of the core lunch/dinner time, but The Boy & I did not have that great a meal at Pho Common. Loved the interior and ambiance and the extensive menu but the food was average especially with the wealth of Vietnamese/Pho options available in the Boston area. To start, we got the Grilled Pork Patty Spring Rolls which may have been the best part of this meal. Chewy, well seasoned pork wrapped fresh roll style with a tasty peanut sauce for dipping.For entrees, The Boy wanted the Mongolian Beef - a dish oddly rarely seen in Boston but also odd that it's offered at a Vietnamese restaurant - but they came back and said they don't have it (not sure if that meant in general or just this one time they were out) so The Boy opted for a beef and broccoli dish instead (yes there is a section of the menu dedicated to traditional Americanized Chinese food too...which is not pictured in menu photos online). Was good, not outstanding, rice to goods ratio wasn't in the eater's favor.I ordered my favorite Vietnamese noodle soup, Bun Bo Hue, and despite it being listed under Chef's Specialities, I found overall the broth is very light/mild versus heavily spiced and also my rice noodles over cooked - super soft - super disappointing.I'm willing to come back during non-off hours and give it another go, try our more of the menu but I'm in no rush. I assume it'll continue to be a staple in the neighborhood given Brookline/Fenway's lack of Vietnamese options but still incomparable to Allston/Chinatown restaurants.> Great atmosphere, fast service, clean and modern decor. Love the music vibe they played. I had Bun Bo Hue, beef was tender, noodle perfectly cooked. The broth was not flavorful. I was expecting it to be spicy but it was not. I had  to add chili spice to it. It was my first time there. I will try it again and see if they will do better.> Located so close to Kenmore station, I wish I knew about this place earlier! An amazing pho place to satisfy all your cravings! I came here for a dinner date on a weeknight and was really hungry. This place has a good selection of different pho, buns, and rice dishes. I ordered the XL pork chop pho and it was pretty tasty. The broth of the pho is sweet and light and there were plenty of noodles to go along with it. There was a lot of pork chop to go along with it and I'm glad it was served on a plate instead of in the bowl of pho. The pork chop was cooked well giving it a good texture and flavoring to it. During our dinner service, this place got filled with many college students coming from around the area, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for Viet food.","4, 4, 3, 3, 4"

The owner often comes to the table to welcome his patrons.  The food is always perfectly presented  and not rushed.  Nice wine list too.  It's a large restaurant so will appear  empty but when you are seated it lends itself to a very relaxing meal in an imitate setting. We love the many dishes with squash and pumpkin and the meat  dishes are spiced just right. Don't let the empty tables distract you, it's a wonderful change from typical Italian, American and  steak places  we tend to choose.> First time trying Afghani food and it was wonderful! Servers were very welcoming and offered suggestions on what to order. They basically just said everything was good but they were not wrong.Ordered one of each of the appetizers and we were not disappointed by any - each had their own flavors and they were really delicious. I don't have pictures except one because we ate everything so fast.Had beef, chicken, lamb, and vegetarian entrees and everyone was happy with their order. I ordered the Mourgh Challow and it was a simple dish but  had a lot of flavor. Had some of the Chopan which was especially great and I am not usually a fan of lamb. Would probably order that next time.> The place was delicious, the spices, the aromatics, the flavor - these guys just cant be beat.  If you have an opportunity to visit them, do it, you will not be disappointed.  The place is good for date night.> In the past few years, I've heard that Helmand had sadly gone downhill, and Ariana had moved from its outpost on Brighton Ave.What I had not realized was that Ariana had planted itself on the ground floor of a new construction on the block before Brighton Mills Shopping Center with its McDonald's and Spring Shabu Shabu.  The new space is larger than the old, with a greater depth, and nicely decorated with bright and cheery yellow walls.  It is located directly across from the Shield System Car Wash.  Parking is non-metered street parking only, so read the signs.When it ain't broke, don't fix it...Yeah, I ordered up their Kaddo appetizer $6.95 (pan-fried baby pumpkin seasoned with sugar then baked and topped with ground beef sauce.  Served on garlic yogurt sauce.) to go, and it came in a decent sized portion in a styrafoam clamshell with 3 pieces of their flat bread in a plastic bag.  Yum!I was well satisfied not only with the sweet soft orange gourd with the savory meat sauce and the tangy yogurt sauce, but with the generous portion.  I was also surprised by the bread, but I made good use of them by consuming them along with the soft sweet appetizer.  I was happy and content.I also went back for another order for my parents to sample.  The portion was still quite good, as was the taste.  Oddly, however, it came with 2 pieces of the bread vs the 3 I received the first time.> My favorite restaurant in Boston and one of my favorite restaurants I've tried period. Ariana has unique, delicious dishes that you really won't find elsewhere. My favorites are the pumpkin with yogurt and beef sauce (this is so unbelievably delicious it's too hard to describe), the manti (dumplings in yogurt sauce) and eggplant in yogurt and tomato sauce which are just off the charts. Even their bread and sauces they provide before the food is unreal. I haven't fully explored their main dishes to the extent I'd like to but I certainly will in the future. I've had Afghani food elsewhere in the US but nothing compares to Ariana. The prices are also incredibly affordable. You really won't have a better meal in Boston.","5, 4, 5, 4, 4"

I got a lobster roll and it was heavenly. The house-made chips were thick and crispy so we were looking for a chance to go back. These are some things we got during Dine Out Boston 2020! The food was phenomenal, to say the least. For $25 lunch, we got an appetizer, entree, and dessert - a steal from Summer Shack considering that most entrees are between $14-16. We left feeling very full and very happy.> Very disappointing.  We took our daughter here for her birthday thinking it would be like our experience with the Summer Shack in Cambridge, sadly it was not.The waitress was very pushy about certain meals and abrupt.  My husband ordered the king crab legs, however he got snow crab legs and they were $50.00 for a pound and not hot.  It took forever for our meals and we think that one meal was held up that's why the others were cold. The corn bread was stale.  I wanted no butter on my lobster, however they paintbrushed it on anyway and it was very greasy.  The lobster was cold and rubbery.  My daughter did get a nice birthday dessert.> My first time at a Summer Shack, not sure how I have never been here with my love of seafood and considering how close the two locations are. It was just ok, I wasnt wowed, I think our server might have had a bad night and I wanted more info & pointers but he was Meh the whole time.  The food was ok, I mean it was good, but I wasnt as impressed as I had wanted to be, but again that might have been because this was like a Bucket list visit and maybe in my mind the anticipation build up just didnt come through. The Lobster, Totally messed up & ordered the wrong one, got the Ginger Scallion and the flavoring (which I Love on ANY other food) just overpowered the Lobster taste (Which I do happen to love). Will possibly try again and maybe with a smaller group, we were 8 and just not enough food to share with all of us, would rather go with the hubby and taste more, he did love his burger (I know a burger at a Seafood shack, hey that's him!!) LOL!!Will try again and then update if Im wow'ed and get the experience Im hoping!> First time to SS Boston.  Great choice!  Busy but now crowded.  There were 8 in our party and Antonio, our server, was friendly and accomodating.  I think everyone enjoyed their selections.  I had the salmon which came with an awesome grain salad and beets.  Super choice.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  I also ordered the buffalo cauliflower for the table.  A bit pricey for the amount of cauliflower, but it was delicious.  Next time I'm in Boston, would love to try again.> Very nice landing spot, abandoned by my family, warm atmosphere, good food, lots of beers, sports on the tube.Cobb salad was delightful. Very very light vinaigrette; so light, I asked for extra.Fried whole belly clams, hard to find outside this region - a real treat. I asked for cocktail sauce. Tartar sauce is for fish-n-chips, IMO.Super nice staff, especially Chris the Bartender.I shall return.","5, 2, 3, 4, 4"

First impression was good--table was ready and the service was prompt. They were also very accommodating to our requests. We did bring a cake and they charged $5 per person for the cutting and serving, but we were more than OK with that. There was like 7 of us so we ordered a lot of food and a bottle of sake to share. The yuzu sake is absolutely delicious and I am now on the hunt for my own bottle. Totally recommend if you are starting off with sakes and/or like sweet and refreshing ones. They do have an extensive sake and drink menu, something I could not find online so I was looking forward to seeing it in person. Was not disappointed at all. As for food, I ordered the squid ink noodles and three pieces of nigiri from the a la carte menu. First of all, I did not expect to see gold flakes on the noodles. That made it extra fancy and very 'grammable. The noodles were very delicious, said the other three people that took a few bites. I also got to try others' entrees, like the Chilean sea bass and the uni pasta. YUM. The sushi was pretty good, albeit on the pricey side. I would say I liked the noodles more than the sushi, but this place is solid if you are looking for a restaurant for a special occasion.> Was browsing for a Valentine's Day dinner location on the web and came across this wonderful place. I wanted to definitely make it a special night so I went ahead and made a reservation about a month ahead. Smart decision that I have because it was extremely busy when me and my girlfriend arrived. We waited a bit but not too long to be seated. Once seated, we looked through the menu and much of it was enticing since we love Japanese food. To start off, we ordered the flaming salmon, Japanese Wagyu cooked on a hot stone, lychee martini for my lady, and a mixed drink for myself as well. The flaming salmon was brought out to us on fire which was a pretty fun to experience and even more fun to eat. The drinks were by far the best we have ever had. Well made and not overwhelming. The Japanese Wagyu on the hot stone was an amazing introduction to what it is like! We never had it but only heard great things about it and surely, it did not disappoint! If anybody is interested in it, there are two different variants of it. One being I believe American? And the other being Japanese. With that said, the Japanese one is more expensive but I believe it to be due to being more authentic. Every bite of the Wagyu was savored and opened up a gate of happiness to us.For our entrées, we both ordered the A5 Wagyu Steaks, an order of the Ultimate shrimp sushi rolls, and one uni. I was anticipating how the A5 Wagyu was since I was already blown away just from the appetizer alone. Once our food came, my first bite out of the steak was nothing short of pure bliss. Truly a tender, flavorful, and delicious steak. What people say about A5 Wagyu is true and lives up to its reputation. I am a believer (although I never doubted) of how amazing this steak is. It is the most expensive steak I had ever ordered but well worth the money for sure. As for the sushi, nothing short of incredible and same goes for the uni. Never had uni (sea urchin) but also heard good things about it and I can see why anybody would like it. To end things, we just kept things simple and got the shaved ice with lychee. Didn't expect much from it since you really can't go wrong with it. Only thing I can really say about is to mix it up a bit before eating so you can get the full potential out of it. Overall, Oishii Boston is truly and genuinely an amazing place for a lovely evening with your significant other. The food is undeniably fresh and well done. Only docked 1 star just because service was a bit too slow and kind of made us a feel bit forgotten. Despite the small complaint, it is easily forgiven due to the nature of Valentine's Day. The addition of the rose and chocolate covered strawberries parting gifts was also icing on the cake. I highly recommend coming here even if you just want to experience what is to be offered here. This visit made me even more excited to visit Japan soon!    To conclude things, me and my girlfriend absolutely enjoyed our experience and would like to say thank you to all of the staff that night for providing us a blissful evening. We will be returning some time in the future!> Amazing food there! I enjoyed a wonderful lunch there. Salmon on the fire: amazing !!!  Everyone should try this dish. It tasted a little bit spicy and with various flavors. If you don't like raw fish, you must try this!Special sushi: I tried 5 different kinds of special sushi which were on the last page of the menu; foie gras with truffle, wagyu beef, spicy toro, lobster tempura, Ankimo. I would definitely recommend all of them! They were all amazing!!! I highly recommend trying as much specialty sushi as you can. Treasure spoon: A rich flavor with uni, oyster, and fish roe? (not sure) The spoon could also be eaten. It was good but not so much amazing. If you want to try all the things together, choose this.Two special dishes: 1. toro with a cold radish: a special dish which I never tried before. So delicious! However, it tasted a little bit similar to salmon on the fire. You could just order one of them depends on whether you want to eat hot or cold dishes. 2. chef's wagyu beef (forget the name). The only dish I would not recommend ordering it. Too salty and sweet. It tasted like a chinese dish that broccoli and beef but replace broccoli with a kind of fried tofu? I could not taste the original wagyu beef flavor.Anyway, highly recommend this place!!!> This place is great for a quiet evening with a cozy ambience. I really felt like I felt a little extra peaceful just being here.The fish was incredible fresh and very well made, and we were able to enjoy so many different items! Everything from the rolls to the single pieces of nigiri and sashimi were so delicious! They also gave us a ""muse bouche"" to start the meal that was really well done! I think the presentation of their fish was something else that I noticed they put extra effort into - really lovely.I think something they're known for is this dessert shaped like an egg (the ""coconut sphere""), where yo crack the outer ""shell"" and there is a gooey dessert underneath. This was very good, but the sushi was definitely the highlight for me! Service was slow, but otherwise we had an exceptional time!> I had a super excellent dining experience and possibly one of the best sushi meals ever here.Reservations are easy, but the exterior is super low key so make sure you know where you're going. I came on a rainy night and had a bit of trouble finding the door. Once inside, the service was super excellent from the host to the bartender to the server. My friend and I stayed until closing and they were super patient with us. The interior is sleek, modern, but not pretentious. It has a sushi bar look but is much nicer than the average sushi bar. There is both a cocktail bar up front and a sushi bar. The restaurant isn't huge, but the lay out makes pretty good use of the space. I tried a delicious martini with passion fruit, and the bartender was super nice and asked what I thought of it.As for food, we got a bunch of the nigiri which you can check off with a pencil on the back page of the menu. All the fish was super fresh!I loved the salmon on fire appetizer- it is equally as delicious as is beautiful and definitely worth the higher price tag as the slices of fish are huge. Equally as memorable was the steak tartare, probably the best steak tartare I've tried. I don't remember what else we tried, so I would say those dishes are the most memorable. Overall a great upscale sushi spot with fresh fish, good drinks, and friendly service. On my list of top sushi restaurants in Boston (and probably the USA!) for sure!","4, 4, 5, 4, 5"

I'm pretty sure every single plate was completely clean afterwards. The breakfast pizza looks small but is DEEP. So it is FILLING. The girls were stuffed. The chicken and waffles could feed a small family they gave him so much chicken. My waffle was delicious- barely needed any syrup because of the whipped cream on top. We all enjoyed the drinks as well. The bloody's were spicy, so if you like spicy you'll love these. The atmosphere was definitely busy but not excessively loud. Our waiter was great and the food came out quickly!> Party of 3, arrived at 12:30pm on a Sunday. Restaurant wasn't too packed- we all got seated right away and a server immediately came up and brought us water.I ended up ordering from the brunch menu, and got the eggs benedict because it is topped with pork belly- and I LOVE pork belly. My friends got a vegetarian shakshuka (sp?) and a daily special, which was a bacon hash. I tried the shakshuka and did like it. However, if you're not a fan of spicy food, I'd stay away since I was caught off guard with how spicy it was. The eggs benedict were good, but I was disappointed with the pork belly. The slices were on the dry side, which was surprising to me, because it's difficult to make a fatty cut of meat dry. However, the slices were nice and thick, so at least I got a lot of meat.> Brunch on New Year's Day with friends.

My friend and I split the curly fries with garlic aioli (yum!!!) and they were crispy yet soft and also had that mild curly fry spice flavor. We also split the red lentil and chickpea falafel which was good! Most importantly it was pretty big and we were pretty stuffed with just those dishes (and had some to go!)Finally we got a side of cauliflower (health) and it was pretty good!

I've been going here since it first opened in Boston, and it has the best tasting Korean Fried chicken for the Soy Garlic flavor!In terms of food, I would recommend the avocado salad and Half & Half wings/drums.  It's enough for 3 people, and some leftovers. Delicious  just thinking about bonchon wings has me hungry.> I had the worst experience today. I am completely mind blown and speechless. Never have I ever received this type of service/treatment for takeout. I work in the industry and worked at a competing restaurant (past) and I understand the process of cooking the chicken, and wait time.  I ordered on Yelp for take-out today at 3:45pm. I got the email and everything, and when I arrived to the restaurant my boyfriend went inside and said that they did not have my order (okay, no big deal we can figure this out), he then texts me that he sees the slip and the the employee had told him she had ""forgot to send it"" (okay, again, no big deal; i get it, when taking an order from these apps most places have to manually put it in). She then asks him does he want to wait and she can rush an order and ""it'll be 15-20mins"". He texted me and asked if that's okay, I said as long as it's not another 30 mins then I don't mind. We would have never agreed if she had said 30-45 mins. We were already waiting in the car for 20 mins. She said she'd give us a discount, which was not my intention but it was nice enough to offer since it was their mistake on their end. I'm sitting in the car, my boyfriend is inside waiting. The employees are well aware of his presence, but does not once alert him ""it'll be 10 more mins"" or even apologize for the wait. All we ordered was small wings, French fries, and the salmon avocado salad. I saw at least 10 people go in and out and grab their food with no issue. Quick go in and go out. Finally it's been at least 40 mins, and he goes and asks where the food was. The employee was confused. Then the girl that took the order had forgotten it behind the sushi bar... this whole time it was already ready..... be he was standing there when the time was up. And the girl was just too busy texting on her phone.He comes into the car with the food and tells me the story, I look in the bag, fries are soggy, no chopsticks, no napkins, no nothing. I go inside because I was honestly disappointed in everything. I go inside and asked them what the deal was. Why was this experience like this? What was the issue? I told them no utensils, the guy gives 1 chopstick. No napkins no wet nap or anything, and I think (but couldn't see correctly) I think he gave a single pair of chopstick. When I was talking to the girl, I explained her my frustration, and she proceeds to say ""you cancelled the order"" and I asked her why would I do that when I've been waiting in the car for almost an hour. If I was going to do something like that I would not leave my car running for that long for no reason. I showed her the email and said ""well I didn't cancel it, it was you"" and then I asked her so how come when my boyfriend was in here you couldn't even alert him about the time. She said ""the avocado salmon salad takes a long time"" it takes 40 mins for that salad?!? The double fried chicken wings takes about 30 mins between frying, and saucing, and packaging. How can a sushi appetizer take that long unless it was a hamachi Kama or hotate hokiyaki. She doesn't even apologize for anything and proceeds to blame it on me and the salad. There wasn't even a promised  discount on there to makeup for their mistake. So you offered a solution but didn't even go by it. I also asked her why did you tell my boyfriend it'd be 20-30 mins and her response was ""I didn't I told him 30-45mins"" she then just said I'll return the food and give you your money back. At that point the food was already cooled off because when it got into the car I opened up the fries to see and it was just 'warm' no crunch, no heat. I told her I would never have agreed to wait another 30 mins if that's what she had said in the first place. And why would my boyfriend lie to me when he didn't even want bonchon in the first place. It was me who wanted it, so he had nothing to gain out of waiting longer. So at the end of the day, total time wasted on bonchon takeout with no takeout was about 1hr 30mins, and still left hungry. First meal of the day, great way to start my day. I then called later to speak to the manager and asked for the girls name. The guy refused to let me speak to anyone or answer my question and responded to me with ""uh why"" I still have my email of grubhub that my order was sent, and that it got cancelled.> I have been coming to BonChon since I was in highschool. It's been the same, always a wait on Fri-Sun evenings (quicker lines on Sundays). Still known for the fried chicken. The wings come out super hot and crispy, drizzled in soy garlic sauce. The fries here I feel like are super under rated. They are thiccccck and crispy af. The bibimbap, my only complaint was that our yolk was overcooked :( but the dish itself was still amazing :) the okonomiyaki is still as fun as ever with the squid flakes curling.I've ordered the beef japchae here before and they were able to make that not spicy :) the budae jigae is fun, but pricey and comes out spicy hahaha unlike the camrbidge bonchon, this one has a drink menu! The sushi here is honestly not too expensive. I feel like I've had the same foods here for years now haha I really should switch to trying their sushi.> Good as usual. I haven't been here for quite some time because of several reasons: hard to find parking, long line and long drive for me. Today was an exception because not many people on the road. The crispy salmon salad was awesome! It is similar to their famous avocado salad. The chicken wings (spicy) is top notch. Nothing in Boston can compare to the sauce that this place uses. I think that is why they maintain their position after years. We got a stew with kimchi, meatloaf and beef. It was a lot!!! $19 and I think it's enough to feed 3 hungry people just with this stew alone. Definitely great spot in Allston!!> One of my favorite Korean Fried chicken places. Their chicken can be spicy so don't forget to let your server know what level of spice you would like. The fried chicken serving is good for 2-3 and even 4 ppl. Ambiance is good and the place is really good for fried chicken joint. Their fries are also really nice. Good food for money. Must try!","5, 1, 4, 5, 4"

Made a delivery order and on top of the really rude manager on the telephone taking our order, the delivery man was rude too because he was angry we didn't give him a bigger tip. He also wore no gloves or mask during the exchange, which should be mandatory at this time. The food was cold when it was delivered even though we're right down the street from the restaurant. The biggest insult I can't get over is the LARGE Tom Yum soup we ordered. It came in a large container and half full... I've never seen a restaurant casually try to pass this off. When I called in and spoke to the manager again he refused to change the cost of the soup. He said he didn't know how to change the price on the machine (even being a manager) and the best he could do is bring more broth in half an hour. We already were hesitant to order because of COVID-19 concerns as well as how uncomfortable the delivery driver made us we declined so we paid more for less. I love Thai food so we wanted to try something new but after this experience and the restaurant taking no attempts to correct the problem properly I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. The food was not worth the hassle. Very bland!> Came here on a Friday night at 7PM and was told that it was a 2-hour wait. Seeing that there were only two-parties ahead of us, we're unsure of why we were given a 2-hour wait estimate. They don't take down phone numbers, so we stuck around the area. Within 30 minutes, we were seated. No stress, but the individual taking down names might need a refresher on how to come up with estimate wait times. For a party of 3, we ordered the Tom Yum Goong, yellow curry with tofu, Moo Grob Pad Ped -$15.95 (Crispy pork rind with Thai spices and herbs), and Yum Plar Dook Fu -$17.95 (Thai style crispy and puffy catfish meat on romaine lettuce, served with shredded mango, red onions, and lemongrass in spicy lime dressing). Service: Not great. Throughout the meal, I felt rushed as the wait staff kept coming to our table to clear one plate here and there. It was close to 8 by the time we were finishing up dinner and there was no longer a wait. I'm not sure why there seems to be a need to clear out our plates one by one. Food: Every place makes the tom yum goong differently. This place is definitely on the sweeter end and the soup was filled with different mushrooms and one shrimp. The yellow curry with tofu was delicious and paired perfectly with rice. (BTW: all entrees do not come with rice, so you'll have to order it on the side). The Moo Grob Pad Pad flavor was on point, definitely on the spicy end! The pork rind pieces were a bit touch in the beginning. Let it soak in the sauce longer and it'll tender up. I would not recommend ordering the Yum Plar Dook Fu. First of all, I was expecting to taste catfish in the crispy and puffy catfish meat as stated on the menu. However, when the dish arrived, it just felt like crispy panko on top of the salad. Sure, the dressing to the salad was tasteful. But where's the fish that we paid $17.95 for?!The food here is good. I would definitely come back and try their other dishes. (And secretly hope that wait times are closer to accurate estimates).> Right off the bat, the service was incredible. Even with a party of 12, the food began arriving to our table in just about 10 minutes (and we ordered about 10 dishes). My favorites were the tom yum soup, the pork red curry (which is great over rice), and the dish with raw shrimp (I forget what it's called). Every dish was extremely flavorful and has a great amount of spice. Some of my friends were sweating. The desserts are also fantastic - fried ice cream, bua loy, strawberry cheesecake - everything was the perfect level of sweetness. Perfect place for small or large groups, just make sure you put a reservation down. Definitely coming back!> Hot lunch on a cold day.Dirty snow and sour soup.   One a mess, one a balm. So yes, get the tom yum soup.We had pad thai and tofu green curry.The pad thai, properly served with crisp raw sprouts, set aside to be mixed  fresh into the noodles.

Food was fresh, filling, and spic (I love spicy, so this was purposeful). I will be back! Excellent food & atmosphere!> I've only gotten delivery from Thai Basil. I have ordered yellow curry with chicken and steamed noodles, chicken satay, and pork dumplings. The yellow curry is my favorite that I have found in the city so  far. You  can customize spice levels, it is rich and creamy, and the portion is huge - easily enough for 2 meals. The chicken satay is spot on. The chicken quality of the satay is much better than the chicken quality in the other dishes- marinated, juicy, and fresh. The peanut sauce was a bit thick but still good and went great with the cucumber sauce. The steamed dumplings were not as good as the other 2 items in this review, but still solid. They were flavorful, but do not hold up well in delivery. Also they were very small. Overall I will continue to order delivery from here as my go to Thai spot in Boston.> I've been here a bunch of times over the last 6 months and I always get the Red Curry. Today I ordered it for pickup but they gave me Yellow curry instead. When I mentioned it should be Red Curry, the woman working there said I ordered Yellow (I've never ordered Yellow Curry anywhere) and that she confirmed this on the phone (she never confirmed anything). She accused me of changing my order even after I told her I was a REPEAT customer and this is my order every time. After repeating how *I* screwed up the order and it's *my* fault, I told her I'm not paying for the wrong order. For a Thai place that has *decent* food (but nothing compared to other cities or states), it's a little pricey for what you get. But it doesn't matter now because they just lost this customer.> 3.5 average rating is pretty accurate. I have been here several times, all during busy lunch hours.I never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated for a table of two. They are always busy during lunch, but it seems like they have a system down. I have always tried the drunken noodles. The portion size is good for one person if hungry (or people like me who is always hungry). On my most recent visit, I tried the Panang curry, and it was also delicious! Again, I eat a lot, so it was very filling for me. If you don't eat that much, you can save it for a second meal!The only thing is that if you were to order an appetizer, tell the waiter to bring it out together with your main entree. The first time I ordered the Thai wings (highly recommend!), they didn't serve my entree until after I finished the appetizer. On my next visit, I let them they could bring my entree out as well. They did just that. And that minimized my lunch hour wait time. If you want to bring a large group (say more than 5 people), better come here before noon to grab your table. Otherwise, try to come before 12:15 for immediate seating for small groups.> Portions are decent. Price also very reasonable, with tip was like $60 for 5 people for lunch. Faves were def the crispy pad Thai and regular pad Thai, super flavorful. The crispy chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I'd recommend mixing the crispy pad Thai with the regular pad Thai for that difference in texture, so good. Drunken noodles was good, slightly spicy but not overwhelming. The appetizer golden tofu was plentiful, came out in a mini basket, very crunchy as well. The green curry was ok, a tad bland to me, but then I'm not a huge fan of curry.","5, 4, 1, 4, 4"

High ceilings, dim lighting, dark walls etc. Would be perfect for a romantic date or special occasion. Service - Service was just ok. Our drinks took a while to come out, but that could be because of our larger party.Food - Fantastic. I got the lobster tagliatelle ($37) and it was to die for. Al dente pasta, grilled cherry tomato, juicy lobster chunks, tarragon, and hazelnuts. I'm still dreaming about it. While not a cheap meal, Lucca Back Bay checks most, if not all, the boxes.> It is my 2nd time coming here and they never disappoint! The food was delicious.

Definitely worth a visit.> Its lowkey on the outside but the food is amazing! The owner was very friendly and helped me choose a goat roti. The food is delicious and the portions are huuge. Wont disappoint> So so yummy! We discovered this unassuming little shop after seeing it get written up in Boston Eater and boy am I glad we decided to swing by after catching a movie at South Bay. We ordered the oxtail roti (~$13) and the chicken bone-in dinner plate ($13), plus a peanut drink ($5). The oxtail roti was wrapped in soft, fragrant roti and accompanied by rice, beans, potatoes, and generous amounts of tender, fall-off-the-bone oxtail. Careful, it was bone-in! The bone-in chicken was similarly tasty, and accompanied by two sides of your choice -- I choose the cabbage which was a perfect partner; if not light, it was a nice vegetable pairing against the heavier chicken and rice. The potato side was also really tasty, fragrant and spicy. The peanut drink was a bit heavy for me, and very sweet, but I enjoyed it nonetheless (well, I drank a few swigs and saved the rest for later).Sure, $30 for such a humble shop seems steep, but given how much meat you're getting and the size of the portions, it easily is lasting us 4 meals, so I say that's a huge win. Service is friendly. No parking but we were able to find a convenient space down the side street.> Doesn't look like much when you walk in but listen this place their food is full of flavor...real flavor, I never had Trini food before and the owner helped me with picking out what to buy I ordered a goat plate OMFG it was amazingly delicious and a boneless chicken rotti I'll be back very soon!> Overrated!I went out of my way to order food from Singh's roti shop. I got a veggie roti, mac and cheese, cabbage, and greens. I come from a West Indian background, so I'm always down for some yard food. I catch this place right before it closed. Their staff started off as a walking stereotype; they were rude, short, and unpleasant.  I took the food back to my hotel and preferred to go to KFC across the street and just get sides. The veggies bland and tasted sour. The roti was trash I have better chickpeas from a can. The mac and cheese went straight to the garbage. After reading everyone review, I just knew I was in for a treat, but this isn't it.  At least on the veggie side.","5, 5, 5, 5, 1"

It has a great ambiance and never disappoints. It has a great variety but also has very tasty food. The Brussels sprout salad is great, avocado toast, steak burrito or French toast. I've honestly never had a bad meal here. They also make their own Bloody Mary mix which is amazing. I only come for brunch because at night has more of a family vibe which I am not for yet. 100% recommended for brunch! Oh also great prices> (3.75) ~ Good overall Tavern with lots of Charger ports throughout the seating area;) Note: It's near Gate B6.MENU:** Water(tap) = (4) very good, must be filtered;)* French Fries = (3.75) Good* Smash Burger = (3.5) good, but a little too salty...> I've never been disappointment by their brunch. I'm almost scared to come at another time of day because I don't want to break the spell. Making reservations is easy and it doesn't take 3+ weeks of forethought, like other places in Boston. Even when I wanted a last-minute table for Father's Day, they were able to deliver. They've never had us wait for our reservation and service is always warm and attentive. But most importantly -- the food. It's never missed the mark. I've had wildly different things (savory vs. sweet, breakfast vs. lunch) and have always been impressed. Get pancakes for the table. You won't regret it!> So I decided to come back to give Monument another shot--this time going for brunch, and left happier.I came back and decided to try their brunch menu, although admittedly ate more lunch than anything breakfast related. Unfortunately for my wife, there weren't too many egg free/gluten free options for breakfast foods (usually you'll see a sides option where you can order just bacon, or potatoes--although we did ask for an order of potatoes and they were able to place that for us). Food: Much better than previously. My wife had the carnitas tacos (which she said overall were a bit disappointing due to the pork being a bit dry, although still flavorful and both tacos falling apart while eating them. Maybe it needs two tortillas? The rosemary chicken wings were phenomenal (her favorite part of the meal and we surprised they came with 8), the side of potatoes great and my white pizza was delicious as well. I know this might be me being picky, but for a 2 dollar extra charge, I'd have been even happier if there was a possibility to put prosciutto on the white pizza.Drinks: I stuck with something easier here and it didn't disappoint. The Mexican mule was excellent. Décor/ambience: Packed to the brim on a Sunday mid morning. Can't say enough the place looks great. Really love the ceilings!Service: Overall decent. We did only have napkin/cutlery set at our table when were seated, and it took two reminders before they brought over just the napkin lol. Luckily most of the food could be eaten by hand (wings, tacos, and pizza), and we just shared the fork for the potatoes. It didn't really take away from our experience and it was pretty crowded so I won't judge this too harshly.Overall, will be coming back for the pizza and to try the spicy chili chicken wings.> My partner and I both got sandwiches, which barely fit on the table together with water and drinks. I kept thinking I was going to knock something off. This is also one of those places where you will be on top of the table next to you -- so probably not good for a first date (it was not for us, but seemed like it was 2 tables down). We thought the server forgot about us a few times, but maybe they just didn't see our table since they did all look like one. I had the veggie torta which was really good, but a lot of bread. I could have done with more filling. There was also an over abundance of fries, which made me think they were just trying to fill me up on carbs (I was going to a party after so I'm not really upset with that), and, again, I could have gone for more substance.","5, 4, 5, 4, 3"

Honestly Italian food is on every corner in this city but I had a great eggplant parm sandwhich that stood out to me. I've now been twice and I'll go back again because of the variety of really good lunch options. Owner is a sweetheart and a real local!> Just okay. The service was fast and friendly. The food wasn't anything impressive though. I even willingly waited 10 minutes for fresh pizza so I could taste it at its best. It was just plain cheese pizza (which I love), but honestly I think Domino's is better. I also got a chocolate chip corn muffin. It was just okay. I don't really have anything bad to say about Rustico, but nothing really good either.> Food is great. I'd say the prices are fair. I paid close to $10 (including tax) for a caprese salad with 5 slices of tomatoes, 4 slices of mozzarella, balsamic glaze, and arugula. Cashier is not friendly. Kitchen staff is more friendly. I called to ask how long it would take for a salad to be prepared and she said no longer than 5 minutes, so I ordered it. After waiting 5 minutes I asked how much longer it would be. She looked at me as if she was annoyed (she was chatting with her coworker) and said ""I don't know"". I said OK; you said it'd be no longer than 5 min. I have a meeting to get to. Can you check? She checked and the chef actually made sure I got my salad quickly, so kudos to the kitchen staff and chef!> Showed up at 7:15 AM Their front door was open, but they had placed a plastic table in the doorway so no one could enter.I made awkward eye contact with the guy behind the counter from outside and that was it- no smile, no hello, no explanation. He looked like he wanted to murder me.No coffee for me I guess. I went elsewhere and I can guarantee I won't be back.> We ordered the cheese pizza, aunties fav salad, and a side of meatballs. I would say their pizza is just as good as Regina's in the north end. Also, I didn't know you could order meatballs on the side. I'm so glad I asked bc those meatballs were amazing! Someone walking by the window stopped in to ask me what I ordered. Highly recommend this place.","5, 2, 3, 1, 5"

I got the terrific one!  Mine was fusili boscaila (pardon the spelling) - pasta with sausage and greens. The overall dish came together in a fine combination of flavor.This restaurant features a healthy wine list ranging from about $35 a bottle to $150. Dinner ranged form about $20-$35 but mostly in the low 20s. Did I mention the large dessert drink selection? Love it.I would absolutely come back!> This is the first Yelp review I've ever written, which says a lot about this restaurant. With so many Italian restaurants to choose from in the North End, I am so happy we stumbled upon Cantina Italiana.We started with the Fried Calamari and antipasti -- both were perfect. For entrees, I had the pesto with homemade pasta and my boyfriend had the Fra Diavolo. To finish, we had the tiramisu which was one of the best desserts I've ever consumed. To top it off, our waitress was lovely and attentive.I 100% recommend this place to anyone in the area!> I just needed to smell that Chef Boiardi ragu aroma. So I had to go to Cantina Italiana. Opened the big door and the smell and buzz of activity hit my nose, eyes and ears. Luckily there was a stool, actually a couple, so I grabbed one. Then the heads snapped and turned. AC walked in. Sat down. Next to me.    ""Alex Cora?"" I asked.    ""Yup,"" he said. ""Bottle of cheap Chianti, please.""    ""Yes, Mr. Cora."" And with that a bottle in the traditional basket came out with two glasses.    ""Good, you read my mind, one for my new friend."" Alex pushed a glass my way and signaled to the bartender to fill them up. Once done we clinked glasses.    ""Tough day, Skipper?""    ""You know I hate that term right?""    ""Sorry, bad day AC?""    ""The worst.""    ""Is it true?""    ""Not a word.""And with that we sat silently, finished the bottle and ate classic Sunday Italian. When we were done, we shook hands, I picked up the tab, and AC Uber'd to Logan. As he pulled away, the car suddenly stopped and the rear window rolled down. AC looks at me and says, ""It was a good run but this town's no good for me no more. Too bad, I had such swagger.""> The North End is filled with its hits and misses, sprinkled in between the classics like Mike's Pastry and Vittoria Cafe, but Cantina is a total home run in my carb-loving book of Best Italian Eats. I came here for my birthday dinner and it's like being transported to old Italy -- you walk into the sounds of Italian being spoken, smell the comforting zing of tomato sauce, and imagine someone's nonna cooking up a homemade pasta dish for you. There's a certain charm to the whole place that I haven't really found replicated in any other restaurant in Little Italy. Maybe it's the booths -- being seated in one puts you in a little world of your own, where despite it being super busy / a packed house, you feel like you can have an intimate conversation with your table, and savor over all the dishes you ordered together, sharing pieces of your dish with your friends and family, just like you'd imagine a homey Italian dinner.We were on a time crunch with tickets to a show, but somehow our (amazingly efficient / sweet) waiter was able to work with the kitchen to get our dishes out quickly and impeccably cooked. I had the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia (Bombolotti pasta, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, marinara sauce, parmigiano), while we shared a few apps I can barely recall since we devoured them so quickly. I had never had bombolotti, but this was hands down my favorite of everything we ordered. The pasta was cooked SO perfectly, and that sauce! Suffice to say, I'll never train for a sprint or a marathon, but I can proudly say I can devour a multi-course Italian meal in under 45 minutes. Which should be record-holding, in some country, I'm sure. It's generally impossible to get my niece to a) eat her dinner or b) talk to any strangers, and she literally left hi-fiving the waiter and saying how amazing the spaghetti was, so home run it is:).> Delicious food but unfortunately also an extremely long wait to get said food!I came with two friends on a Sunday night and we were seated immediately, but our food took more than 30 minutes to be served. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the fact that we sat right next to where the food comes out of the kitchen so we were disappointed many times as servers came out with food but it wasn't ours.In addition, my friend somehow got a half order instead of a full order. The bad news is that as a result the full order took an additional 10 minutes to come out (the other two of us were almost done with our food by the time his full order came out). The good news is that the waitress was able to get him an extra large order as compensation.I had the shrimp scampi and would definitely recommend it to anyone who comes here. The noodles are well cooked and the sauce is well flavored -- not too salty or oily but still flavorful.Besides food taking a long time to be served, service was good. We had complimentary bread and our waters were refilled promptly throughout the meal.I would give this place another try but only if I have a lot of time to spare and good company to come with.","5, 5, 5, 5, 3"

Such a cute place with super tasty  Mediterranean food. Got the spicy feta dip with pita which was sooo good (but the olive oil drizzle on top was a little much for me) and the eggplant parm pizza which was the BEST eggplant pizza I've ever had--the eggplant was perfectly fried and there was some pesto drizzle on it?Drinks were also good. Cucumber mule was a nice refreshing twist on the classic and the Snowbunny was good but was definitely served with too much ice. Espresso martini with hazelnut sounds amazing, but didn't try it yet.Service was also great! Our server was very enthusiastic, polite and attentive. He came by multiple times to check in on us and was very friendly.Overall would definitely come back--they have an extensive vegetarian menu with many affordable and delicious options, especially for a restaurant in this location on Atlantic Ave.> While service was a bit hit or miss (it didn't take long to have glasses filled with water or to place a drink order, but it took awhile to place our food order), I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. My friend and I split the herbed falafel ($9.00), local burrata ($14.00), heirloom squash ravioli (14.00), and hickory smoked pepperoni flatbread ($16.00). We had ordered the chicken meatballs and did not receive them but were charged for them. My friend handled it like a consummate gentleman. As he goes to hand our cards to the server, he noted food was excellent but said we did not receive the meatballs. The server immediately apologized and said he would remove the charge, but in an example of hit or miss service, he came back with our cards and the receipts but stopped to talk with the kitchen staff before returning to us. (We were seated at the bar which overlooks the staff making food.) This is forgivable as he went to check to see if the staff could make the meatballs for us. We were both full so we declined. I ordered the burrata because I recalled my friend liked it at another place. We both concluded it was an excellent dish with the apple-pear chutney and grapes but that it did not have enough bread.I could have done without the falafel - nothing special. My friend liked the ravioli and thought it tasted great. I kept getting salty bites so I did not care for that dish. The flatbread was good but I thought the pepperoni was too salty. What was most surprising to me was my friend's proclamation that dessert was the best part of the meal. This was after my hemming and hawing about whether to order one and then what to get. I was pretty full at that point but was curious to see what Trade had to offer. Throughout the night, we saw staff preparing creme brulees, which I normally like, but the menu said it was mango flavored with coconut sorbet. While I like those flavors, something about the combination and not wanting anything tropical turned me off. I was also interested in the toffee pudding but didn't know if I would like the date cake. The chocolate tahini cast iron cookie sounded interesting but I was put off by the tahini and sesame tuile description. In the end, we opted for it and neither of us regret the decision. The cookie came out of the wood stove in a cast iron gooey and warm and was topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The sesame tuile was not as bad as I expected. It gave a nice crunch and textural balance to an otherwise soft and amorphous final course. There were two large groups when we went on Saturday night; one was celebrating a birthday and a special cake or something was brought out with candles. Otherwise, pairs to smaller groups of 5 and 6 dined there.> My company planned a prix fixe dinner at Trade a few months ago, and I didn't have a clue on what to expect that night. Upon arrival, we were escorted into a nice private room with beautiful plates and wine glasses laid out on a long wooden table. To keep things short and not to bore yall, everything we had on the prix fixe menu was delicious! Brussel sprouts were my fave. I chose the striped bass dish as my entree, and I was blown away by the flavors. Portions might have been a little small, but I'll let it slide this time since my taste buds were quite impressed.The dessert, a summer tart with raspberry jam and fresh berries, was also something I haven't had before, but it again was an outstanding dish!I'll try to come back sometime again to try their regular menu, but based on the food I've had during my company event, I'd recommend people to go if you got some extra dough to spend ;)> I really enjoyed this beautiful space, decor and lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, our server left a bit to be desired. There were a number of errors she made- forgot a spread we ordered, forgot our Brussels sprouts, was delayed on a number of items and rarely checked in on drinks. At one point we said we no longer needed an item because it was so late but she immediately returned with it and said ""it was ready"" eesh. She even complained about opening our wine bottle at one point. I would come back but would likely sit at the bar.> My daughter made a reservation at Trade when we came to visit her in the city.  When we got to the restaurant we were told it was small plates meant to share.  Normally that is not my thing and I was skeptical.  I am happy to say I was completely wrong and really enjoyed my night.  The food was excellent.  I loved the Chicken Meatballs.  We ordered a second dish of them they were that good.  It is a fun concept.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

We had a great ordering experience and were excited to dig in to our food once we were home. Unfortunately I opened up my order and it was wrong. Since I was no longer at the location, I couldn't go in and change my order. This was unfortunate since I couldn't eat the plate I was given by accident. I understand accidents happen, but this meant I still never got to try the food here. I contacted their customer service and they were really kind and helped me with my order immediately which has now encouraged me to go back and try the plate I really wanted in the first place. I owe my appreciation to this place based off of good service!> 'Twas the night before Christmas. And we just finished watching the Blink show at Quincy market. While trying to find a restaurant that was open, we came across Clover.We got there about 45 mins before they closed. We ordered the chickpea fritter sandwich and the fried mushroom. Unfortunately the person behind the counter said fried mushrooms wouldn't be possible for him to make at this time so we couldn't try that. It took about 10 min for the sandwich to be ready - we could actually hear the sizzle of the falafel being fried. We got it home and ate it after a couple of hours but it held up really well. The sandwich had purple cabbage and carrot slaw and hummus with the fried falafel stuffed inside a pita. It was so good! Game to try it again and hopefully their fried mushrooms too, it just sounds so good! Quick mention of the fact that they are quite sustainable. They do serve single use items (which I don't approve of) but at least it's all compostable. Kudos to Clover for taking this initiative, and that too since the time they started in 2010.> Great vegan options. Coffee, teas, juices as well. Prices are very good for Boston. Food comes out super fast. A few small tables to sit at, one big communal table, and a few bar seats in the back. Many pre-made grab-n-go snacks too. Definitely stop by if you need a plant-based meal or drink.> Came right before the lunch rush and it was pretty quiet! I was served quickly and was recommended the chickpea fritter. I also saw their french fries with rosemary, and the lady sold it to me when they say it's fried fresh. I would totally recommend the fritter! As for the fries, I guess it depends if you like skinnier fries. They weren't that crispy, which I would prefer. Rosemary gave it a nice aroma though! The service was great and they even gave me some fries to snack on until my food was ready. I'm totally going back !> Been here twice, and will probably seek out this place every time I am in the Boston area from now on. This is a great stop for a filling, healthy meal. (And they have amazing pour over coffee) I've tried both the Impossible meatball platter and the chickpea fritter platter and they are delicious. This is the best experience I've ever had with impossible meat. The sides were different in the platters for both experiences. I'm not sure if that's a seasonal thing or different per plate, but the first time that I tried the impossible meatball platter, I enjoyed the sides much more.  Pro tip: enjoy your hummus in your platter with warm pita.

The ambiance is absolutely amazing it's perfect for a fancy date night. The service was great our waiter was very knowledgeable, never made us feel rushed and was very timely. Our food and wine was so delicious. For an appetizer we split the Caprese, then for a main I got the Tagliatelle Al Tartufo and my boyfriend got the Penne alla Bolognese. The food was AMAZING!!!! They grated the truffle and Parmesan on my pasta at the table. (Although at other locations they bring out the Parmesan wheel and do table service where they mix the pasta in the wheel)Although worth noting the pasta was 45$ it was amazing but definitely a strictly special occasion type place for me so I would make sure to expect that going into it.> I found the food a tad disappointing. The fusilli and shrimp dish I felt the pasta was underdone. It wasn't al dente with a bite but when I bit into it it felt raw and doughy. The margherita pizza was ok. The crust was thick. Probably the only dish I felt was decent was the orecchiette and the hot baked bread was wonderful. Ami our server was delightful as well! He was super pleasant and I appreciated him. As massive as restaurant is the food was not so impressive.> Not a bad spot to go to if you're in the mood for Italian in the Seaport area.  I was with a group of 5 on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is in the same building as a Regal Cinema, and as a result, it smells like popcorn.  The restaurant is large and decorated nicely.  FYI- they have an entire menu for gluten free options.  For my main dish I ordered the short rib ravioli.  It was good but I wasn't very impressed with it, especially for the price point.  However, the main show stopper of the night was the four cheese truffle ravioli.  This was excellent and if I had to come back, this is the dish I would go with.  Overall, we had a pretty good time here.  Our waiter was friendly and their wine menu was good.  I believe the price point is a bit high for the authenticity and size of the meal you are getting.  I don't feel a burning desire to come back but I am not disappointed I tried it out.> I am a regular at Tuscan, by far one of the best restaurants in the city. All the pastas are amazing and the Bolognese here is the best Bolognese in the entire city. The veal chop and Tomahawk are amazing and always cooked perfectly. The service here is amazing and the bartenders are the best. Always ask for Anjha or Lulu at the bar and they will make your visit here perfect. Nimesh the executive chef is wonderful and always comes around to make sure your meal is cooked perfectly. No other restaurant chef does that. Luis has the largest wine selection and always picks you a great Italian Wine to Pair with your meal. If you haven't visited Tuscan make sure its your next restaurant to visit especially if your in the Seaport!> After my friend and I spent almost an hour trying to find parking in the north end, we decided to head to the seaport instead. A parking garage was located in the building next to this restaurant. There are several locations, and this is the first time I tried this place. I was craving pasta and we got it! Order the bolognes (sp?) and my friend had the lobster linguine. I def wanted to eat his instead! It was very flavorful and creamy. While I enjoyed my dish, it was a bit too salty and lacked more of a richer flavor for my taste. I'd order the same dish at Eataly for half the price.As for the seating, tons of seating options, which can be a rarity in Boston.","5, 3, 3, 5, 4"

You get two slices for what the price of one would be and the options are amazing. To name a few there are options of Meatlovers, Old School, Veggie Buffalo Chicken, Chicken Ranch, and my personal favorite so far Sausage Pepper and Onion. Service is efficient and the price is about $5 so pretty unbeatable. As far as cons....have yet to find any!> I've been here twice so far... is it the best pizza I've ever had? No. Still, don't let that distract you from the fact that it's still darn good, and a great value to boot! Haters gonna hate, but it is downtown Boston, so I think the price is reasonable.I've had to opportunity to try the cheeseburger and  Margherita pizzas.I will repeat what all most all of the other people have stated: The ""slices"" or a quarter of a pizza, and a large one at that. At the same time the pizza is thin, so you're not left feeling bloated or as if you've overeaten. Being thin also helps keep the tomato sauce, cheese, and crust somewhat in balance. To be fair, though, I would have preferred a little more cheese and tomato sauce, as is the case with Neapolitan pizza.A note regarding heft, I found the cornicione (edges) too big relative to the rest of the pizza. Furthermore, they weren't exciting enough to warrant being eaten almost like a breadstick, and I'm not one of those people who leaves pizza crusts uneaten. An option of dipping sauce would be great! Toppings were pretty good! The cheese was solid, and the tomato sauce definitely tasted ""real"", and not from a can. With both the Margherita and cheeseburger, the quantity was spot on. The slices were neither weighed down, nor did they experience a dearth of toppings. My gripe, however, is regarding the cheeseburger.Tomato sauce, especially when it's real has a fair bit of acidity. Pickles by themselves are fine, but added to a pizza created a very high acid content. My advice is to simplify, and allow fresh ingredients shine on their own: especially onions, lettuce, maybe tomato slices. Finally, those dang slices... I'm a guy who likes to mix it up. Allowing actual slices (1/8th instead of 1/4) would allow me to do more of what I love: mixing and matching. On the other hand,they'd lose the title of largest slice, and I don't want to be the one telling Ernesto's how to run their shop. A solution would be to bring some friends to come with! Who's down?Overall, if you're looking for piping hot fresh amazing pizza, this may not be your best bet. On the other hand, if you're looking for something quick, yummy, filling, and a great value, then this is your place. The slices reheat quick, come on down (and take me with you)!> I had seen a sign suspended above the road that read ""Boston's largest slice"" so I figured I had to try it. Verdict: Delicious pizza! One ""slice"" is the size of 1/4th of the pie. My favorite is the sausage and ricotta pizza; absolutely delicious and perfectly balanced. Service is quick. The pizza is thinner with a thicker crust. The restaurant is small, but does have a few tables.> Amazing pizza in Little Italy. One slice of pizza is huge and is actually two slices. The cheese and sauce mixed well, nothing to overwhelming or too much of something. The service is very quick and welcoming, it does get crowded however! The crust was a little too bready/dough like to be eaten. And it would be a good idea to put on napkin containers on each table. What a steal! Yum!> A hole in the wall pizza joint with savory pizzas sold by the slice. The cheese on it reminded me of the amazing Nagila pizza in L.A.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

Of course we had to get the plain cheese, his go to, to really be able to taste the sauce and cheese. We got lucky and they just started baking a fresh cheese, we waited maybe 10 minutes and was it worth the wait... probably my favorite pizza in Boston so far! The crust was my favorite part, thin and crispy and holds up in the middle... wow I'm salivating right now thinking of  it My fiancé thought it needed some salt, but otherwise amazing!The staff was wicked friendly and seemed proud of their product.

Delivery service is rather fast. The vegetable accompaniments are much too ordinary - chopped up lettuce, with a bit of tomatoes.The white sauce is fascinating - what's in it? It's good!> Location is small but very busy since it's located right by the nightclub scene. We stopped by around 10:30 pm and the line was pretty long. The employees were all friendly and talkative since they knew my friend.. It was my first time in, so I was excited to see what they had to offer. I went with the grilled chicken plate with everything on top. The food was great and the grilled chicken was delicious! Everything was fresh! Prices are reasonable and the food is good! Oh and yes definitely fellll right in love with the white sauce! Yumm!> These folks come into my office every once in awhile and it's one of the best pop ups that comes into office. It's worth all the rage imo. The folks that come in provide great service  and the food is great. Falafels runs out so fast so we definitely have to line up early.

Nice and moist to go along with the hummus.If you're looking for some heat, red sauce will bring the heat. It's HOT and I have high tolerance. The hot sauce taste great as well. The white sauce brings a bit of sweetness to offer a balance taste. Enjoy.> So happy they are now in Boston. Love the original in New York, but this location is upto par with NY. Also love how we can add additional toppings (onions, peppers, etc). The food is always consistent in quality and quantity, and fresh.

Not following how there could be 1 and 2 star reviews here.  I recommend going at an ""off time"" - Hubby and I did not have a reservation on a game night so we walked over for late lunch/early dinner.  Greeted by super friendly staff who were gearing up for a busy evening.  We had a number of different waiters come by throughout the meal and all were pleasant and prompt.  After they brought the amazing sourdough and olives by, we started with fresh mozzarella and tomato special which was creamy and delicious (Caprese is the key to getting through a New England winter IMO.)  Hubby had veal parm which he polished off.  Now let's discuss the heaven that was on my plate - please order the ""Rosette Al Montasio Ed Olio Di Tartufo"" (Homemade wide noodle cooked with Prosciutto, Montassio Cheese, Mushrooms & finished in Tomato Cream Sauce with Truffle Oil) because WOW.  One of the tastiest things to ever enter my mouth.  Freshest pasta, the perfect consistency, loaded with flavor and YUM.  For dessert enjoyed lemon ice served in frozen lemon ""cups""- tangy and cool.  Absolutely pleasurable meal in every way.> To be honest, I'm shocked to see this restaurant with such  high reviews. Unfortunately our experience did not go that way.It was approaching 9:30pm on Saturday night when we arrived, and with the kitchen closing at 10pm, the host did warn us that we would need to make a quick decision about our entrees, which we were fine with.We started the meal with the Scallops Limoncello. I'm a huge fan of scallops, and we eat them often, so was excited to try the unique dish. These were grossly overcooked and the Limocello sauce was sweet like candy. We didn't finish them.For entrees, my boyfriend got Linguine Alle Vongole and I got Shrimp Scampi. In both dishes the pasta was overcooked; both dishes were overall underwhelming in flavor. The only good part of the meal was the bread and olive oil to start.Another reviewer mentioned that the restaurant could use some charm and modernity. Completely agree. We felt rushed and overlooked, and the establishment was quite dated.   We left disappointed.Perhaps we caught them on a bad night. In a neighborhood where I imagine it's quite a competitive market for Italian food, I would recommend you take your business elsewhere.> Wow haven't had such amazing Italian food in forever. I swear someone's grandmother was in the kitchen making the sauce/gravy the meatballs and the fresh homemade pasta. For a work dinner it was bit late but we missed all the game crowd.  Jamie was our server full of amazing suggestions.  I didn't even check if you need a reservation but if so make one. We had meatballs and burrata as an appetizer to kill for! Suggested lobster ravioli melt in your mouth goodness! Also had another homemade pasta with mushrooms and cheese and divine! Seriously blew all eating rules with that dinner but was well worth it!> Great little authentic Italian restaurant. Waiters were very attentive and helpful with their recommendations. I had the Veal Saltimbocca and was very impressed. The sauce was perfect. House wine was of good quality. I had the Sangiovese. Good pours. Overall, I wish that I could give a 4.5 star rating.> We were on the hunt to find an Italian restaurant in Boston which had a good Spaghetti & Meatball Dinner.  We needed to find something close close to where we were at the time and stumbled across Limoncello Ristorante.It was about 4:20pm on a Sunday and the Restaurant only had a couple tables with people so we were seated immediately.  Our server was very friendly and brought our our drinks.  She also brought out complimentary bread with a side plate of olives and olive oil.  The olives were tasty but the bread crust was a little burned and hard.The four of us all ordered Spaghetti & Meatball Dinners.  The portions were very large that we could have actually shared 2 dinners between us.  While the meatballs were tasty and a decent size, the sauce was more starchy then what we expected.Our server was very attentive and constantly filling up our water glasses and checked in periodically if we needed anything.Overall Service was 4 stars and Food (Spaghetti & Meatballs) 3 stars.","5, 2, 5, 4, 3"

The vibe is perfect for that young professional under 40 crowd that wants to hear good music at a level where you can hold a conversation. It's the idea location to chat with friends, go on a date, or chill with friends and try to meet people. IMPRESSIVE: The key to Drink is they don't have a drink menu. You show up and describe a feeling, a region of the world, a base liquor, a type of flavor, etc. and the mixologist makes a drink. For example, ""back in the day"" I used to say a city (Paris, London, New Orleans, Madrid, Seoul) and the mixologist would make a drink that fits the place.  This time I just wanted remixes of Moscow Mule. So they made a citrus version with tequila and a grapefruit version with vodka. It's the only place I've ever been like it. Popular: given how cool the vibe and custom drinks are ... it's always packed. We showed up at 7 and got lucky we only had to wait 5 minutes to get in. When we left at 9, there was a line with 20-25 people waiting to get in. While it's popular, it isn't a TOO PACKED. They do a great job of controlling the flow of people in and out to keep it so that people can move around without pumping in to people. Pro tip: grab a drink at drink then go upstairs and get dinner at their sister/brotha restaurant. Pro tip: GET THE FRIES! they are amazing a surprisingly feeling. They are cut thick and long and have the perfect amount of salt and seasoning.> Love Love this place.The absolute best cocktail bar in Boston. Came here with some friends on Saturday night and had an incredible time. The line was long but it moved pretty quick. We were escorted to spot near the bar where we were greeted immediately by a bartender. He asked us what we like and all three drinks he knocked it out of the park.  My friend also got the fries and man they were good. The drinks are expensive but absolutely worth it.We will be back!!!> Love this hipster bar! My husband and I had a great time,good drinks,very knowledgeable and the most experienced bartenders I've met! The interior: exposed bricks/industrial vibe LOVE IT Great ambiance for a low key date, or to even start your date off. Love the concept,tell them what you like or normally drink and they will create something PHENOMENAL for you!!! I've had the BEST old fashion here! Don't expect a full menu, just a nice elevated bar. Perfect date night spot! You will see me here again.> Drinks were okay, just okay. Simple concept of a bar without the crowding or mess. Staff was attentive all night and super friendly. Really cant go wrong trying this place out. Simple, clean, neat, and inexpensive. Worth stopping in.> I am already planning on my next visit to Drink and it honestly cannot wait to come back. Located downstairs under Sportello, the space has 2 bars with seating as well as a couple of tall tables. This place is known for creating their own drinks, so you tell them what your preferences are and they make the magic happen. If you prefer whiskey - they got you covered there too. They also have a pretty good variety for bar food. Highlight for me was the duck taco's and the burger . Also ordered their devilled eggs, chicken wings and steak tartare, which were all well presented and great for sharing. Service was spot on too with the bartenders checking in, keeping water glasses topped off and keeping the food flowing.","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

Yes, it's overpriced, but you're at a restaurant at North Station in downtown Boston with Guy Fieri's face plastered all over it. Don't tell me you didn't expect it.2. It's loud as hell but that's part of the vibe! If you're not looking for that kind of energy it's not really for you.Anyway ...Our server Diana was the best. She was quick, knowledgeable, patient and very sweet and her recommendations were on point. The Trash Can Nachos were presented in a fun way and the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. I was fortunate to not run into the soggy/cold chip issue that a number of other people have run into. Our chips were crispy, warm and tasty.The Molcajete de Carne y Marisco was also an excellent choice. Instead of getting a bunch of different tacos we opted to split this sizzling hot vat of turf, sea and cheese and it was a great decision. It was beautiful and delicious. The two sides that we chose (Mexican Fried Rice and Barbacoa Cauliflower) were great and a perfect compliment to the main.I would definitely go back with friends, though Lolita is still my favorite taco spot.> We were excited to come here, as my sister loves Guy. I was with a group of 4 girls. We ordered 2 margs and 2 other cocktails while we waited to sit at the bar to order food. The 2 cocktails were not made right, they were just straight up a mix of sugar and water. The margs were all sugar, with what tasted like no tequila, and in a plastic cup... for $15 each. When we asked the bartender to get a different drink, she was really unhappy. We were not rude at all. She gave my two friends another drink and that was it. I chalked it up to them just opening and maybe they will get more experienced staff.But, I will say, the nachos are great. The display and the whole show of it was cool. I would only come back for those. The queso or whatever is on them it amazing. Overall good nachos, poor drinks, not so friendly or happy to be there staff.> Not impressed at all. The chips looked freshly made, but they were cold. The salsa we ordered was overly creamy; tasting like they dumped a jar of cream cheese or sour cream in it. The cheese burger tacos were decent, but came out basically at room temperature. My drink was too sweet so you can tell the juice isn't fresh. Wouldn't go back again.> I love Guy's vibe and this restaurant is super cool, but I was generally unimpressed by the menu overall. The staff was fantastic though - everyone was super friendly and answered all our questions. We did get there right as they opened so we didn't have any trouble finding seating, but it did fill up pretty fast beginning around 5. The trash can nachos are the best thing on the menu - I thought they would be overhyped, but they weren't. I'd return for those nachos alone. My margarita was underwhelming - not strong at all and just generally lacked in flavor. The guacamole was the same way. It came with nacho strips which were a great idea for dipping, but the batches were hit or miss. Some were hot and crunchy, some were colder and oily. The prices are also a little steep for the area, so that's not encouraging me to run back any time soon.Overall, the vibe is fun and the nachos are as good as everyone says - I got a few great pictures inside, but I think I'll be returning to some other restaurants when I need a Tex-Mex fix.> Honestly, quite surprised at how much I liked the place. Not sure what I was expecting, but the space is really nicely furnished. I have no idea how to describe it to someone, but I loved the street art mixed with some industrial with some hints of gothic feels to it. We just went for drinks and got some snacks, but the drinks are pretty expensive. They were experimental and fun. The snacks we ordered, trash can nachos and lettuce wraps were good, but at that price point, I think were a little too expensive. I would recommend this place for a fun drink date because of the ambiance is awesome and the drinks are great, but food maybe elsewhere.","4, 2, 2, 3, 3"

For the most part fast service and pleasant.> A very straight-forward and simple menu to choose from. Perfect for people who can never decide what they want to eat. For this place, I ordered the combo mix rice plate (chicken & gyro). The chicken was a little dry and the gyro tasted fine. There was a large portion of rice under the meat. I did feel the rice to meat ration was a bit uneven (too much rice). Next time, I would opt to try their salad plate. I appreciate that all the sauce options were on the side. The sauce did help with the dry chicken. In particular, the mint sauce tasted the best. It felt refreshing for a hot Boston day. Only complaint for this place was the bathroom. I was told that the bathroom was broken that day. So I guess staff and guests didn't get to use the bathroom that day.> White sauce all the way! I just can't get over how shredded the chicken is though compared to places in NYC. Nice yellow rice. Crisp lettuce. Portion size to price is a bit expensive too. $7 for a small. Service is spectacular. Get all the sauces! Solid spot if you want that heavy white sauce goodness.> Garlic cream tasty , please cook your rice well.  It's extremely hard to chew and almost not boiled cooked rice. 2 star for your garlic cream sauce taste , rest is not tasty at all.Specially rice is so hard.

I tried one of the berry-themed smoothies, and finished the whole thing in record time.The ingredients are fresh and the portions are absolutely massive (hence why ""healthy"" is in quotes, you're not actually going to save on calories here). Staff is very friendly, and the items are prepared right in front of you, so you can see the standards they have for their ingredients and their cleanliness.Prices were a little higher than I was expecting, but I suppose that's the cost of having fresh ingredients and such gigantic portion sizes. I would definitely treat myself to another smoothie here, especially once the weather warms up again!> I like to look at this place, I guess I put the eyes in Energeyes.I like the Acai from here but I don't love it, which can be said about the majority of Acai in the country honestly (the Brazilians do it right, the Americans not so much), and it could definitely be better.Also, the prices are so annoyingly high that it cost them another star, but I decided to bump them back up from 3 to 4 because they've always been really friendly and some other places in this part of Boston aren't. Plus their rent must be very high being in such a popular college area.But for Acai in Boston, nothing comes close to the authentic Brazilian taste at Oasis Bakery.> I've been dropping by fairly frequently after I started on a heavily modified version of Tom Brady's diet after gyming (I will eat like trash at some point in the day). Coincidentally enough, the TB12 book is also on display here along with other healthy eating books. This place is going to be pricey but that seems to be a trend for any juice bar - this place is no exception. However, the drinks that I have tried here are very good. I recommend Fuel and Post Recovery Shake for post-workout drinks while Coffee Lover is great if you also need to stay awake for the rest of the day. The mint from the Fuel drink does take some getting used to because the drink has mint, which gives a very grassy aftertaste. Regardless, I am definitely coming back here.IG: Mood4foodeatery> I go for the salad bowls, which are huge and a great variety of ingredients. The quality is worth the cost. The staff is very friendly and happy to accommodate dietary restrictions.

My review is a bit skewed as I am solely basing it off the hot chocolate flights, but boy what a treat!The restaurant is two floors - it has a nice bar downstairs that wasn't too crowded on a Saturday afternoon. The hot chocolate flights can be spiked or not spiked - depending on your preference! I chose the spiked option and was not disappointed!Personally, the peppermint candy cane and smores hot chocolates were my favorite, but all were delicious! One option tasted like spiked eggnog - the other had a delicious churro on top with a white chocolate base. I will say, I recommend going hungry because these are VERY filling. The only bit of slight negative feedback is the service - it is rather slow but we did not mind whatsoever - we preferred to relax with our drinks. If you're in a rush, you may have some issues, but nothing crazy.P.S. the flights are very instagramable if you're looking for that!> As part of our festive tour of Boston this past Christmas, we wanted to include a warm treat and saw that Hot Chocolate Flights were highlighted at the Met Back Bay. We called and made reservations a few weeks in advance since we were a large group. That was no problem and we were excited for the chocolate adventure to come, but we had a change in our group number and had to make a second call to update reservation. We were then told that they didn't take reservations and that whomever we talked to was wrong to put the reservation in. Despite our misgivings and the somewhat disconcerting conversation, we decided to still go and try our luck getting a seat since it was a weekday.We arrived and were told we did have a reservation (confusing, but understandable if they've recently seen staffing changes and need to update everyone on the current policy) and were seated right away. Everything was going smoothly until we tried to put in our order for the hot chocolate flights.There are four different flavors including Classic, Pumpkin, Peppermint, and Coconut. Some in our group wanted all four flavors, but others wanted only a couple of flavors. We asked if we could order flights with the same number of drinks, but switch up the flavors. Our server didn't know and asked the manger. The manager rushed by and abruptly told us no. She didn't explain why or even ask if there were any dietary issues. I'm not sure if it was something in how they make the flights or if the kitchen can't customize orders since they are holiday specials. For a moment of her time, the manager could have let us know why the flights couldn't be adjusted instead of brushing us off.All in all, the flights were delicious. You could 'Liquor them up' and add different types of spirits to the drink. The presentation was great and we ordered some seasonal cookies just to add a bit more sugar to the equation! Food and drinks were great, but the customer service left us feeling a bit off put.> My girlfriend surprised us and brought us to the met back bay for a hOt chocolate flight. I have to say that the spiked hot chocolate flight was delicious. My husband got the regular hot chocare flight and it was ok. I am giving this place a 4 start because we couldn't just have the flights without ordering food. Didn't love that we had to buy food!> Went for the flatbread Sunday and let me just say, I'm very into a good flatbread! This was more just pizza, a thicker/chewier flatbread rather than thin and crisp but still very very tasty!! Why cut it into 5 pieces though? Why make my boyfriend and I stare at the last slice with a silent battle for the pizza? But very good. I've had their bloody Mary's many many times as well which are out of this world and I blame for a big part of my brunch addiction! Only thing is they run out of whole drinks, early in the night. We went at 6 pm and were told that they were out of the kind of white wine we ordered for the day? Which seems weird for such a nice spot. But nonetheless, a great place!> Unfortunate there is nothing to rave about at MET.  The best part of the meal is the service.  Friendly and personable.  The food is very ordinary.  Brick chicken was not flat, but like a normal breast of chicken.  It was fine, but a little over cooked and dry.  The other dishes were simple and nothing special.  The wine list is pretty good.","5, 3, 4, 4, 2"

Will be back and try something else.> If you are looking for a quick place to get your Mexican food fix over lunch, this is one of the best in Boston.  Has a great burrito and burrito bowl, and one of the best quesadillas that I have found in the area.  Portions are very generous but be wary, the line can get rather long right around 12-1 so plan accordingly.  There also isn't any seating in the restaurant so either take what you have back to work or grab it to go and eat in post office square a block away in a nice day.> Tried it per my coworkers' recommendations. It's conveniently near downtown where I work. I imagine it gets crowded during peak lunch hours but they seem to be quite efficient with preparing the food. I came at 3pm so it was rather empty as you can imagine. This was by far the best burrito I've ever had in Boston and will definitely be coming back for lunch, especially it's under $10 for a bomb ass burrito! The workers are also super chill and friendly> Hands down the best lunch spot in Boston if you are looking for quality Mexican style fare.  Carnitas, Chicken, Shrimp are all great as is the Veggie.  The Burrito Bowl is a great value and very tasty.  No one has ever regretted trying this place.Please bring the food truck back in Dewey Square!11/10> Quick and easy lunch, I stopped in to Sabroso and the queue would through the rope lines and was just about to be out onto the street. That's a good sign for any restaurant.Simple enough menu with burritos, bowls, tacos, quesadillas and salads with a variety of different proteins and toppings. I wasn't feeling especially creative so I got a chicken burrito. When the guy asked what I wanted on it, I said, ""All the way"" and that apparently includes cheese, rice, beans, pico de gallo, hot sauce, crema and guacamole. When I unwrapped it back at the apartment, it was still hot and the stuff had melded together a bit so that I wasn't just having ""bite of rice"" and ""bite of beans"" and such. Tasty and the hot sauce was only a little hot and not overwhelming.Even though there were 20 people in line ahead of me, the wait to place my order wasn't even five minutes. And for less than $10? A bargain.","5, 5, 5, 5, 4"

It's a dive bar and it knows it. The decorations and environment are an acquired taste. I love it in there, but my mom described it as ""that dark bar"" by Newbury. It's true. The food is pretty okay, but considering how much you get for how cheap it is it's absolutely worth it. The deals are also perfect. My particular favorite is sliders. Also get 3 because 4 is begging for a stomach ache. The beer and drinks are perfectly above average. This is the place you'd go for a few cheap drinks before going to Earl's or something for an easy going night.> I usually come here for food and drinks since it's close by work. Food here is typical bar grub and they serve a wide variety which is nice. Come early to grab seating as the place gets packed frequently and it isn't really a standing place. There is a downstairs as well that they sometimes open up which has more seating.Submitting one star because they did not bring me my food after waiting over an hour. Somehow my five other co workers got their food while my order was mysteriously lost. Also even more strange is that I ordered the same thing as 3 of them (chicken fingers) and my order was the only one to get lost so be careful of that happening sometimes. Waitress was not apologetic but at least they didn't force me to pay for food I never got. Maybe they were afraid I had the Corona virus.> One of the best of its kind, pour house is a dive bar done well.Our last stop for the night, we came in and had one titos and soda each, and shared the steak tips and eggs. First off, who serves steak tips and eggs at 1am? That's the first positive check they had. The food was also very good, we were pleasantly surprised.Their late night menu is extremely extensive, with breakfast options as well as burgers, sandwiches, and more. The extensive menu and long hours (8am-2am!) set the place apart, but for a late night drink, it's a more simple dive bar.> Late night bar food that hits the spot. Although we didn't have a drink here we did have some really tasty nachos. Sans the black olives and salsa. We got there around 12:30, their kitchen closes at 1:30. They have a variety of late night options as well. Totally casual vibe as well.> Solid 3 star experience. My husband and I stopped in SPECIFICALLY for the tator tot poutine. I have a love affair with poutine and tots are my jimmy jam. We were excited. Until I saw there was fried shrimp on the menu. I didn't see it on the menu online! We asked if the tots were fried in the same frier as the shrimp. Crush my soul they are. While I do carry an epi pen everywhere I go, I prefer not to use it. We asked about the chips for the nachos and those do not go in the frier. So we ordered the chicken nachos. We also each ordered a drink. My husband got the harpoon IPA and I got a mule. The IPA was absolutely the wrong beer. I tried it and could tell right away it wasn't the harpoon IPA. My husband asked the individual what beer it was they dropped off and they didn't know, so they checked the ticket and said ""harpoon IPA."" My husband let them know it didn't taste right and she looked at him for a second and then walked off. He'll just drink that beer then I guess? My mule was super meh. I drank less than half of it. Life is too short to drink bad drinks. When the nachos arrived I was pleased. Nice large pile, no shellfish. Can't complain. I thought the chicken was seasoned nicely and enjoyed the snack. My husband was less pleased but if he wants to share his opinion he can write his own yelp review! Lol. Anyway, I wouldn't come back here of my own accord but wouldn't put up a fight if friends insisted on coming here.","4, 1, 4, 3, 3"

The clam chowder was superb, the Brussels sprouts were INCREDIBLE, and the wine was exquisite. The owner Joe let us try new foods for the upcoming menus, and boy let me say the customers are in for a treat soon!!For my main course, I had gnocchi with short rib. Joe said it best when I asked him about it: if you are a fan of short rib, this is going to the best dish on the menu. The meat was so tender but not undercooked, and the gnocchi + sauce they used were absolutely amazing.> Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 4.0/5.0Value: 2.5/5.0Decor: 3.5/5.0Overall: 4.0/5.0Great food, very good service.  Just forget that its at the corner of a Hilton.  Would come back, though I would also say that the 4.5 Yelp*s as of Sept 2019 set my expectations a bit high.> My husband & I were meeting my in-laws for dinner before a Bruins game last night. The first restaurant we chose, when we walked in we knew immediately that they wouldn't enjoy the atmosphere. I canceled that reservation and quickly looked at yelp to see if there was any reservations walking distance nearby. Luckily I found Fin Point!!! By the pictures I could tell it would be a better atmosphere for my in laws.When we walked in we were pleasantly surprised, it was very beautiful! It also wasn't crowded at all, I think we just missed the Saturday night dinner crowd. We were immediately seated 20 minutes before our reservation time in a private back area that was half booth, have chairs. They gave us the drink menu and the lunch menu since it was before 4. We asked if we could wait until 4 so we could have the dinner choices, they happily agreed. As an app we ordered the $1 oysters special. I didn't eat any but my family loved them. My mother in law and I had the apple sangria which was perfect, it tasted like fall! I also ordered a cup of New England clam chowder to start with was delicious. For dinner I ordered the Faro Island Salmon and it was really tasty. I loved the carrot/sweet potato purée that it came with. Everyone else loved their dishes as well. I also have to add that we had fantastic service. I'm so sorry but I forget our waiters name, but he was fantastic. My father in law ordered a hamburger and our waiter informed us that the cooks had accidentally overcooked his burger so they were making a new one. We wanted to wait until his plate came to eat and I think he may have noticed that so they took it off the bill which we greatly appreciated!! Excellent experience all around.> This has been my go to bar in the financial district for business and pleasure for a number of years now. Located inside the Hilton this restaurant can fit for almost any occasion. The tables have enough space between them for privacy if needed as well. Come in on any given weekday for lunch and you'll see plenty of suits, deals being brokered, and networking. After work you get a mix of business travelers and local professionals. If you want a great after work bar that doesn't have a college vibe this is it. The bartender Katie is also great! This place probably has the best staff in the financial district. I've never even had a mediocre experience. I wish I could shout all the great staff here by name.In an area overrun with Irish dive bars the food here is impeccable without being overly adventurous. You'll find a mix of sandwiches, including a pretty awesome burger. You can't go wrong with their tacos or flatbreads either. Menu changes seasonally so there is always something new.> Nicely decorated and romantic lighting for NYE dinner. Probably wouldn't have chosen this place if I knew it was in the Hilton (don't love going to hotel restaurants), but overall it was very nice. We were only given and told about the NYE menu when we were sat, so we didn't know they were also serving their regular dinner menu. The set 3 course menu was good, but wouldn't have ordered from it if we would have known. This was upsetting since it was also my birthday, but at least our server was nice and removed our desserts from the check. Service was as expected for fine dining with someone continuously filling our water, topping off our wine glasses, and taking away plates. The oysters were good with a nice champagne mignonette, but the onions made it a little strong. The halibut and crab entree was delicious. My bf enjoyed the roasted tenderloin entree. Lastly the cherry cheesecake was decadent and I only needed a little bit of the cherries for each bite of cheesecake, otherwise it was too tart. A little too pricey IMO.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The decor is old school. Black and white checkered floor tiles, chrome and red leather seats, Formica tabletops, good solid food and plenty of it, a few frou-frou specials (I'm looking at you, Creme Brulee French Toast), and a waitress named Flo who has been there since God lived next door. (The church is now condos, like everything else in Southie.) (Okay, I don't really know if her name was Flo. I didn't ask but she re-filled my coffee at least three times, which his why I'm writing this review after midnight.)Decor: five stars.Service: five stars.Food: five stars.Hollandaise Sauce: three stars.Everything was good. We showed up hungry on a Wednesday morning near ten a.m. We were greeted immediately and offered any vacant seat in the house, which was about 75% of the many tables. We chose a booth in the back, knowing we were going to want to talk for a while. The table was clean (no syrup or grime or stray anything) and the server arrived immediately with menus and an offer of coffee, which I accepted. My date had his own coffee, something he'd purchased on the way to pick me up, but that was no problem. It's a very chill place. As soon as I asked for coffee, there it was. And when we asked for suggestions, Flo was forthright and helpful. She came back a few times, as we perused the menu. Gotta love being treated kindly. We're not regulars and yet we were made to feel at home. The food was ample. Home fries were really good. I've been to diners where they resemble packing peanuts. Not these, they were probably oven cooked or maybe deep-fried -- I didn't ask -- but crispy and tasty and discrete. I ate more than I should have! My date got the #5: two eggs, bacon, home fries, and French toast. For a couple bucks more, he could have had the infamous creme Brulee French toast (which is exactly what it sounds like), but he didn't want that level of sweetness. He was very happy with his meal. I got the eggs Benedict, my go-to for breakfast. The ham was amazing: thick and fried and juicy. More ham than Canadian bacon, which is okay by me. The eggs were slightly overcooked but still runny-enough. The Hollandaise sauce was good but not nearly as tart as it should be. More lemon, please! I added Tobasco for zing. Between 4 and 5 stars, one small slip -- not enough lemon in the sauce -- isn't enough to lower the rating. This diner hits all the marks. Good coffee, good service, good decor, good food, lots of food. Oh, and not very pricey. Our tab was less than twenty bucks.One block from the Broadway stop on the T. Plenty of street parking. I can't believe it took me as long as it did to visit Mul's.> Rumor had it that Mul's Diner was going to close and move into their sister restaurant across the street - Amherin's.  Well, I checked in with our waitress and was informed that the deal had fell through.  Good news, since I just had the creme brulee french toast again, and really enjoyed it.I ordered up the House Special #5 $7.95 since it offered the creme brulee upgrade for $9.95 (two eggs, French toast, home fries, bacon or sausage, served with coffee).  A DC was up for halvsies with me, so we also got #6 $8.95 Belgian waffle with fresh strawberries, and served with bacon or sausage.  A little Q&A found me out that I could opt for tea instead of coffee, and we added a side of their corned beef hash $4.95 after my teeny taste of another DC's #3 lured me in.Tip: Mul's Giant Waffle = #6's Belgian Waffle, which makes it $2.50 for the coffee ($2.50/$2.75) and the bacon/sausage ($3.25) (3 pieces as part of the combo).Tip 2: Creme Brulee French toast plate $7.95 comes with 3 pieces.  The combo comes with 2 pieces.My #5 arrived on two dishes.  The one of french toast pleasingly creme bruleed and dabbed with whipped cream was satisfyingly filled.  The second plate of eggs over easy, home fries, and 3 bacon strips was plated quite casually and seemed a bit scant.  Our portion of hash was acceptable for the price, and a lot less oily than another recent (yet pleasantly warmed) version at an establishment north of the river Charles, but my initial taste of it from a friend's plate was the best.At $15 for my share, it was a good price for brunch.Head's up - their bathroom was freezing.> What a great combo between 5am-9am in the weekdays a breakfast platter with eggs, potatoes and your choice of bacon or sausage with coffee and 2 toasts for about $6, it doesn't get any better than that. Service was very friendly for being super early and she was efficient and remembered everything. The food was delicious but I want to remind you that it is CASH ONLY!> Popular down-to-earth neighborhood diner in Southie. Prices are excellent and portions are decent. I got the #5 combo with the creme brûlée upgrade. The over-easy eggs had the perfect consistency. French toast was very interesting in flavor, the custard was very good on its own, not too sweet. If you don't like too much custard, don't worry, it is easy to remove. My partner got the steak and eggs. The teak was over cooked (no juiciness left, just felt like eating protein) but a NY strip for $12 is still a good deal. Service was incredibly attentive. From the moment we sat down, waitress brought everything we could possibly want like hot sauces and ketchup over.  She checked up on us often, refilled coffee. It feels like all the staff really care about this place. During their down time, waitresses take the time to wipe down the laminated menus.> We were visiting my daughter who was doing a show at the convention center. We live in NY and enjoyed the food at a real neighborhood diner with no frills but great food for the price!","5, 4, 4, 4, 3"

The seats swivel and the smells wafting over the divider are splendid, so we were happy with our seating.The fries are solid and the oyster baos are incredible. The oyster is so soft and the garnish is light and complementary. Best of all, they used the right baos! The rotating special menu for the night had a green tea gin-based drink so I was one happy girl. And the rest of their cocktail menu looked fantastic. Can't wait to return to try it all!> I was really taken a back. I wish I could give this place more stars. AMAZING! The environment is a refuge just as the name says. A first it looked pretentious but after being warmly greeted by the host and the friendly nature of the staff I immediately felt at home. The FOOD is incredible... from the baos to the Cinnamon Toast Mochi. All the food was perfectly timed, precise temperature and pretty enough time take a picture! Mary was our server and she is AMAZING! Incredibly friendly and had insight on the food and history of the restaurant. I would absolutely recommend this place and will be back myself!> A very unique concept with impressive decor and cool, fusion menu. I came here on a Sunday night and there were many tables available, although the place was still bustling. I came here because I was intrigued by the Asian fusion menu, which had a good amount of vegetarian options. I'm so glad I did because I tried food items I never would've experienced somewhere else! My boyfriend and I shared the Kung Pao dumplings, the BFC baos, the avocado baos, and the Sage and Garlic Udon noodles. They brought out each item one by one, so the first item we tried was the avocado baos. They were 2 baos each filled with 1 medium sized piece of fried avocado, some sriracha aioli, and greens. I was a little disappointed with the amount of filling in the baos, they could've added another piece of avocado in my opinion. However, after taking the first bite I was so pleased with our decision to order them! The mayo was perfectly spicy which complemented the mild, fatty avocado, with a crunch from the fried breading. The bao itself was fluffy and warm, like a pillow for my mouth. There was a hint of sweetness in it, which I was confused about initially, but very grateful for the sweetness when it was in the BFC. Which brings me to our 2nd food item--the BFC baos. I was so excited for them, but unfortunately could not get over the spice level. It seemed as though they added a dry spice to the chicken after it had been fried, which made the kick particularly painful. The mayo and greens in this bao were not enough to counteract the spiciness. Not even the sweet-ish bao was enough. My spice tolerance is around average to slightly above average, so for this one piece of chicken in the bao to cause me to have tears and a runny nose means that the BFC is not for the faint of heart. If only there was a warning in the menu. Hopefully, my warning saves some of you from the discomfort. The 3rd item we got was the Kung pao dumplings. There are 4 decent sized dumplings in a spicy chili sauce. They were really good! Nothing spectacular, but also my mouth was numb from the BFC so I can't say for sure how it tasted. Cool relief arrived with our Sage-Garlic Udon noodles. They are chilled, not warm, which we didn't know from the menu. The portion size was also very generous. My first bite was heavenly. The noodles were so fresh and flavorful, coated with a sweet sage sauce, microgreens, little mushrooms, and a peanut topping. There were around 10 tiny fried potato pieces, and when I popped one in my mouth it was a flavor explosion. I'm not sure how, but Banyan managed to infuse so much complexity into 1 noodle dish. I also ordered the lychee-lemongrass soda, which was delicious!! It was on the sweet side, and more lychee heavy. Highly recommend. Onto the service--amazing, amazing! There was a sense of pride in their food that easily came across, which is refreshing. Many people have talked about the beautiful tree and vine themed decor, and I agree that it is very cool! Overall, we left full and satiated, however, the BFC baos traumatized us a little bit. This is the reason that I cannot give Banyan 5 stars. I will be back, however, and just not order the BFC baos--then I know I'll have a 5 star experience.> This place was busy and fun!! Drinks were good, apps were good. Would go again. Ambiance was nice too!!!> First of all, this place is so gorgeous. The decorations are stunning and I was obsessed with the birds nest lights. My friend and I split an appetizer of pork belly buns, which were so delightful. They were full of flavor, texture, and the pickles were a true testament to the goal of Asian fusion. We also each got the noodle soup, which was fabulously warm and tasty. Definitely would come back!","4, 5, 4, 5, 4"

All you can smell is truffle..$14 Dashi Niku - soft boiled egg was deliciousNotes: Water self served. There's only 8 seats inside. Restaurant connected to tiki rock.> I just came back from Japan and was craving ramen so stopped by Oisa for lunch - so maybe it's not a fair comparison but I was very disappointed with the tonkotsu broth, it was more salty than it had flavor. The noodle texture were pretty good; not too soggy or overly hard. The pork slices were also soft and not charred and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately the broth is a very important part of a good ramen and I just was not pleased with the lack of pork flavor in the soup. This place is vegetarian friendly as they have quite a few of options for veggie ramen - maybe that is their speciality so I might have to try one of those instead ...It is also a small space so large groups will probably be difficult- service was pretty good except it took a while for our food and they realized after a while that we still didn't have our ramen so then it came out a few minutes later so it probably doesn't usually take as long but they must've forgotten our order.> My husband and I are such huge ramen fans. After living in Hawaii and traveling to Japan multiple times, we feel like we've basically tasted every ramen, and have high expectations on what good ramen is. True story, Oisa is where it's at!We found Oisa last year while we were doing Christmas festivities in Boston. It was cold outside and the scent of their burnt shallot oil beckoned to us from a ways off to give them a try. We all ordered the tonkatsu ramen and we were floored. It was AMAZING! We felt like it was the most authentic ramen we've had outside Japan and it was seriously well done.Despite the distance to travel to Boston from Newport, we have made the trek multiple times just to get out hands on this amazing bowl of happiness. Their perfectly soft boiled miso egg, toothsome noodles, and cloudy bone broth retains its authenticity and has been delicious every return trip. I'm sure their other items are good too, but their ramen is so phenomenal, I don't see myself ordering anything else in the future. I will gladly continue making the drive to eat here.Prices are excellent for the quality and quantity. Service is fast and friendly, and their options change slightly but their basics remain the same. The place is small so I have had to wait a few times to get inside, but they move you through pretty quickly. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars, they really are that good.> Ever since I had a ramen with a pork and dashi based broth in Japan (shout out to Menya Musashi in Shinjuku), I've had a soft spot for ramen restaurants that offer a dashi based broth option since the broth is one of the things I value most in any sort of noodle soup. When I discovered that Oisa offered a ""dashi niku"" ramen, I naturally decided I needed to check it out. Overall I enjoyed the dashi niku ramen. The broth had a nice dashi flavor as advertised (it's combined with a vegetable stock) and had a good amount of spiciness (it's a 50 cent charge to make it spicy). The sukiyaki beef was as flavorful as the beef you would find in a typical niku don which was good. The noodles were maybe a little less chewy that I'm used to but they were fine (there were a lot of noodles too). The tempura flakes were also a nice touch and added some nice texture contrast. As for places of improvement, I was a little underwhelmed by their soy (soft boiled) egg. I specifically asked to swap out the onsen egg with a soft boiled egg because I LOVE soft boiled eggs. The egg itself was cooKed well but lacked flavor - my impression is that they probably could have marinated it longer. I also felt like the ramen itself was missing one more ingredient to achieve a good variety of flavors. I would've loved to see some menma or even a piece of roasted seaweed included. I like Oisa ramen. The wait staff was super friendly, and their ramen flexed some creativity while providing nice traditional flavors. I would certainly consider coming here again over a place like Santouka or Yume Wo Kotare.","5, 3, 3, 5, 4"

I was the most underwhelmed with the flavor of the garlic because it was more of a light dusting of garlic oil rather than garlic in the bread to infuse it with flavor. I still don't think it wasn't bad and would still recommend getting it. ATMOSPHERE: It is on a very quiet street and can definitely be missed by many. But take note: don't let the space fool you (as I said at the beginning of the review). It is worth eating at, and definitely good Indian (as a non-Indian person, take my word with a grain of salt!!! But by my standards, it was amazing).SERVICE: Honestly a little slow, which was interesting considering we were the only ones there on a Friday night eating in LOL But it's ok, there was only one waiter and he was also taking in phone/pick up orders. OVERALL: A good experience that I will come back to again and am thankful I live so close to it! Also, it was a very cheap meal. For all of that food (which might not look like a lot, but we were very full after) it cost us about ~$25. I don't think it can get better than that in Boston.","4, 1, 3, 5, 5"

They do a great job on sides and main dishes alike. Good atmosphere for couples, small groups, and family event dining. Love their steaks, and their portions are spot on. In other Davio's locations, I have seen their desert carts, and all of their pastries and fruit and cream based dishes were fabulous, even worthy of the being sampled at the best of the North End bakeries.I have been to their Chestnut Hill location as well, and their main fare is fabulous at both locations. Parking is doable at the meters and at the surrounding garages. It's also easily accessible from Back Bay, the Theater District, and Chinatown.If you love Italian, and also want a change of pace, with their Northern Italian menu, check them out. It's really a 4.5 star place.> I've been to Davio's a few times now (primarily for restaurant week) and my experiences had been great. Their customer service is consistently great...and Davio's really trained their staff to treat their customers what they deserve...that they are valuable!Because the only few times I had been to Davio's were during restaurant week, I could only speak of some dishes that they offered and that...really...their dishes that were offered as part of the restaurant week meals could be hits or misses. My first time dining there, the mousse dessert was pretty comical...wasn't anything I would want to order or eat again. The second time I went, however, and picked the cheesecake was pretty legit!Overall, if you are looking for a nice ambiance, great service...a nice dimly lit dinner for your date or for a group of close colleagues or family members to celebrate special occasions, consider Davio's! Customer service is top notch. The restaurant week's menu may be ok, but I think their main menu offers much more and will really live up to your high standards/expectations of food!> What a lovely night with some fellow Yelp Elites and everyone's favorite plus one, Gary, whilst dining at Davio's for Dine Out Boston: Summer 2019! I organized the event with original designs on Marliave or Fogo De Chao as our dining destination, but when I realized that the event was growing and needed to accommodate a larger group of hungry Yelpers, I swapped the venue to Davio's, which has been a Dine Out Boston favorite of mine for quite some time. The Summer 2019 edition was no exception!Davio's is a ""Northern Italian Steakhouse"", so they cast a pretty wide net of menu items. On the main dinner menu, there's everything from seafood to housemade pastas, and of course, steaks. However, we were ballin' on a budget, and here for Dine Out, so let's just chat about that instead! There were two choices for appetizers, three for entrees, and two for desserts, all for the very fair price of $38. Compared to the prices on an average non-Dine Out visit, this is downright cheap. I was worried that the portion sizes would reflect the lower price, but everything was well sized and quite filling, especially the entree. I was impressed and pleasantly surprised!We all started out with the same appetizer, a duo of arancini rice balls stuffed with fresh crabmeat and fried to a golden brown. They were served alongside a ramekin of citrus aioli, which provided a nice contrast to the crispy goodness of the rice ball. There was also an ample amount of crabmeat, which was flavorful and filling. Along with some warm popovers, this provided an excellent start to our meal. The other option was a bruschetta with olive tapenade and heirloom tomatoes. I can't stand olives, so I made like Ariana Grande and said ""thank u, next"" to that one!The entree was a strong point of the meal for me, even though I broke the mold of everyone else's Swordfish Spiedini order and got the Scallop Spaghetti, which was served in an olive oil based sauce with chopped tomatoes and smoky gunciale, bacon's yummier Italian cousin. The pasta is homemade, and you can definitely tell in every perfect, al dente bite. The scallops were just okay, but I am not a huge scallop fan - I was more in it for the carbs. No worries, my boyfriend was thrilled to supplement his swordfish with my castoffs. No one in our party got the third option, a crispy chicken with lemon butter sauce, but if the pasta wasn't made in house, I had my eye on that one, too.Finally, the dessert course arrived, and this was also super great. The Amaretto Cheesecake was my selection, and it came beautifully plated with fresh whipped cream and raspberry sauce. The cake wasn't too heavy or cloying, and the amaretto lent a light almond flavor to the dessert that cut through the richness of the creamy cheese layer. I also ordered a side of homemade strawberry ice cream a la carte after I was convinced by our server to do so. It was one scoop, but it was LIFE CHANGING. Seriously, if you go here, you need to get the ice cream. Trust me.Dine Out Boston Summer 2019 was a success, overall. The courses were yummy, and the company was excellent. Special thanks to Joop, David, and Mark for making their way to Downtown Boston on a Friday evening to hang out and kick off Labor Day Weekend in style! We had a great time, not only for the food, but also for the fun conversation and wonderful camaraderie. Even though planning the event was totally crazy, it was absolutely worth it in the end! :)> I enjoyed a great date night at Davio's for Dine Out Boston. I made reservations for 8:30 Wednesday night and I took advantage of their partnership with lyft where you received about 25% off your ride to and from a participating Dine Out Boston restaurants. I was so excited to see they were taking part in this because I've been meaning to eat at Davio's for years. When my dad retired his company treated him out to lunch at the Davio's in Foxborough. He isn't the one for fancy restaurants and loves finding those delicious authentic hole in the wall type places, but he came home raving about Davio's. Ever since I have wanted to check it out and was very excited to finally do it.I ordered the crab arancini appetizer, the spaghetti scallop entree, and we got both desserts to split. The crab arancini was amazing and I loved the entire plate, I gobbled everything up. The spaghetti scallop dish very good. The pasta was cooked perfectly and I ate the all of it. You always appreciate when fresh pasta is cooked al dente. The only thing is, I wish the dish had been drained a bit as the guanciale made the dish very oily. I feel like it could have been prevented by draining some of it before serving. Thank goodness there is always room for dessert, because I was stuffed. The desserts were incredible and an amazing way to conclude the night. I want to mention the incredible service, our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I truly enjoyed date night and I can't wait to be back. I already know what I'm going to order when I return; the Maine Lobster risotto.> I've heard of Davio's before, but I never really knew what it was. My goodness was this place classy! Made it out here on the last day of restaurant week, and was able to try some great food at reasonable prices (pretty expensive otherwise). From the Prix-Fixe style restaurant week menu, I opted for the Arancini, Swordfish, and Chocolate Espresso Cake.Popovers served while we waited we're great. Such a wonderful idea to have popovers instead of just bread. Just s very nice and interesting touch. I think they were asiago popovers, but please do not quote me on this.The Arancini were amaze-balls (pun SO intended). They were cooked to absolute perfection, with just the right amount of crust on the outside, and softness on the inside. The size they came with was divine, good enough to finish even when the Arancini were already gone.The swordfish was good, however, the execution didn't really hit the spot for me. I felt that the fish was cooked and generally seasoned well, and the other garnishes and such were also well thought out. My critiques are this: First, I found it was a little too citrusy for my taste me. Second, there is something to be said for plating. The presentation was a bit messy, and I found that having everything sort of jumbled in made it more difficult to taste a distinct flavor from each component.Then there was dessert. This cake/ice cream hybrid was divine! I loved it that the consistency wasn't that of birthday cake or basic ice cream, but somewhere right in the middle. The sweetness was on point, and the layers were well thought out.Considering how fancy Davio's generally is, the portion for the price we're in line with what I expected. I didn't leave stuffed, but not at all hungry.The service was nice, and while it wasn't the fastest I've seen, it wasn't slow by any means.","4, 4, 4, 4, 4"

My husband and I used to live around the corner and this is the #1 spot we miss since leaving the neighborhood. The wings and tator tots are delicious. They are often playing 90s music loud enough to hear but soft enough to still have a conversation. The bartenders are all really friendly and chill. Definitely recommend this place!> The Corner Tavern is like stepping back in time to when a local corner pub would serve all your purposes and you would have a great experience a great time and make new friends. The corner Tavern is located on the corner of Marlborough Street and Mass Ave. Parking is almost impossible, but you may get lucky on Mass Ave and get a meter. If you're lucky enough the time limit is two hours. Luckily this is enough time to enjoy some of the hearty food and grab a drink. My buddy and I stopped in here and we utilized that two hours to the fullest. As we walked down into the basement you know you were in a Bostonian bar it looks as if the bar has been there for at least 50 or 100 years great wood detail old photos of Boston exposed brick everything you want for a Boston bar experience. The venue is not large but they do have about 15 seats at the bar and an array of tables. We opted for the bar seating. They have about six or seven beers on tap they come out ice cold. They have a great selection on the menu we decided to grab a few grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato bisque. This was a great decision you can mix-and-match about four or five cheese selections, multiple bread selections and the sandwiches are grilled to perfection. The bisque was the right texture and the right amount to go with a sandwich for dipping and tasted fantastic!! I'll definitely go back again just to grab a grilled cheese.  Hope you make it to the corner tavern and good luck with the parking.> I really wanted to like this place, but it is a 3-star review for now. The bartenders here are very nice and friendly. It is a neighborhood bar, as many people come here after the Red Sox game. It is clear that some patrons are regulars here.I actually tried a variety of things here:1. cider $7 (nothing special, just beer)2. nachos $10 (no... see below)3. margherita pizza (decent!)4. deviled eggs (not bad)5. Aviation cocktail $12 (i should have picked something else)My main problem is the nachos that I ordered. I guess I should have read the description more carefully. However, when I order nachos from a local/neighborhood bar, I expect sour cream and black beans, lots of them. The one that I got from here had these ingredients: queso, black bean & corn salsa (barely any), lettuce (too much lettuce), tomato (not enough), cilantro, chimichurri, and crema (not sour cream?). I am not sure what kind of sour cream they used, but it was not to my liking or what you expect from nachos...? I picked through my nachos plate and only ate half of it. And for the people who know me, they know this is almost like never happens. I rarely eat lettuce, and I finished all the lettuce in my bowl because it is more edible than the crema in my bowl. It offers food happy hour, so hooray!You should still come here as it is a cool place to hang out, but perhaps avoid ordering the nachos?> This is a great, semi-hidden spot for drinks (solid variety) with some low key damn good food. Meatballs, French onion soup, & all the burgers come with your choice of side and you'll be regretting if you pass on the pasta salad. It's pretty much a second entree portion of great pasta (dunno if fusilli is the standard but that's what ours was) in a tasty pesto. And a must get is the tots. You can't go wrong with this spot. Not meant for too large of a group as it's pretty narrow/cozy on the inside.> If I went to bars enough to warrant being a regular at one, I would want to be a regular at Corner Tavern (or as we call it, CT). I've come to CT several times for drinks with friends and it never disappoints. You can always count on friendly service, good food, and friendly vibes. It has exposed brick and low ceilings so it feels very intimate and a great place to share a drink with close friends or grab a meal alone at the bar.FOOD: I've only eaten there once and some friends and I shared the pretzels with queso. I'm not much of queso fan but this stuff tasted fresh, the kind of queso that is homemade and not from a can. And every other thing I've seen others get has looked good as well.Wil definitely be back to CT again and again.","5, 4, 3, 4, 4"

It's my kind of no frills Italian. I know everyone loves Monica's but Dino's serves my favorite Italian sandwich - solely because it comes with my ideal amount of hots as is and if you love spicy vinegar-y, go for extra hots!I'm drooling just thinking of this sub.> I loved this place so much that I went there twice in the 6 days I was in Boston. The first time I got the Lady Special sandwich and the Veggie sandwich (half and half-ed it with my mom). Both were really good, but I recommend the Lady Special. The balsamic glaze on the motz was perfect. The bread they use on both sandwiches is really good too!Second time I was there I got the Veggie Primavera with Garlic Cream sauce. It was AMAZING! They give you a piece of the good bread to go with it to. I would highly recommend it. My SO got the Chicken Parm Sandwich and really liked it too. He has really high standards for Chicken Parm, so I think it is safe to say that this place is legit.> I love their steak bomb sandwich it is absolutely delicious and my favorite here. I usually get it without hots. The owner is very nice and the food is always ready on time. I have tried other dishes and sandwiches including the gnocchi and the chicken Marsala but nothing is as good as the steak bomb here.> It was a chilly fall evening in Boston, I had just arrived but stumbled out into the cold in search of a hot sandwich and found Dino's right on the corner. It was on between Dino's and Monica's Mercato & Deli but the CHICKEN PESTO SANDWICH was calling my name. About 10-minutes later I walked out with a warm foot long sandwich cradled like a baby in my arms. CHICKEN PESTO SANDWICH (3/5): The fresh homemade pesto was delicious, the foot-long sandwich provided great value for the price, and the ingredients were fresh but the flavor of the chicken fell flat. No seasoning whatsoever. Perhaps some type of roasted vegetable or a bit of salt and pepper would bring out the flavor profiles of the sandwich because the pesto alone couldn't do it. It's a cute cozy space, not great for groups. Most tables seat 2-4 people.","5, 5, 5, 4, 3"

Its right in the commons and not too far of a walk if you are the downtown area to begin with. This particular location tends to get busy pretty quickly so I would recommend making a reservation prior to coming in. You can use the app ""Open Table"" and just book your reservation so you aren't waiting 10-20+ minutes for a table.> NEVER go to this place！I stopped by at 8:45pm but they told me they don't have any table for me to sit down and I can only take out(while I saw two tables there available). While I'm waiting for the orders, I sit on a side table. The waiter can not wait and just put the chairs on the top of the table while we are sitting there. For my to go orders, they said there are free corns and sausages in my order but I don't see a single piece. I ordered 1/2 lb of shrimp and there are only 4 pieces in...and they are not fresh at all. The king crabs taste like they have been frozen for 3 months. The sauce was not blend well. You can see a spoon of spicy sauce and garlics sit in the bag and were not blended at all.> Keeping it straight to the point. The place is small and cramp. Another patron walked by and knocked everything off my table by trying to get to her seat. Not her fault, the place was poorly arranged. Service, subpar nothing spectacular.  Waitress came up to me and asked ""you ready?"". The food runner dropped the food and left. No one asked if anything was ok. Or went beyond my attention for me to care. The hostess was blah and didn't even welcome us. The Pineapple Express was straight up grenadine and it was $22 for 2 people. No alcohol, too sweet. I've had bigger fishbowls before. The menu is easy to read and they kept it simple. The food was ok. Everything was served on paper plates and plastic bags, with fat gloves and plastic bibs.  People who definitely got sat WAY after us, received food way before us. I asked the waitress, wasn't too phased by my inquiry. Ended up, just asking for our check and  leaving. They was apologetic took our oysters off the bill. So the food that we did have, friend oysters - 6 for $12 came out hot and paired with 2 sauces. Overall would never be coming back.After going to Capri seafood in federal hill in providence, this place was nothing in comparison. From the atmosphere to the food. Subpar all around. not impressed. Good place if you want something relaxed and casual.> I would give negative score if I can!! This restaurant is not welcome anyone after 9pm although it says closed at 10! Arrived at 8:50, the waitress won't allow us to sit. When waiting for takeout, the waitress tried to stop us sitting at the ""closed area"" which was designated for waiting. Although we eventually have a seat, the waitress had to put all the chairs upside down on the table including those non-occupied ones on our table.. ridiculous!!When back to home with the order, you would note that you wouldn't get what you should. All the sausage and corns were not in the bag.. called the restaurant and they would say, oh sorry! You didn't check the bag? Anyway, they are free, so we didn't charge you... OMG, they are free so you should keep them? Am I supposed to check otherwise would be my own fault?> It was good testy food- thanks gays!Place is small... service is good!My daughter loves crayfish not me...Thank you for good time in restaurant I'm recommend for everyone!Thanks","4, 1, 1, 1, 4"

Sandwiches are the name of the game here and there are quite a few (read: all) that you should eventually try. My first trip here was with the steak tip sandwich and it was....great. Large is filling and probably too much for the lighter eaters out there. Do yourself a favor and make some time to come here. Be prepared to wait a tad during the midday rush. (But oh so worth it)> It's a small shop where you have to pass through the turnstile to go into the shop. That's something I've never seen before. The menu is near the turnstile and it's hard to see once you've gone through the turnstile. The atmosphere was a little uninviting because the workers seemed like they wanted you to get out of the store. We ordered the special of the week which is Italian sausage with peppers and onions. We waited for around 5 minutes for the sandwich to be toasted which felt unusually long but it went by fast since you can look around the store at all of the Italian goods. We paid for our sandwich just around the corner from where we ordered. Near the cashier, they have fresh pasta which looks really good. The sandwich was warm and it was cold outside so I was excited to eat it. When we opened it, we saw cheese all over the sausage slices...the menu didn't have cheese on it. If it's mozzarella, I'd be fine with it because it's the cheese I like, however, it was provolone. It's a pungent cheese and I'm not a fan of the smell but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the smell nor the taste. Putting that aside, the sandwich was okay, but I feel like Costco's Italian sausage sandwich is better and Costco gives more peppers and onions. Overall, I feel like the menu could have been more clear and the sandwich was too expensive for what it was.> This place was recommended to be via a group of sandwich aficionados (which I also consider myself to be) on the internet. After seeing a picture of their perfect Italian sando, I had to give it a try.The place is impeccably clean and charming and full of lots of little food items and things to look at while you're waiting on your food. The guy behind the counter was friendly, and I had my sandwich quickly.All the elements of the perfect sandwich were there: moist but not falling apart, perfectly baked bread, proper construction and order of ingredients, and the best combo of sweet, tangy and fresh flavors. They also pile on the thinly sliced meats, and honestly it was the best Italian sandwich I've ever had.> An amazing tasty Sandwich shop in Bostons Italian North End. I went to Monica's Mercato because of the rave reviews. And as well a the boast of have the ""Best Italian Sub"" in the North End.Well My Wife went in for I'm in a wheelchair and sadly Monica's Mercato is not wheelchair accessible. But that's Old School Boston for you not a problem as long as you have someone with you that walks.So my my wife goes in and orders 1 large Italian Sub & 1 1 large Chicken Pharm. Sub. roughly 20 mins. later she come out and we tucked in to the to Sub Sandwiches.They where oh so yummy. We both thought the Italian Sub was high quality, fresh & delicious. To me being Italian myself and have had scores of Italian Subs in my life. As for the ""Best Italian Sub"" in the North End.I would have to give is a maybe, until I try Bostons other Italian Subs in the North End. The Sub for me was very salty & a bit dry. I enjoyed the fresh Roll & homemade cured meats they put on the Sub. We enjoyed the Chicken Pharm. Sub. more. 2 Large Subs her were $13 each. Very large above average Subs I would absolutely come here again. Try it for yourself> I was told by a friend to visit Monica's if Neptune Oysters had a long line. If I'm being honest, I didn't expect much from an Italian sandwich place. Boy, was I wrong! Monica's was my first and last meal of my Boston trip. That says a lot because I usually don't go to the same restaurant twice while on a vacation. But I couldn't stop thinking about their Italian sub during my entire trip.

The lighting is weird and the dining room looks like it was set up that day with second hand tables and chairs.

I ordered a Belgian white ale and was given a can. No glass or anything, just a can. I ordered the lamb frites which was delicious. My husband, however, ordered the short rib Mac and cheese and we literally had to look for the short rib in it. It was all shells and cheese with two little pieces of short rib. For $25, it just didn't make sense. Way overpriced. The overall experience was OK, and living nearby I'll likely go back again. I suppose I'll be more selective of entree choices overall.> The smallest pasta dish ever with no sides I normally eat in Federal Hill for Italian foodSo I'm spoiled I probably received about a cupOf pasta for 18 dollars and a short pour on the wine for 11There's a lot of competition in Dot hope you read this Thanks> This homespun abode brings Back Bay prices to Dorchester. The service is fine. The kung pao calamari is more appetizing than the oven-roasted wings. And the pan-roasted salmon was divine!> This is the classic solid neighborhood two dollar sign sit-down.The lady serving us was nice, and they had a nice menu of items. The dumplings and pasta had a hint of polish flavors, and the burger was exactly medium rare. The thick bacon was also a nice touch.It's the type of $60 after tax and tip for two sit down place that you'd enjoy visiting on a weekday night.","5, 3, 4, 2, 4"

I was there on a business trip, just walked in with no reservation. I was greeted warmly and seated immediately. It was about 630 so a bit before things got very busy. My waiter had the specials down cold and was great about recommendations and wine without pretense.But the thing that made my experience very cool was not that or the food which was fantastic, what made me smile and want to come back was this.A mom and her daughter (7yo?) and her doll were sat at the next table. Special night? Who knows, but the staff took note and understood how important a 7yo's doll is. They took the time to ""wait"" on her and comment on her clothes and hair bow. They treated the doll like a patron and THAT was wonderful. The little girls smiles were ear to ear and so was moms. It doesn't take much to notice the little things but it made my dinner experience very cool.> Massimo and the team at Arya provide the best hospitable environment and most delicious food in the North End. I have been fortunate enough to attend some events at this cozy location on the second floor, overlooking the bustling street below. The crew has always been welcoming of our American Physical Therapy Association.I decided to bring my Mom here for a meal before the Boston Triatholon this past summer and the meatballs and pasta powered my through 1+26+6 miles the next day. Thank you to Massimo and Arya - I will be back!> Was here in August with a large group for my wife's birthday.  Instead of ordering individually, Massimo the owner offered to do the ordering for us and brought everything out family style - ribeye, scallops, sea bass, chicken parm, and more.  The food was unbelievable and the service was just as good.  Massimo and his team were super attentive throughout dinner.  If Massimo asks you to trust him with the ordering you should say yes please. Great spot.> It seems like so long ago, but I had an outstanding meal at Arya during Dine Out week only a few short weeks ago. The food was excellent, the ambiance of the restaurant had a rustic charm and the staff was very welcoming. It was nice chatting with the manager as well. The meatballs and bolognese were delicious and I'm left dreaming of the bread and oil as comfort carbs to ease the stress of life. Hoping to return when able and that everyone there is ok!> Best meal ever. Just being there the smell of others food will leave sour salivary ducts going wild and I wasn't even hungry. The service was great. We sat at the bar and the Brazilian talked a little about the history of the place. It's such a beautiful background filled with so much family related love.

The cabbage was very flavorful. The Mac and cheese is not the baked Mac and cheese i expect from a soulfood spot. It's more macaroni with a cheese sauce poured on it. Cheese sauce is a tad runny. Flavor is ok. The yams were really good. Very sweet, but that's how I like mine. Chicken was fried good. If you don't like dark meat, let them know when ordering it. Dark meat is the standard for the fried chicken meal. The kitchen was clean. The music was uplifting. I wish there was parking, but it's a major city.

So the moral of this story is to not leave and take a walk only to return in 40 minutes because you very well may get in a lot sooner.Great morning beverages and an outstanding menu.The place is VERY cozy (meaning tiny) but I really loved the ambiance and the staff is on their ""A"" game!One small warning of sorts. There is only ONE single occupant unisex restroom so if you have a phobia about such things (which I'm on record as not having such a concern myself) please be sure to ""go before you go""....or at least before you arrive!Lastly I really like, on the verge of love, the fact that they use cloth/linen (not actual linen) napkins meaning there is just a little less going into the garbage and landfills. They also use paper straws which is also an appreciated item compared to the plastic variety....even though for the vast majority of time I go straw-less on purpose or as some would say ""by design""......> Be ready to wait in line on weekends.We put our name down and the wait was around 30 minutes for 2 people. Getting a table is harder than getting a seat at the bar. I sat at the bar, but I recommend waiting for a table. The bar wasn't the most comfortable because people will be walking behind you a lot. We came on a rainy day, so the wet coats and bags made it less comfortable.I ordered a lobster benedict had very generous amounts of lobster. The benedict comes wit home fries which you can add onions, peppers, and cheese to. They came as a side with the Benedict. The home fries were very flavorful. Wish there was more! I nearly went to go try a piece and it was so hard to stop before I finished it off.The lobster benedict was yummy. The bread was saturated in sauce and the plate was very full of lobster.  Additionally, I got two orders of bacon, which came with a lot of bacon. Not the usual 2 strips that diners will give you.

The fig and prosciutto eggs Benedict was so delicious. I would like to also share that I have a nut and sesame seeds allergy and they were so efficient on letting me know they cleaned the grille before making my breakfast and I thought was so great!!!!

It was busy as soon as we got there but we were quickly sat 5 minutes at our table.I got the eggs Florentine with salmon. My fav brunch option. The fries what was on point with the added toppings.

I didn't particularly like the fries but the chocolate strawberry cake was a nice finish. (We shared it four ways.)> Since Legal Sea Foods is a boston legacy, we defintiely had to try this place before we ended our trip.  Lobster Bake: This is not what I imagined.  I imagined something like a savory lobster pot pie.  Instead, we received a platter of mussels, clams, and a lobster...all of which were steam baked.  While the seafood was fresh, think we were just expecting something a little different.  Clam chowder: The flavor was good, but half of the clams in the chowder had sand in it.  I absolutely hate sandy clam chowder ...Fish and Chips: The fish was fried nicely, but the portion sizes were small.  They do give you a lot of onion rings and fries...but I'd rather have more fish.  Whie the experience here wasn't bad, it was defintiely a chain-restaurant type of experience.  3 stars.> I'm from out of town. I had to try this place because of its clam chowder and lobster. I walked in, place wasn't too busy at 5 pm. The server was nice and gave me multiple recommendations. I ordered three raw oysters, a lobster bake, and the wine flight (I love that they have tasting flights for wine!).Then the food came. Wow. I was really, really disappointed. I don't know if it's because it's different from West Coast/Asian seafood (I've never been to the East Coast till now) but wow. My first bite of their famous clam chowder showered my mouth in sand. I decided to give it another try, and found that the next clam was clean. The soup was otherwise delicious! So I kept eating and kept encountering grains of sand (though not quite as bad as my first bite). It was delicious but I couldn't finish because my teeth were hurting. Then the oysters came. I am an oyster fanatic. A seafood fanatic, in fact. And never, NEVER, have I ever had an oyster so full of shell parts that I've had to spit it out. The first two oysters were decent and had maybe 1-2 bits of shell. That's alright. But the last one I just spat out. I couldn't keep chewing it after I spat out 4 large bits of shell. The oyster itself? Delicious. The shell? No. Then for the lobster bake. The lobster itself was good. Not the best I've had but pretty darn good. The steamed clams? Shells and sand, shells and sand again. My jaw and teeth are buzzing from the countless bits of sand and shell. I actually stopped eating and just left half the clams on my plate because my teeth couldn't anymore.I told the server when he stopped by once during the meal that the soup & oysters were filled with sand, in hopes that he'll tell whoever is in the kitchen to prevent it from happening to all the other diners. No one else came by during my meal. Not even to refill my water. It wasn't busy during the hour I was here (5-6), lots of empty tables. I'm so sad because I was so excited about trying this place. Of course I'm inevitably going to encounter some sand bits here and there. That's fine and normal! But to the extent that I had? It ruined my dining experience. I don't know if they have a new person who washes the clams/shells oysters but please let them know that their technique is not working. I spent almost $100 on food for myself but I am actually never going to recommend this place or come back if I am ever back in Boston. Maybe everything else that doesn't have a shell is good. Unfortunately, I'll never know.Update: I ordered a cup of their famous clam chowder to-go for my younger sister to try. She also said there was an uncommon amount of sand in her chowder, enough to ruin her experience of it and throw the rest away. She lives here in the East Coast so..changes need to be made for the preparation of the shellfish at this establishment!> We're big fans of Legal Seafoods so, for us, having dinner here was the perfect way to end our Boston vacation.   When we go out to eat, we try to avoid peak dinner times so we were here at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday.The person at the host station promptly seated us at a two top that was at a long banquette.  That was fine since the place wasn't busy.Our server was excellent.  He was prompt, friendly and efficient.  For starters, my husband had a cup of fish chowder.  He has always liked their fish chowder.  However, Legal seems to take this item on and off their menu.  Once when we didn't see it on the menu, our server (at the now closed Legal at the Tysons Galleria) told us that just because it wasn't on the menu, didn't mean you couldn't get it.  I wish restaurants didn't do things like that.  Either keep it on the menu or just don't have any ""secret"" menu items.  Anyway, my husband was pleased with his chowder.Also, we got, for a starter, ""Blackened raw tuna 'sashimi' "" which consists of: ""sesame chili vinaigrette, seaweed salad and wasabi"".  It was tasty, if a bit on the overly spicy side and the portion size was just right for the two of us.For our entree, we both got ""Anna's baked Boston cod"".  This has been on legal's menu for a long time.  Anna was a Legal Seafoods cook who created this dish, hence the reason for its name.  We were surprised that it was ""baked cod"".  For years, it was ""baked scrod"".  Of course, there is no fish called scrod.   Scrod stands for ""select catch received on the day"".    Calling a fish ""scrod"" gives a restaurant the leeway to use whatever white fish they happen to have at the time.  Thus, our surprise at seeing ""cod"" in the item description.  For a time, cod was being over fished.  Perhaps, it is now more plentiful.Anyway... This dish consists of: ""seasoned crumbs, roasted tomato, jasmine rice, butternut squash"".  The fish was nicely baked and flaky.  The sides were perfectly prepared.  This is a nice, filling dish---and a popular one at Legal.All in all, a great meal.  Usually I give Legal Seafoods 5 stars.  However, we weren't all that happy with some of their menu changes.  For example, Legal used to allow diners to choose the sides they want for most entrees.  We miss that.  I also miss their cream of crab soup.  Still, these things won't stop us from going to Legal.> We were in the theatre district a couple hours before our show and wanted some seafood. There were obviously several options here in Boston, but we settled on Legal Sea Foods since we'd walked by it three times. The location is huge- so there was tons of seating. But they filled up pretty quickly on a Friday night! Lots of large parties and small groups as well- seating was varied. Prices were fair and portions were huge. We both ordered a cup of clam chowder (delicious with tons of meat in it) and then split the large seafood platter (fried). It has everything- shrimp, whitefish, scallops, clams, calamari, etc all on a bed of French fries. The breading was light and there was so much seafood! We didn't even finish the fries (& we were SO hungry when we went in). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is for the cocktails. They were just so-so, kind of watery and not well presented. It looked like it was just in a water glass. Overall, I definitely recommend stopping in and trying something! (We saw several people with full lobsters that looked amazing)","5, 3, 2, 4, 4"

I just want to give the entire bar and everyone in it a big hug for treating us so well.

They're probably my go-to for taco food delivery in my area (Watertown) as my preferred taco places in the area don't deliver (Taqueria El Amigo and Taqueria Mexico--both in Waltham).

To the point where I'll usually order two bags and eat one myself and the other (for the wife) we'll usually split =P. The tacos have been good so far. The agave pulled pork was very yummy, the fish tacos were just meh and the carnitas were solid. There are unfortunately better options for the last two, including Los Amigos having better fish tacos. The tacquitos were very meh as well, which is a shame. Definitely go to Taqueria El Amigo for these.Drinks: They offer several varieties of Jarritos, which is always a taco food staple. My personal favorite is the Pina, but to each their own.Service is usually pretty good. Sure it looks like you're ordering from a convenience store, but when you get it for delivery, it comes in fast, usually less than 30 min for food prep and delivery!

Found this spot in East Boston just a few miles away and so glad we came here! It was a small quaint restaurant with music playing, soccer games playing on 2 screens, and several tables were taken up by locals. We ordered 3 papusas, one of each flavor, chicken & beef quesadillas, and caldo De res (beef soup). Everything was delicious! The cheese on the papusas was AMAZING. The meat in the quesadillas was yummy. The beef in the soup was tender, flavorful and melt in your mouth. The soup had corn and yucca as well, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

We had the Camarones a la diabla (Shrimp in Hot Sauce) along with Shrimp and Pollo Tacos. Generous portions and the flavors were authentic. Just awesome!> I've probably eaten here more than 100 times now. The tacos are good about 85% of the time, but they are really inconsistent with the amount of meat they give or the quality of the pork. A few nights ago it was amazing. The tacos were loaded with meat and the pork has some burnt edges. Yummy! Overall though the tacos are very expensive for the amount of food you get ($2.50 each) - they are tiny. A man needs to order at least 6 and probably 4 for a woman. I only get tacos here.","5, 1, 4, 5, 4"

Inside was chaos, albeit an efficient kind of chaos that everyone but me seemed to understand. There was no line to speak of; sandwich orders were shouted from all directions like battle cries. What to get? I would love to say that I lost my Chicken Lou's virginity to the ""sex on the beach"" sandwich, but the overwhelming bustle only allowed me a cursory glance at the extensive menu. Alas, I settled on the spicy Lou's, a huge roll stuffed with buffalo fried chicken and pepper jack cheese. Scarfing it down in the span of 15 minutes, I felt greasy and nauseated - but most of all, I felt supremely satisfied. I licked my lips, wiped my hands and proceeded to tote the remaining 1/4 sandwich to class along with a few stained napkins for later use, proudly announcing to the world like bloodied sheets of the milestone I had reached. As the overpowering chicken smell wafted to every corner of the poorly-ventilated classroom, my peers shot me many jealous glances, to which I responded with a sly, buffalo sauce-tinged half-smile that said ""bring it on, bitch.""

I've now been here several times despite visiting from out of town. The food is excellent and the service is great. Extra bonus is that it is three minutes from my friend's place. In the past, my friend and I have split the salmon pistacchio and arancini. Both hearty, flavorful, and delicious. Most recently, I stopped in for dinner a week ago after a long day at work. I went with the bolognese; I think my friend ordered the carbonara. We shared the burrata. Everything was wonderful. At its price point, I think the portions are good and fulfilling. My bolognese was flavorful and as advertised with a nice amount of meat and sauce; my friend's carbonara had delicious pancetta and the sauce was just creamy and heavy enough without being sickening. He really liked the balsamic glaze and burrata; neither of us cared for the prosciutto. As we sat down at the bar, the bartender, who has served us before, asked my friend if he wanted an old fashion to warm up. I opted ordering that while my friend opted for beer and a glass of wine. I felt bad as I did not like the old fashion and my friend ended up finishing up all the drinks. On the second visit during this recent trip, I found the E-Mule-ioooo. I was debating between that and Before It Was Cool. Luckily, my friend was eyeing the latter so I could try both. Now, I don't know my alcohol and was surprised it came in the copper mug. My friend was like, ""I don't like Moscow Mules."" In the end, he thought it was pretty good and finished my drink along with his, which I also liked. After downing half the E-Mule-ioooo pretty quickly, I felt sleepy so his drink with the espresso and beans helped a little bit. I was just surprised my friend could finish both our drinks after having four beers at The Quiet Few while we watched the Pats on Saturday. The ambiance at Pazza is pretty chill and for the most part, volume is reasonable. They had different games on the tvs behind the bar so when my friend requested they change the channel, they complied so I thought that was nice customer service.> Came in for late night just after they opened. Disappointed at first they started serving the late menu at 1030 instead of the stated 11pm. But we made do. Sat at the bar. Slow service but decent. Went back for brunch recently, what a different experience. The specials were great (donuts and a breakfast sandwich!). The waitress we had was amazing. She told us about their specials during the week too.Living so close, I'll be back for sure.> 3.5 stars. The short of it: skip the entrees, sit in the beautiful bar, and feast on great appetizers and cocktails.We've been twice since this establishment replaced Craft Table. The first time was opening night. I'll spare you the details regarding service given that they were brand new in our first visit. We visited again service was fabulous.So far we've had the cabonara, the fisherman's dish with seafood and risotto, a pink sauce pasta dish, calamari, burrata app, ricotta app, and many(!) cocktails.The calamari was bland and obviously frozen. The cabonara the first time was stellar: creamy, yolky sauce with chewy pasta. The second time the cabonara tasted completely different, like Alfredo!! The risotto was watery and underseasoned, and the pink pasta dish was boring. Standouts are the burrata followed by the ricotta.Happy they're here, and we'll be sticking to.the delicious cocktails and apps.> Still missing Ecco, variety, decent drinks, they just dont seem to be catering to the neighborhood. Instead, trying to be relevant and trendy.Server "" Will"" , was nice, helpful and holding down several sections. Competent and capable, they're lucky to have some good help. Drinks ""before it was cool"" (espresso martini) yummy, but too small a portion, served with a foamy head, maybe 5 oz. Pour.""Nobody like a shady beach"" (rum punch variation)  horrible name and description really, she thought itd be sweet, tropical and fun, instead thought it tasted like dirty sand, the drink was almost brown, and garnished with pineapple leaves, instead of the pineapple. Small pour here too, but considering it wasnt great, that was fine.Appetizers: stuffed pepper, tasty, good portion, mozz, ground beef rice, seasoning, over tomato sauce,  sauce was bland and useless in the dish, offering nothing but color. And calamari,  very small portion, accompanied with same tomato sauce,  absolutely absent of discernable flavor, no profound flavor profile expected in italian cuisine and the portion was that of a upscale restuarant and completely underwhelming,  this calamari seemed iqf (frozen) rather than hand breaded as the portion and price might suggest. And had almost as many peppers as calamari parts. Meh..Entree: Ribeye, cooked med, at 9 pm on a Sunday, game night.. ehh, really just basic. Covered in a version of Salisbury steak gravy.. brown gravy smothering a 26$ ribeye... ok steak was not a prime cut, maybe choice or perhaps select. They could do better here.Impressions: 1) too open to knock down the sounds travelling throughout space. One loud group will easily take over the room.2) games on, inviting in the game crowd but offering no game type menu items, no wings,  even lollipops or higher end versions. Also no pizzas even a decent house style flatbread, or personal gourmet pizzas, why? I'm baffled.. as explained, santarpios wont allow a pizza sold that close.. I'd say call it a cheesy baked cracker.. not a pizza, problem solved. (They do offer the same Bianco and sons sausage tho..)3) cant be because they are going higher end and they dont care to do pizza or wings, after all they use french fries as a side for several menu items. This place needs bar pickins or they will suffer same fate as Craft. (Prior Tenant) This place follows the last, down the path of let's be trendy, not timeless, classic.. Best way to describe Pazza on Porter; ""Potential,  but has an identity crisis. Dont try to innovate every detail, embrace some classics, and be bold on flavor.""> This is one of my new favorite spots! Upon walking in a absolutely LOVED the vibe, it's trendy without being pretentious and instantly feels warm and inviting. That inviting feeling became more evident while looking at the diverse crowd at the bar; this did not present as just another gentrified Eastie spot.  There were plenty of tvs to watch the game but they didn't overpower the atmosphere.  They have a unique and quirky drink menu I had their version of a Negroni as well as a house infused whiskey drink, my partner had a dirty martini topped with a blue cheese stuffed olive and followed it up with a Negroni as well, they were all delicious! We had the muscles for an app and they were cooked perfectly in a fra diavlo which was perfectly spicy. For dinner we both had the caprese salad with steak tips and it was sooooo good! The staff was wonderful, and a special thanks to Thor who was both bar tending and serving us at the high top. He was friendly and skilled at his mixology! The staff gifted us espresso martinis after an earlier discussion about them.  We will be here many times to come!","5, 5, 4, 3, 5"

Not only Stella is one of the only open restaurants in the area at this time, the owner really tried to accommodate. I got a Turkey Parm sandwich on a croissant, which was absolutely mouthwatering. Thank you Evan, I wish you and your restaurant all the best!> A place I had yet to go to during my 3 years in the South End, and finally went and enjoyed. Ordered the flavorful braised short rib grilled pizza ($23, flatbread covered with soft meat, arugula, fig preserves, gorgonzola, and sprinkled with balsamic), Stella homemade gnocchi ($23, tomato, basil, reggiano), with corona beers ($7, came in a nice tall glass, supporting the company in the midst of the coronavirus craze), and ended with delicious tiramisu ($9, block of cake easily shared btwn 2 people, rich coffee taste comes thru in the moist, decadent treat). We used the ""free dessert with two courses"" coupon on yelp. Pros: - good quality food that didn't disappoint, including the yummy starter bread - a wide variety of alcohol options- nice environment - excellent customer service, kind waitressesCons:- expensive $$$, definitely can't come here very often - can be pretty dark inside at nighttime, not enough lighting> No idea how it took me so long to get to Stella, but boy am I happy I did. The atmosphere was great: dark and a little upbeat. They make their own pastas, so what could go wrong. The arancinis were a fastball right down the middle, but the standout was the short rib w/ pappardelle> Had the best dinner at Stella on a Tues night around 730pm with a party of 4. We had a reservation for around a week but there were still different time slots the night of. There's ample outdoor and indoor seating...way bigger than I was expecting. The menu is the perfect size - not too big that's it's overwhelming but more than enough options to choose from and something for everyone. They have a vegetarian and gluten free menu as well. The kitchen told my veggie/vegan friend they could really do whatever she needed which was so great and considerate!We split arancini (2 decent sized ones in an order) as well as an arugula salad to start. Everyone ordered pastas for their entrees. I went with the shrimp scampi and my friends ordered the bolognese, spaghetti and meatballs, and orecchiette with broccoli and chili flakes/tomato. They all looked amazing! The shrimp scampi was perfect. Very generous portion, lots of shrimp, and the perfect breadcrumb topper. We also split a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc. Would definitely come back and highly recommend. Can't wait to try more of the pastas.> A wonderful spot for brunch or dinner. There aren't many places where you can have arancini and tiramisu for breakfast!As a student in the area, I have been a number of times and Stella never disappoints. It's quiet and beautifully, naturally lit during the day and a romantic spot at night. It does get a little loud, but there's a good amount of space between tables so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the party next to you.The pasta is fresh and delicious, and they have a great selection of cocktails too.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

My girlfriend and I discovered La Catrina when we moved into our first apt. together, just up the street, and it has since become a weekly (and sometimes more) outing for us. She has many dietary restrictions, and the waitresses + kitchen crew have always accommodated, as well as offered suggestions for other menu items for my girlfriend to discover and love. As for me, I'd be an idiot to not get at least one Asada taco from the taco list when I'm there, as they are far and away the best I've ever had. Ultimately, La Catrina is a hole-in-the-wall diamond that offers high quality service, food, and atmosphere. Being a BYOB spot, definitely stop around the corner first and grab some wine or beer to pair!Thank you being great! P.S. La Catrina has the coolest bathroom in Brighton/Brookline.> There was one tiny stripe, not a pepper.  It looked like someone's leftovers for real.  OK, during this crisis, I grabbed frozen ""Chilles Rellenos"" during a quick last minute trip to stock up on food.  This is not from this restaurant, but I'm just trying to show you an example of a poblano pepper (size/amount), cut open, then closed and covered with the sauce that came with.I never tried these before, but please see the pictures as this is the amount of pepper I would have expected.  Will keep you posted.Note taken: Customer ordered a tamale.  Customer expected a poblano pepper not a stripe.  Please see example picture of a poblano tamale.Also, not the unprofessionalism of owner.  In order to try to make your business look like you want to make the customer happy with your restaurant, you should invite them to come in and give it a second chance.  Instead, you are basically disagreeing with the customer who is giving objective review.  Attached next you will see an example of a poblano tamale.I also saw 2-3 other reviews about the tamale (could use more pepper, couldn't find the filling, etc., so it's not just me).  I am guessing you have not heard of constructive criticism - which means in this type of situation to take an objective view of something and possibly reconsider what others may think or desire in a poblano tamale. (I.e. to improve this dish.)Increased to 3*** due to owner's prompt response.> I ordered la catrina via grub hub and I'm sorry to say it was a disappointment. I'm not sure if they were having an off night but the food was beyond disappointing. The biggest complaint I had were the nachos. For $13 ( I added on guacamole and jalapeños) it was highway robbery. The portion was small first of all. But that's not even my biggest complaint... the cheese on the nachos wasn't cooked properly and there was very little meat on it. There were also tons of ""naked chips""For the amount of money it cost, it was highway robbery. My five year old could have put together a better looking plate of nachos. The fiesta quesadilla was mediocre, again for the price it should have been better...and the bread for the torta looked like supermarket bread. I know this is a small business but people should be forewarned that execution was poor. I'm really frustrated because we spent $50 for takeout ( which should get you a lot for Mexican food) and I really feel like we were taken for a ride. We won't be back> Small restaurant, good Mexican food. Went on a rainy Saturday night in October and were able to sit right away. Very casual atmosphere, BYOB. Service was good but a little slow. Only one server but she was working hard to keep everything moving along. Had the chips and guacamole to start. Very fresh but a little heavy on the lime for me. Had the Fiesta Quesadilla with chicken. Good mix of chicken and cheese. My dining companions had the enchiladas and they said they were good. So if you want some good Mexican food in a casual atmosphere give La Catrina a try.> I've been here multiple times after my first visit and I can't get over this place! The food is delicious and there's a wide variety of Mexican staples on the menus. Plus, I love the atmosphere with the beautiful and quirky decor. Love this place and can not recommend enough :)","5, 3, 1, 1, 1"

We don't have to subject ourselves to shit service and condescending men. I arrived at this establishment at 11:40pm. My partner ordered a capirina and I ordered a margarita. We then ordered wings and fish and chips. 15 mins go by and we have received our food. No drinks and we also had no water. We start eating the waitress says the manager will make our drinks because it's taking so long and they have 1 bartender on a Saturday night.Okay cool, but why don't you have 1 bartender on a Saturday night? We have now finished our food and are chatting with friends and still have not received our drinks. At this point, for what? We want the check. It's 12:30 no drinks and the waitress is completely avoiding us.

He tells me that he will take them off the check as if that was some sort of grand gesture. I told him that was already happening because I was returning them anyway. So I asked him what more can he do and he rudely interrupted me and told me he can take them off the check. After about 5 mins of him talking over me and telling me how he's been in this business for 34 years (fucking great) my partner interjected and just asked for the check because obviously he did not care about our experience.He suggested since we have had such a bad experience that we do not come back and I told him I wasn't planning on it he didn't need to suggest it. This is the worst service I have ever received from the most condescending owner I have ever met. Obviously 34 years hasn't taught you shit.Sorry for the curses readers...I never got my margarita.> This is my family friend's experience, you have to do better with treating your customers....So earlier this afternoon me and a friend went to Top Mix Bar & Kitchen and we both order the American French toast breakfast. The breakfast was cold and the French toast taste basically  like they pop it in the toaster and sprinkled cinnamon and powder sugar over it. Very dry and tough to eat. It had to be drenched in syrupy just to try and eat it. The scramble eggs taste like French onion soup. We kindly ask to speak with the manger regarding the food and the manger stated to the waitress that he was to busy to come out and talk to us and was only willing to take off $4 dollars off the bill and keep in my mind my friend couldn't eat her food at all. Bad business Never again.> Bottles of cool refreshing water now top each of the tables in the back room of Top Mix Bar & Kitchen, which was a nice convenience.As always, service was pleasant.  Food took some time to prepare.  And the golden plantain chips with dipping sauce were satisfying.The fried fish pieces filling the fish tacos $13.99 were a better portion than the last time I had enjoyed the dish myself.  However, on this visit I was sharing the Roasted Garlic Lime Pico De Gallo Steak Tacos $13.99 and the Avocado and Bacon Chopped Salad $9.99 (avocado no longer grilled) topped with shrimp $7.99 (for 8).Their grilled shrimp were perfectly cooked as always!  The salad refreshing and crisp.  However, while the steak in the tacos were perfectly cooked, it was somehow lacking in flavor.  While the sauce did something to make up for the flavor lack, the tacos were also lacking in a crisp element.  It was an unexpected disappointment.  Another DC agreed and could only manage to eat one of the two steak tacos on his plate.3 star visit at a 4 star location.***Consensus from previous visits reiterated:Come when you have time for a leisurely meal.Come for fried food.Come for their plantain chips and accompanying dipping sauce.> Amazing food but subpar service. Waitress forgot to bring out one of our appetizers twice. Didn't receive it until after she brought us the bill and it wasn't even really that warm (the shrimp guacamole bites) Otherwise food was amazing. Golden plantain and cheese plate ratio was way off. Only 3 pieces of cheese for a whole plate of plantains. Steak tips were amazing *chef's hand kiss*.

The best part was the avocado spread which I think had a little spice to it (or maybe it was the cheese). Unfortunately I found the beef to be overly chewy and the chicken to be very dry. Otherwise, this is a filling sandwich and can be split into two meals. I'd consider returning if I was in the area.> You order at the small counter and then go online to where the food is to get your order. The staff at the counter was very sweet and explained what was in each other to us and answered our questions. We ordered a BBQ chicken empanada and a combo sandwich. The bbw chicken is really spicy but I also cannot handle spice. The combo sandwich was mediocre and bland. It tastes fresh from the avocado and the tomatoes. It was also the first time I got green beans on a sandwich. The green beans were similar to that of public school green beans.Three stars for the food and four for the service.> Chacarero has literally become a landmark for me and my colleagues. When it was announced that we were moving offices, this was the first thing that was pointed out: ""Oh man, we're going to be down that little alley to Chaca. THERE IS A DIRECT PATH TO CHACA."" There is a small sit down area if you want to eat in (we usually grab the sandwiches to go. My favorite thing on the menu is the barbeque combo. You get chicken and beef on bread, topped with cheese, sauce, green beans, avocado spread, tomato, roasted bell peppers, and salt and pepper. If you love spicy food, you can ask for extra hot (original spice level is relatively mild). The extra hotness level depends on the day (hahaha #same), but it ranges from ""That has a great kick to it!"" to ""I am sweating so much, this is better than a detox or a sitting in a sauna."" If there is a line (and there's probably a line), don't let it scare you away. Chaca has the most efficient sandwich making system I've ever seen. Seriously. See you there!","5, 4, 3, 4, 5"

Staff is very courteous with great service.> I am so happy to have found this place. My parents and I stopped in on our way home from an out of town excursion. We heard about Nachlo and were intrigued. From the moment we walked in until the moment we finished our food, we were pleased. The aroma in the restaurant was perfect and I knew the food was going to be good. There is a special smell when Desi food is made right.  We spoke with the owner who was happily making dishes along side a couple of other men who were working. One of those other men recognized us from another restaurant that we occasionally pick up kebabs from. That place also makes delicious food. We knew that if he worked there previously, this food was going to be delicious. We ordered a variety of dishes from chicken biriyani to seekh kebab, chapli kebab, chicken tikka, lamb barbacoa quesadilla, naan, and paratha. All of it was excellent. Spicy and delicious! The heat level was quite high. We were wondering how our firangi friends could handle this level of spice. It was so good. The prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly. The food is a treat for your tastebuds.Everything was good, but the lamb barbacoa quesadilla was my favorite. The way that the meat is spiced is so good. I want more of this. I will happily go back to Nachlo. My parents will as well. We don't normally eat Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi food from a restaurant because we cook it at home. Nachlo is a nice option to have. Please support this business. I want to see them do well.> I have to say that this place is deceiving. Who would've thought Mexican and Pakistani would be a place to go to. We were starving and needed to eat, so we gave this place a try. Glad we did. Huge portions, great service, good food, we will definitely come again.> So.. visiting Boston from New York, looking for a halal place to eat at and came across this place.And wow! I ordered the chicken quesadilla (Kaisay diya) :P and it came out great. Owners and worker was super nice and friendly. Felt like home. Food is delish. Will deff come back :)> I live right around the corner and Nachlo makes the outrageous Boston rent that I'm paying worth it.I ordered three kebabs, which are $1.99 each expecting them to be like your typical string of meat on a skewer. Instead, I got three delicious rolls of chicken (think jumbo hot dog size) and they even threw in a side of rice for free!While I was waiting for the food, the owners of the store were so fun to talk to and happy to let me try samples of some really spicy sauces and sides. As someone who has had a hard time finding restaurants in Boston that know what I mean when I say that I want my food spicy, I can really appreciate an establishment that can make me cry tears of spicy, spicy joy.","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

Ordering is easy, with the premade bowls or even the build your own because all the ingredients are organized for you to see. It's a great place to grab a quick bite if you're craving noodles or something warm. Their drinks are refreshing as well, my favorite is the yuzu citrus jasmine tea!It's definitely my favorite store from the Love Art brand.> Love Art Udon is a shop specializing in creative broth + broth-less udon dishes. I enjoyed my visit here and will definitely be back! I came in on a rainy Tuesday evening and it was very toasty and warm inside. I loved the atmosphere of the place! Their nicely-lit interior had fun, sprawling art plastered along the walls and a large neon pink sign by the seating area for optimal aesthetics. Their menu consisted of ten premade choices with a build-your-own option as well and a couple of drinks. I ordered their broth-less Okonomi Udon ($10.50), which consisted of chewy udon noodles and two pieces of shrimp tempura tossed in a two-sauce blend and topped with scallions, bonito & tempura flakes, and nori furikake. (** Note: if you check in on Yelp, you can get a free drink! Be sure to do it because I definitely forgot until after...!) This dish was pretty enjoyable! The udon noodles were plentiful and had the perfect texture. They didn't skimp on their savory sauce blend- there was more than enough. I thought the shrimp tempura pieces were quite bland and lacked crispiness. They tasted great when paired with the sauce, however :- ) All of the toppings were fresh and offered lots of flavor and texture with each bite (or slurp). Because of this dish's broth-less nature, I found the sauces to be a bit overwhelming and salty after awhile! I'm definitely going to try one of their broth dishes when I revisit. :- )> My opinion could totally be biased since I haven't had Udon since moving here half a year ago. I've been CRAVING it hard. But this 100% satisfied my craving. My boyfriend who claims he ""doesn't even like udon"" liked the fusion take on Udon here. I had the Mala bowl and added a potato croquette. The croquette was perfect! Nicely fluffy inside with a crispy outside. The bowl was also really tasty and filling. My boyfriend had the Okonomi bowl, which we both agreed was better than mine. It was super creamy, and the flavors worked together really nicely. The bowls in general aren't traditional, but the flavors really work! The drinks are also really refreshing. We had the lilikoi and the yuzu ones, and liked them both. Not too sweet either! The interior is really nice and modern: cute neon signs and artwork. And all the workers are really nice too! I would definitely come back.> Food: Love art Udon deserves a 3.5 star instead, as your typical quick-bites noodle. They have many flavors and you can create your own combinations with or without the broths. We got the spicy miso, curry, and original udon with matcha lemonade and lilikoi fresca drinks. The matcha lemonade is not the best combo, but the fresca is a decently refreshing passion fruit drink. The udons are average, considering how some taste very bland while others are too strong. The fried sweet potatoes on the curry udon are crispy and crunchy but stale. Pricing is fair and it is worth the occasional revisit. Service: Customer selections on toppings/add-ons are placed on display. The ordering process is quick and simple and the employees are very kind. Atmosphere: The seatings are a mix of linear countertops and table/booth gatherings. I love the interior murals and pop lightings. The location is conveniently near other restaurants/cafes and also accessible by the T.> Love it! I enjoyed the beef udon with the original broth, so flavorful!! This is the first time I had a meal from Love Art Udon and it will not be the last! We had it delivered and it was hot, nicely packaged and quick. The hint of cilantro was just right. I would have never thought to add that ... yum!Give it a try next time you are in Boston! :)","4, 4, 5, 3, 5"

But their Kale Caesar Salad is just too good. And I feel so healthy eating it! Their shiitake bacon is amazing and provides such a depth of flavor. The croutons are so crunchy and taste even better drowned in sauce. So ask for extra salad dressing! I also got their sweet potato fries  which were so crispy and I didn't feel oily after eating them.

The menu items & inside decor just give you IG moments but above all it gives you great wholesome food. I ordered their new chicky salad, red velvet cupcake, & mango tea. It was a bit steep for lunch but there are definitely value meals that could be chosen. The salad was large & in charge. Plenty of greens & salad trimmings that paired well together. The red velvet cupcake was decent even though it was gluten free. The chicky which seems to be plant based chicken was just ok for me. Luckily the salad flavors really enhanced the chicky, I'm not sure I would try them on their own. I didn't try the burgers this time around but they were sure did look delicious. I cant wait to explore more of this menu!> Pros:-Cute ambiance-Lots of seating-Super tender meat substitutesCons:-Pricey-No nutrition info available! :( Hoping they'll change this in the future.--Guac BurgerThe sweet potato/quinoa/black bean patty was soft and tasty, though doesn't taste like meat. I've gotten this a few times and would get it again. Pesto MeatballSuper tender and decently flavorful meat substitute. I'd get this again. Classic BurgerWithout sauces, the predominant taste was salt. The patty (tempeh/lentil/chia/walnut) texture was fine, but I do not recommend unless you have a high tolerance for salt. Chocolate Ganache Donut ($3.50) - 2.5/5, but not really a donutThis was essentially a slice of chocolate cake shaped like a donut, topped with chocolate ganache and sprinkles. It didn't even taste like a cake donut. The ganache was the best part as it wasn't overly sweet. The sprinkles didn't add anything other than color and an unnecessary crunchy texture. The cake itself wasn't that dry but after one bite of this I desperately needed water or milk. It was a bit reminiscent of a Little Debbie or Hostess snack. Wouldn't get it again.","4, 3, 4, 5, 4"

Stopped by on a Saturday night around midnight, and I was happy the line went quickly. The gryro spot makes everything to order, and despite the rush staff are friendly and helpful. I ordered the falafel. The falafel tasted as though it was made from scratch but it was a bit too dry/chalky on the inside. Their toppings and tahini were delicious but not enough to overcome.

Ginger Exchange replaced the old Mission Sushi at this location. After a complete renovation of the space and the menu, this restaurant has brought a modern and classy vibe to the area. The decor is well done, with loungey bench seating along the walls and tables lining the perimeter of the space. The atmosphere is relaxing and a nice break from the busy Longwood medical area. One downside is that the bench seating is higher than the chairs so half of your party will be at an awkwardly high level compared to the other half. Not a problem if you are vertically challenged but your dining partner is tall! The menu has been redesigned to be more bowl-focused but also has the same sushi specials and offerings from Mission Sushi. I've come here 2 times and ordered takeout multiple times. Some of the best items I've gotten were the Crab Rangoons and the Vietnamese coffee. Although there were only 6 small rangoons, they were delicious! The Vietnamese iced coffee was not too sweet and had a very strong and rich coffee flavor that is unlike the standard Starbucks flavor. It's almost like Nescafé but more of a kick. Items that I've tried that were pretty good were the spicy California roll, shrimp tempura roll, sweet potato roll, sweet garlic udon noodles. These were all fine, nothing to write home about. One item that I did not enjoy was the Korean loaded fries. There was too much cheese (never thought I'd say that!) and it was very heavy. The fries themselves were just okay. The flavors were interesting with kimchi and cheese but it was just too much as an appetizer split between 2 people. The place is usually not crowded and you can get a table if you just walk in with no to minimal wait. Service is prompt. If you are ever in the Brigham circle area and craving Asian food, I would recommend Ginger Exchange!> Tried their Exchange noodle soup for lunch - it was pretty solid, albiet a bit pricey for a lunch at $13 so I couldn't have this daily (ample food though). You choose the broth, noodles, and protein, and it was packaged up thoughtfully to keep the components separate so nothing got soggy until I was ready to eat, and was ready to go as soon as I got there by a very friendly host. Taste was pretty good overall- I thought the coconut curry broth was solid, and the veggies were plentiful (although the broccoli was looking a bit yellow) while the tofu was unfried and sort of fell apart after a while (I think fried may be a better structural choice for soup?). Wish they had lunch specials though- during the day, I'd prefer a smaller portion for a smaller price, which other area restaurants do offer.> Ordered the pad thai and the pizza sushi . pizza sushi was good ! pad thai was a let down though :( the peanut sauce was not peanut buttery at all unfortunately. good place for sushi , not the best pad thai> This is the fourth Ginger Exchange location in and around the Boston area. Upon first impression, the new location is clean and well decorated. Staff are friendly and attentive. The menu is expansive and includes sushi, rice bowls, noodles, and much more! They also serve alcohol and cocktail prices were under $10! I had the Great Gatsby sushi roll and my boyfriend ordered the Korean beef rice bowl. We both agreed the food was mediocre but worth coming back for. While there are other choices for Asian in Mission Hill, this is a great addition because of the price point, large menu, and fun drinks. Needless to say, I'm very excited that Ginger Exchange is now in my hood!> Friendly staff, quick and efficient service.

How can one explain the way Blunch bagel sandwiches float into one's mid-morning dreams on Saturday after a night out? They gently nudge you awake and remind you the end to your current misery is around the corner; the cure is out there. Your Saturday morning revival ends with 'Make It Spicy' and starts with 'Everything BLTC Add Egg'. Sure, you may get a tug to ""stay in bed, you can just go to Dunks,"" but then you remember the King himself swears by this place. That's right. I'm taking about Guy Feiri. He put his Flavor Town Kiss seal of approval on this place, and suddenly you find yourself swinging open the door of the welcoming, neighborhood spot - Blunch. The folks that run the place treat every customer the same regardless of any visible evidence of the mistakes one made the night before; they greet you warmly and serve you eagerly. Next Saturday, I'll see you at Blunch. Food: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Service: 5/5> Not uber impressed with my sandwich like some others. Mostly all bread and dressing. I paid for a lot of bread for a lot of money. The pictures made it look like I was about to get some stuffings. Not for me!!!! Boooo! Didn't enjoy. And drinks are foo foo and not that great.> Solid place for a toasted sandwich! There's several options for egg and bagel sandwiches, but I can only comment on lunch so far. I got the Lower End East side with roast beef, horseradish cream coleslaw, and fried shallots on rye (aI asked for it without the dill pickle chips that usually come with it). I didn't taste the shallots but the sandwich was very good. The rye was well toasted and will definitely make your gums a bit blistered, but very worth it.Blunch has about 7-8 seats inside and has a couple of benches outside. Parking may be a bit tough but I see a lot of people grabbing the sandwiches to go.> What a magical place! This is my favorite spot in the South End! If you haven't tried this place, there must be gaping hole in your soul waiting to be filled..All of their eggwhiches are amazing, though my favorites are their lunch sandwiches.  My go to is ""The Bird"" - it's light, simple and beyond delicious! And please for the love of god, try the chocolate chip cookie!!> My friend and I decided to trek here since I read through the restaurant's accolades on Yelp. Lots of people raved over the bird panini, which has chicken, roasted tomatoes, greens, fontina cheese, and artichoke aioli. I ordered that with spicy aioli added onto it. My friend and I waited about 5-10 minutes for our sandwiches. The tables serendipitously cleared out by the time we got them, a blessing in this tight seating area. My friend ordered the Big Papi panini since I'd told him it's apparently another beloved sandwich here. I really liked the crunch of the bread and softness on the inside and the pattern pressed onto it. The chicken was good, and the spicy aioli wasn't spicy but it contributed a nice, slightly vinegar-y taste to the panini. I also liked the oven roasted tomatoes but I felt like there were too few. The cheese and greens barely registered in my taste buds. On the other hand, the big papi was excellent. Overall, it was good.","5, 2, 4, 5, 4"

I particularly like the location in Harvard because they have more space for people to stand indoors and more places to browse while you're waiting in line to be seated. The ramen is delicious. My favorite is the toroniku ramen (shoyu - soy) flavored. I'd recommend getting a small size if you plan on getting an appetizer. Their portions are pretty big. Yhe gyoza is crispy and flavorful. The staff are friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and has a very upbeat vibe.> I have a long history with Santouka, and it breaks my heart to have to write this, but it's been 3 separate experiences now, and I have to say something. Santouka was my first bowl of ramen well over a decade ago, and it's been a long ramen journey ever since - my favorite food by far.For some reason, the Harvard Sq location's quality has taken a nosedive off the deep end within the past few months, and I don't think I can eat here anymore. When they FINALLY showed up in Boston several years ago, I was psyched, despite their prices being more than both the Jersey and Cali prices (shipping maybe?). I was glad to pay it just so I could have that lovely broth and delicious noodles again - and let's not forget the tonkotsu pork! Melts in your mouth I tell you - or it used to.For the second time now I go in, no line like there usually is - and order my usual. Shio broth was awful last time so I try Soy. I'm extra hungry so I order Gyoza also. The Gyoza came almost immediately... okay sure maybe they fried them in bulk. Underwhelming. The Ramen arrives finally, I try the broth and it is completely bland, again. I try the tonkotsu pork, and it seems it's from the night before. Completely dry, very little flavor, and the fat seems non existent. I was shocked. On top of that, the noodles that are usually delicious (despite being frozen) are unpleasantly chewy and not tasty, like they were in the freezer too long.What in the world happened?? Now I have a friend visiting from North Carolina and I had pointed him toward this place in the past - he just messaged me saying he had an awful experience as well! I don't know if the cook quit or something, but I wish this went back to the way it was. 1 star because it literally was one of my favorite places in Boston. Heartbroken.> I would say this is one of better ramen place, not the best but better than some other places. Ramen broth is hot and pretty good.When it comes to service, it's such a sh*t show. I have been there three times. All three times I had to wait one hour at least. That's even after put our names ahead of time. You have to do following three things if you want to have table in reasonable time. - Put your name on the list using app - Call ahead to confirm  - Check in yet again with front staffIf you don't follow these steps, even if your name is top of the list you have to wait another 40 minutes. One of front staff gave me so much sh*t. Overall, decent food but terrible service. If I have not been to ramen places in Japan or Korea, I could probably give three stars. But I am having hard time giving anything above two.> Old customer here updating review. As other recent reviewers noted, this place went downhill to the point that they are now just scamming their customers. Ordered delivery - a standard ramen with chashu pork and a bunch of other ingredients on Uber Eats. Paid a steep $30. Service was fast and great, but to my surprise the order included ONLY broth and terrible stuck-together noodles!! No pork, no anything. I called the restaurant, nobody picked up, left a message, nobody called back. Had to dispute with Uber Eats, thankfully  they reimbursed. Look, i understand restaurant industry is stressed due to COVID-19, but this is a bit much. Send an empty cup of broth for $30? No call, no follow up? I now think, when I order food delivery: ""Which businesses do I want to see on the ""other side?"" Well, not Santouka. I hope you go bankrupt fast. P.S. I want to add that this was not the case of ""we ran out of ingredients, sorry."" They knew what they were doing - they didn't have anything yet they still charged $30 (!) for just .... broth. They did send a ""receipt"" printed (see attached), showing they are out of ALL the ingredients. Didn't call to cancel the order, just took the money.","5, 4, 1, 2, 1"

I've tried almost every item on the menu and liked everything.> *This Review is based on an Ubereats Order*Confession, I had never had Asian fried chicken before. I know people talk about Chinese chicken wings being amazing but I just could never bring myself to order fried chicken from an Asian spot. Well, I've clearly been missing out! Moon Flower House served up some of the best darn fried chicken I've ever head! I mean it was proper crispy with just a little bit of spicy kick! The fried chicken and rice combo is a must...the flavorful chicken with the fluffy subtle tasting white rice is EVERYTHING!> I'll probably revisit for burgers and sandwiches that people rave about, but never for desserts. To be fair, both the tea and ice cream seem to be made in house--the taro tea was richly aromatic and strawberry ice cream had a chunk of strawberry in it. As for the chocolate ice cream, a scoop was way too tiny for me to really enjoy and figure out the quality. One ""scoop"" of ice cream ($2.75 each) is a teeny bit more than a teaspoonful which is ridiculous! And yes, what you see there are two scoops of ice cream. Another complaint is that the tea came with the white bubbles(?) that had a strange texture and honestly ruined the awesome tea flavor. As for the ice cream, I don't plan to order it ever again, but it'd be nice to have more options with toppings for bobas.> I absolutely loveee their fried chicken burger. The combo is great with fries and chicken wings. Prices are reasonable for serving size. Fries are reallyyyy good too. Great for carb cravings. One of the best burgers I've tried!!Parking is feasible on-street.> Really delicious place. Crispy chicken and juicy. We get the spicy chicken and love it. The combos are great. You get fries, sandwiches and wings!So good. And we had them delivered and everything was super fresh. My brother said this was on of the best chicken sandwiches he had.","5, 5, 1, 5, 4"

Also dirt cheap to the extent where I couldn't really give anything less than a five star rating even if it was a 4-star sandwich, which it's not. When a sandwich is this tasty at this price, is five stars even fair?It's not the best I've had, those would be in places like Houston and San Francisco and Dallas, but for this price it's definitely extraordinarily good value and extremely tasty and authentic.I have all my old sighs, they're all right here and accounted for, but where the hell has the New Sigh Gone?

There was plenty to look at (widespread selection of foods and drinks) and the atmosphere was very warm. Ultimately settled at La Pescheria during happy hour (4-6pm weekdays). The line moved fairly fast (~15 minutes) and the servers were very courteous and friendly. I recommend getting there around 5:30pm latest in order to have enough time to order seconds if you want. My friend and I ordered a dozen of the $1 oysters which were SO fresh. Definitely will be visiting again soon!Heads-up: Oysters must be ordered in multiples of 6!11/10 would recommend!> while in town for the boston marathon, i met up with a friend and fellow marathoner for lunch here.  this place is a like a hybrid grocery store and restaurant/cafe, and i almost felt like i was walking through a market in italy since there were so many options!  since it was close to easter, they also had quite a few easter-themed food, desserts, chocolates, and decorations...love the easter deco!!after perusing a few menus, i decided to ""build my own"" salad, choosing  a fresh green salad base with multiple veggies + chicken thigh for protein.  total was $14.34 with tax, not bad considering the portion size. we sat in the cafe seating area, which was quite crowded since it was a shared space, and eataly was quite busy at this time of day.  but it wasn't so noisy that we couldn't enjoy our lunches and have a nice conversation, catching up about running, the marathon, and all things related to boston.i'll definitely want to return here since there were so many options that i wanted to try, alas, only 1 stomach!  conveniently located in the back bay neighborhood, near prudential, copley & back bay t stations.> I visited the location to find a wine new to Eataly USA. One of my friends is the producer and made a post saying that his wine was now available across all US stores, including Boston. The wine manager I spoke with when I arrived tonight said he had never heard of it, and was quite rude. He just didn't seem to care that I had come all the way into Boston to find this particular Italian wine, which is incredible. It's even featured on Eataly's website for Valentine's Day!I was also a bit disappointed he didn't take down my name and gave me a call when/ if the wine should arrive.Totally unpleasant experience here!> High class Italian eating and shopping, and this was quite the treat. Little did I know they have a location in other big cities, but this is not Olive Garden I am talking about here, so I can write about this one and not feel guilty about it. The food here is not cheap, but getting the $18 two course meal really paid off. It comes with an unlimited amount of bread, which tastes fresh and delicious. The pasta is also superb (I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with the beef carpaccio). Yes the plates are a bit on the small side (but not too small), but the experience and smells that you go through when you come in just take you to another level. It took me a lot of restraint not to buy the whole store because I would have if I had the strength, money, and power to do so!It is located right inside the Prudential Center, a high class mall reminiscent of Tyson's II in DC. But this one is better laid out and has less foreigners rummaging through to find the perfect deals. I totally recommend coming to this shop/restaurant and getting yourself a hearty dinner. This is what Back Bay is all about, this, right outside downtown! Get on the Orange Line and get your butt out here, now!> This is a review of La Pizza & La Pasta at the Eataly Boston location. My fiancé is a Boston native and we try and go back at least once a year. We typically stay at the Sheraton inside of the Prudential center or the Hilton across the street. Eataly is a quick walk and well worth it, even in the cold!I heard about Eataly and was dying to go so I was thrilled to see one so close to our hotel. As soon as we entered I was in literal foodie heaven! It's restaurants meets sweet little food haul and ALL things amazing. From the delicious meats, the scent of fresh breads and the insane wine selection I knew I was going to fall in love with this place. We chose La Pizza and waited a quick 15 minutes before being seated. We opted for the fresh mozzarella appetizer and it was phenomenal. Slightly warm on the inside, doused with olive oil and a light sprinkle of salt. We followed with a fresh margarita pizza which was cracker thin and delicious. We also enjoyed a bottle of wine with our meal which was the perfect addition.Overall the restaurant is beautiful and the menu is simple yet delicious. We will definitely make a stop there on our next trip to Boston.","5, 4, 2, 4, 5"

The real product is no wear even 10% near it. The soup contains couple strings of beef, some bean sprouts, and some egg drop. It looks worse than a meal you made with kitchen sink ingredients.. guess how much it was? $24 with delivery charges. The item itself is $17. Whoever owns this business should really look at yourself in the mirror hard, how can you lie to your customer like this? Shame on you.> What is tonkatsu? Is this place the king? Some people thought it was a ramen spot, but it definitely does not sell tonkotsu ramen. I really wanted  to like this place, but instead of being Japanese style it's probably Korean. There's  jjajungmyun and tofu soup on the menu. The funniest thing I saw on the menu was the curry has a smiley face on it with cucumbers .I got their Tonkatsu King combo #1 with the 2 sides as kimchi and steamed egg. Pretty random sides, and the egg was too cold and salty. There is also a side of miso soup which seems to have beef broth in it. I was very confused. The tonkatsu itself isn't too bad and it's crunchy.  The picture  on the menu looked a soggy and drenched in sauce, but it's the opposite. Maybe the cheese katsu is better.> Amazing food, great and efficient service. They have Korean and Japanese options such as curries and noodles. The fire chicken was amazing and I love the accompaniments that came along the platter.

Also probably the best pizza not named  Regina's in Boston.> It had been about 20 years since I had been in Boston- so I decided to walk around my old neighborhood. I asked a mailman where he recommended grabbing a quick lunch and he suggested this place. I could tell it was a neighborhood favorite, with many regular customers. It had a nice casual vibe. Everyone at the bar ordered pizzas, so I followed suit, and went with this mushroom lovers pizza that was really really good. Bartenders were friendly, as were the fellow patrons. Hope to return again!> Brendan and Becca:Had a good friend come into town and we were looking for a casual place for burgers, pizza, and beer in Fenway. Came across Woody's in our search and it was a great find.We had seen a picture of the buffalo wings online and they looked delicious so we gave them a try. The picture did not lie. The wings were phenomenal! Not sure how they were cooked, but they weren't overly crispy and dry like some bar buffalo wings can be. Instead, they were perfectly crisp while still being deliciously juicy like a rotisserie chicken. We also had the brussels sprouts which came in a balsamic vinegar-based sauce. We all love brussels sprouts and balsamic vinegar, but agreed that the dish could have been an executed better. Still enjoyable, but were definitely the low point of our meal. For dinner we all split the Kitchen Sink and Chicken Caesar Salad pizzas. Both pizzas were extremely well-executed. The crust managed to stay crispy even despite all of the juicy toppings and sauces loaded onto them. The beer selection was large with a variety of local brewery and commercial domestic beer options. Serving sizes were large and the prices were more than reasonable. Despite being three big eaters, we could not finish all of the food and had to get some packed up to go. In our classic style, we left the to go bag on the table.We enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant has a dive bar feel and is pretty dimly lit to match that vibe. It was decently busy while we were there with local customers sitting at the bar and waves of the baseball crowd after a game. Despite the hustle and bustle of the night, our waitress was super attentive and the service was quick. Overall, we will definitely recommend Woody's as a good casual go to if you're in the neighborhood.> Based on Yelp reviews, we chose this place near Northeastern's campus for dinner after move in. I ordered an appetizer of polenta with wild mushrooms, blistered grape tomatoes and asparagus. I had them put grilled salmon on it, and the combo was fabulous.  My only wish was that the polenta had been loose versus fried patties.  Son had a burger, and raved about the meat quality.  Drinks were reasonable and service was friendly and fast.  For a bar and grill, an excellent meal!> I'm basing my review of Woody's based on 3 factors:1. Dine in Experience2. Delivery Experience3. Customer serviceI dined in at Woodys and was delighted by the atmosphere- great waiter, attentive, personable and efficient! The manager (or maybe owner?) was sitting at the bar, but often would get up to check in on customers or to help his employees. I also enjoyed the art on the walls made my local artists. I was incredibly tempted to buy this one owl piece.

Tasted perfect though.> *1 Star for Takeout**4 Stars for Dine-In*I've been to Harvard Gardens several times for dine-in meals and drinks - it's generally been a positive experience (good portions and quality food, but sometimes slow service).Unfortunately their take-out was a complete disappointment. I ordered the fish and chips entree as well as fish tacos. The fish tacos were cold with little fish inside (I picked up the order in person, so the cold was not due to a slow driver). The fish and chips dish was a complete joke - I have literally never seen a worse version of the dish. The fried fish was prepared in a round ball-like shape, hardly bigger than a clementine (three ""balls"" included with the meal). If I'm paying $18+ for fish and chips, I expect to see something that actually resembles a fish filet -- not a ball of fish with a poor man's batter on the outside. I can't understand how they had no shame to serve such a thing. I would've much rather had the McDonalds Filet-O-Fish than this deep fried ball of random fish meat.> GREAT pub!!! The bartenders are so nice & helpful. Good pub food. A MUST TRY is the homemade blackberry dark & stormy!! C'mon....the blackberry syrup is HOUSE MADE!  Very cool pub to visit while in Boston. Liz is awesome!!> Amazing place if you are in the Boston area and are looking for a great brunch place. My friends and I went to Boston for a weekend gateway and we stopped here for brunch. Harvard Gardens was absolutely amazing! They have a great deal when it comes to mimosas because you can order a pitcher to spilt with your group. Everyone ordered something different, but everyone loved what they ordered. The food was great and the service was great as well. Also this place has a lot of gluten friendly options! I recommend this place if you are in the Boston area! Oh and I'm sure this place is good to go to besides brunch!> My sister and I were in the area doing some wedding dress fittings/shopping and we were looking to have a healthy brunch before hand. And by healthy I mean bloody Mary's and breakfast sandwiches. I looked on Yelp and found Harvard Gardens. The photos online looked really fun and the food looked delicious, my sister and I both loved the menu options as well. I was able to make a reservation, easily about five minutes before hand via Opentable. We arrived and the place was just about empty, we were allowed to select whatever seating we wanted. There were booths available, hightops, and bar seating. We ordered our bloody Mary's with Tito's, we ordered a breakfast sandwich and an omelette, I added avocado and fruit. I did have a dress fitting, after all. My sister and I were a little bit pressed for time towards the end and we had a little bit of a hard time finding our server to get our bill, but other than that, this place was good and the food was delicious with hefty portions. I would definitely return, maybe for an evening experience. The place itself, was more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant environment like what was shown in the photos, but it was still nice and they had some cute Christmas decorations up to add to the charm. It's in a good location, and I would recommend taking an Uber or a Lyft because parking is sparse.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

Friendly staff that also made sure to be precise on a mobile order. Lots of people can have the same name...so order # being correct is a must.> This place was just really kind of strange to be honest. I wasn't sure what the heck I was supposed to be building in a bowl, considering I had rice or lettuce, then all of a sudden an option for Mac and cheese in the mix. Then a choice of meat and tiny servings of sauce. I was like an odd ""choose your destiny"" kind of situation.Overall, service did go fast during peak lunch time. They had some chicken options and it wasn't overcooked and had some seasoning. Paired it with some rice, extra carbs on top of those and sweet potatoes. The Siracha sauce was a bit too odd for my but that garlic sauce was super good. (I think it was garlic) so give that one a go.This place was a bit too ""lets be kichy with farm fresh vegan yaya yada"" for my taste. But if you want a healthy option in the area and are into that calling your salad ""greens"" and are sick of Sweetgreen, then check it out. You won't be dissapointed at the end of the day and theres enough options that the bowl building is somewhat endless.> This place is wonderful. Everything in my bowl was wonderfully created and seasoned. I got the brown rice, kale Caesar, roasted carrots, and chicken thigh. Great portions for around $10 for an excellent balanced meal. The place is set up a little weird and indoor seating is small, but it's delicious.> Another restaurant within a four block radius that serves ""bowls"" of food.  Within these four blocks are two Sweet Greens, chipotle, and a Mediterranean, an Indian, and a Japanese place that all serve some form of a bowl with a base carb like rice with your choice of protein, greens, and dressing.  Their bowl is smaller than sweet greens, all the choices are healthy and they have some good protein choices.  I got the charred chicken thighs on faro with kale and broccoli.  All of the bowls in the area are priced around $11-13 with the exception chipotle which is the low price leader, but is also the lowest quality food of the bowl restaurants in the area.  I'll add diginn to the list of bowl restaurants that I visit every week.Update - went back for my second visit.  Suggestion to DigInn - I don't understand some of the sides and proteins.  I don't envision how I would put spicy meatballs on rice or faro, and then I don't envision myself ever adding mac and cheese as a side on top of a base carb.  Suggest that you create some pre-configured dishes built on the bases - similar to the way SweetGreens has some pre-configured bowls.","5, 5, 3, 5, 4"

Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Surprisingly it's usually packed out of the house in the evening but around noon you can slip in no problem.There's plenty of seating inside whether you're trying to sit at the bar and grab a drink or come in a group for a table. Lots of lighting and tv screens showing sports games throughout the day. It's a great setup honestly Kendall needed a place like this.I ordered the cornbread to start. It was phenomenal. Kind of squishy but soft, sweet and fresh. I low-key didn't want to share it but I split it with my group. Some of the best house cornbread I've had.As an entree I ordered the Chicken and waffles. To be honest despite the popularity of the combo I'm not the biggest fan of combining fried chicken (which I like) and house made waffles (which I like) into one dish. But I did it, and it was really good. The portions were huge so I didn't get to finish it. See the picture below.Those that I came with ordered the catfish sandwich, burger, and ranch fries. They all enjoyed the food they ordered and said great things.I noticed they have oysters and a large drink menu so as an oyster fiend I'm definitely going to have to come back for those.Overall great restaurant. Glad it's in Kendall and I'm excited for the next time I come to eat here.> Came in with my girl for $1 oysters 4-6 but they don't have that anymore. Awkwarrrrrrrrrd$2 an oyster f that we got the black pepper chicken wit ranch friesPlace is cool with parking in the front> This spot recently opened near my office, so my friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday. Overall, service could be a bit better, but the food was great!I had the timmy's tendies in original, with ranch. They were big breast pieces with a super crunchy exterior. I could see the salt on the breading but I felt they were missing a bit in the flavor department. Once dipped in the ranch, I didn't miss the seasoning though. The ranch fries on the side were delicious as were the homemade pickles. The slaw was also somewhat bland but it was light and actually a nice respite from the friedness of the chicken and fries.My friend had the Mr Henson sandwich that she really liked. By the end she had taken off the bread though -- the chicken is good enough by itself! When asked if she wanted fries with it she said yes (it wasn't clear that she was ordering a separate side of fries). Grapefruit soda was super tasty as well, and loved that they served with pellet ice.Would definitely come back with a fried chicken hankering.> Some of the better fried chicken in the area. Not Coast Cafe good but definitely worth a visit. And you can eat the chicken sitting down while it's hot, imagine.If only because for $20 the 4 piece tray comes with an entire half chicken. Large, succulent thigh, drumsticks, breast pieces arrive on a tray breaded well and fried perfectly. The skin is crisp and holds to the meat without separating with each bite. Available in regular, hot and honey black pepper, the tray is able to be had half and half, this time hot and honey black pepper. The heat level of the ""hot""  is definitely muted aNd barely noticeable. The honey black pepper is a stickier, fiery, better option.Pressure frying seems to be a method that brings great results in this case. All of the meat - including the thick breast - is juicy and moist. Practically gushing juices in some places. That's a win right there - moist fried chicken breast. Most likely helped by the buttermilk bribe but it is excellent chicken.The coleslaw is red cabbage and shredded carrot in vinaigrette with black pepper. Crisp, tart, cuts the chicken fat admirably.A fried chicken sandwich with pimentos only complaint is that the pimento is excessive.The service was a excellent.The space is beautiful - light, airy, expansive. Think huge plate glass windows, soaring steel beams and reclaimed wood. Somehow it feels comfortable despite being in the middle of an area of town that is mostly pavement, cement and tall office buildings.Great beers on tap - although not enough local microbrews. Full bar.Definitely on the return visit list.> Lily P's is a fairly new restaurant in the Kendall area that seems to be known for their fried chicken and oyster specials. I came for lunch so I opted on a fried chicken sandwich with  a side of mac & cheese rather than order one of the larger chicken platters. The fried chicken was good but next time I would skip the pimento cheese that comes with the sandwich. The mac and cheese decent but it could have used more seasoning. Overall good lunch option for the area with plenty of seating space for those packed weekday lunches.","4, 4, 4, 4, 3"

Went yesterday for the second time after my grilled cheese with turkey and avocado. This time had the porchetta, dear god, every mouthful was heaven. Next time will try the burger. You won't be disappointed!> I hate to do this as I was so excited a vegan option was added but... it's not good.My wrap was so, so oily, it was soaked through and I could only eat a few bites.  It was messy and there was puddle of oil at the bottom of the wrapper.  The flavor was just ok.I will add that the packaging/branding is very nice and staff is friendly, but overall this was a very disappointing experience.I am sad I wasted food and nearly $13 :(> Yummy new spot in the south end. The stand out item was definitely the Porchetta sandwich, with juicy meat and great flavors. The hot sauce was super fresh and such a good addition. The brisket was also good, but the meat was too fatty (even for brisket). The slaw on the brisket sandwich was a nice touch. There had been previous complaints of an automatic 20% tip being added, but that is no longer the case. The prices are a little high though, 2 sandwiches and a donut ended up costing $35. A good ""treat yo-self"" lunch spot!> Really solid spot - we tried four of their sandwiches recently.  Clear favorite was the ""Gobbler"" (turkey, gravy, cran deliciousness) with the falafel a close second (only complaint is that the falafel is so huge some of your bites are just pure falafel - they'd benefit from cutting it in half to distribute).  Brisket had potential (the pimento goat cheese was really nice), but the brisket itself was a bit dry.  We all felt the porchetta was the weakest - I found the garlic rabe super bitter and overpowering.  Will return to try the others, though it will be hard to stray from the Gobbler and Falafel duo - really great stuff.> Sally's Sandwiches is soooo yummy, what a wonderful addition to the Gallows Group empire! Despite the 99-degree heat, we made the walk out to this little doughnut/sandwich shop and we didn't regret it. The porchetta ($13) was juicy and rich, but contrasted nicely with the greens and the aioli. The bun was soft and fluffy. Great sandwich. The falafel was also excellent -- packed with flavor. Both sandwiches were reasonable in size -- not massive but a responsible amount of food. Or maybe I just thought it was responsible because it was so delicious I invariably wanted more. I would be remiss to not mention that the vegan peach jam doughnut was lovely as well -- soft and bursting with tangy peach jam.Wish I lived closer so I could get breakfast, lunch, and dessert at Sally's/Blackbird every day!","5, 1, 4, 4, 5"

When we got there, we loved the atmosphere and the drinks and the waitresses were great. We got the Ceviche, grilled octopus, Indian lamb and risotto. To be honest all were solid not fantastic. We finished with the banana bread dessert which was great, but the real issues didn't begin until we got home.As soon as we got home something was up with my stomach, but it wasn't until I was woken up at 3 am nauseous that I knew something was wrong. I had to rush to the bathroom the vomit and basically stayed in there until 6 am. My girlfriend herself had similar symptoms and actually had to call out of work the next day. We split everything, so it's hard to nail down exactly what the cause was but my guess would be the ceviche or the octopus which was a bit slimy on the inside. If the food was over the top great, I'd probably give them a second chance but after seeing the reviews of others getting sick from their seafood I would recommend avoiding this place totally. If you can't prepare seafood correctly don't serve it.> I absolutely love this restaurant.  My only complain about this place is the service.. specially at the bar. Anyway here my absolute favorite dishes: - Cuban Cigar: Absolutely delicious!  - Grilled Skirt Steak - Magical! You will 100% order a second. - Jalapeños Rellenos: Only get this if you for real, can handle spicy. This is very very spicy; drinking snack. - Polvo a Lagareiro - Yes, they also make really good Octopus! & my favorite cocktail is of course Once Upon A Time in Mexico.> Friday night 6:30 P.M. there were no empty tables so make your reservation! It was dimly lit so could be a nice spot for a romantic evening, if you're into screaming at each other because it's so loud.The concept of this restaurant is unique. Everything ordered come in small share plates (like tapas, but in the menu it literally says don't call them tapas lol) and it has foods that are widely known in different countries. Spain, Russia, Italy, Portugal, and France are just some of the options on the menu. So if you ask your girlfriend what she wants to eat and she says I don't know, take her here.The food was good. I just wished they seasoned more. Other than that had a good time.> Cuchi Cuchi has some very unique decor (""I expect nothing less from Cambridge,"" my friend said) which may or may not be your thing. But what will probably be to your liking is the food. My friend and I got 4 tapas (or ""international small plates"" as they call them ) and we were impressed with most of them. In fact, I was so satisfied with the scallops provencal that I would definitely consider coming back in the future .The 4 tapas we got were:- Scallops Provençal: scallops were cooked perfectly and whatever mushroom thing they had underneath it (reminds me most of stuffing) was delicious too. Word of advice, try to limit the lemon juice to the scallops as it can overpower the flavors of the mushroom stuffing imo. Random but I also found that the presentation of this dish with the seaweed is not exactly the most appetizing; I would stick with just the shell if I were the chef.- Tsukune: these chicken meatballs definitely had somenice Japanese flavors to them (there's a soy-mirin coating similar to a Japanese Hamburg). The avocado crema wasn't really noticeable on first bite but I guess it fit. The watermelon rind was pretty disgusting tbh. Next time I'll just pretend it's just for presentation purposes like the seaweed from the last dish.- Brie en croute: apples and walnuts were nice. Puff pastry and brie were delicious. Biggest surprise was whatever bacon jam was with the cheese in the puff pastry. It was flavorful and complemented everything nicely. - Chicken Kiev: don't have much of a reference point for this since I've never had chicken Kiev before but this was probably the most disappointing dish. The mushroom and spinach were fine (probably cuz of the herb butter) but the chicken lacked flavor.All in all, a pretty good dining experience and I was happy with the variety of tapas options. I actually think 3 dishes would have been fine for my friend and I (she doesn't eat much and I had a big lunch) so I wouldn't necessarily commit to the two tapas dishes they recommend per person.","5, 5, 1, 4, 4"

It's a small shop frequented by locals and other visitors. Everything is made fresh and packed on the spot after you order.   The top three items I like getting there are: 1) the cold cut banh mi sandwich 2) Thit nuong- the rice noodles with various sausages and cold cut meats 3) pandan jelly (sold in the mini styrofoam tray) in front of the food counterAside from the prepared foods, there are so many other desserts and snacks you can find around the shop. Depending on what time you go, sometimes there is a long wait. The line wraps around the food and goodies so you have time to browse and check out their selection :)> I would give this place 6/5 stars if I could - SO GOOD. Hands down, the best banh mi I have ever had in my life. I ordered the BBQ beef banh mi ($5.49) and a lychee smoothie ($3.99) thru uber eats ($1.99 delivery fee), and wished I had ordered another one. Prices are unbelievable for what you get, and the taste is unbeatable. The bread was crispy the way a baguette should be (should make a mess when you bite in, and this one def did), and the fillings (adequate amount of BBQ beef, cilantro, carrots, jalapeños that add a kick, pickled daikon) brought joy to my day. The lychee smoothie was sweet (can add boba, coffee jelly, or rainbow jelly to the smoothies at additional price), but not overly sweet, with a strong lychee taste.I will definitely order again and try other menu items!!> I came here after going to the JFK museum, and this was maybe a 30 minute walk away. The store has a lot of different food items pretty much everywhere: on the right I remember seeing dessert and drinks, on a table in the middle there were groceries, on the right there were pastries, and a place to order drinks, and in the back, a hot food bar and cashier. There were a few people (white people) who I stood in line with at the hot food counter, until being told by someone else in line that, if we wanted to order sandwiches, we had to go straight to the cashier. Keep that in mind if it's your first time here!I got the specialty banh mi and an avocado smoothie with boba. The banh mi came out super quickly, and although I waited maybe 15 minutes to eat it, it was super crispy, the vegetables were super fresh, and the meat (I don't remember what it was) was delicious as well. It was very cheap and filling too. Super good and definitely worth the walk.The avocado smoothie was also really good, and I don't know why it's so rare to find them on the east coast. The boba was soft and very sweet. However, and this might just be because avocadoes grow in Hawaii, where I usually drink my avocado smoothies, I think the smoothie with boba was like $5, which is twice what I'd usually pay, and also more than the price of like Jamba Juice and other overpriced chains. Maybe avocadoes are just more expensive in New England? Very good and comforting taste, but it was on the smaller side and kind of expensive.> I've had Banh Mi all across America and this one is definitely one of the top. The ingredients and the bread  is so fresh. I ordered the grilled BBQ beef option and I'm glad I did because apparently it's their best option. The portion size and flavor were both good for a $5 price.I also ordered the Thai tea, the tea is more on the not-sweet side but it's still refreshing. I'm also super excited to try their sugar cane juice. You have to find street parking to go here. The employees are nice but speak limited English so use hand gestures and speak clearly. They have good variety of both food and drinks. They prefer to not use AMEX cards because of the service fee but they can do it if that's all you have. There's no bathroom and no seating. This is a buy and go operation.> Part fast-food take out, part cafe, part grocery store with prepared foods. This place has it all!I came for the Vietnamese iced coffee (only $3.50, cash only) and left wishing that I ordered 2 more. Oh, and I also told my boyfriend to order me a spring roll and summer roll (both rolls come with 3 in an order). He ordered a banh mi sandwich and it was prepared so quickly and stuffed with meat and all the toppings. I was pretty jealous of his sandwich and regretting purchasing a bagel at another place.I really wanted to get the coffee again before we left Dorchester/Boston, but sadly never got the chance. Luckily 2 sets of friends live in this area so I imagine I will make this a must-stop place when I'm back in town!","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

The amount of food you get on a $10 curry special is staggering.Can't speak as to the authenticity of the recipes, but it's all delicious. There's one specific reason I enjoy their food: they use substantially less butter than many Indian restaurants. Less butter and less dairy means their food is lower in fat, has a cleaner taste and is more digestible. I feel healthy when I leave here. Full, but healthy.> This place used to be good two years ago, but that's not the case anymore. I bought the following things:1. Samosa: Have had much better ones elsewhere.2. Chhole Bathure: Same as #1, oily, and the gravy was too liquid-y.3. Baingan Bharta: Seemed to have more onion than eggplant.4. Tamarind Sauce: Felt like water with tamarind. Worst of the four things.> Don't let the dingy, small space of the establishment fool you. The food is amazing and tastes/looks authentically so. Everything comes on metal food trays, and the portions are HUGE. I ordered the Chicken Bharta (under the Dhaba Specials), which comes with naan and rice. The naan is some of the best I've had. It's thicker than what I'm used to (definitely not complaining) and chewy. The chicken came with roasted eggplant, green peas, bell peppers, and just the right blend of spices without being too spicy. I may have to order to-go next time in order to avoid accidentally hitting more butts during my meal. But I think I've found the Indian restaurant I'll be going to for awhile, so worth it!> Food was definitely overhyped and the upstairs was a bit smelly and dirty with a few tables that were not cleared. Staff was friendly but that's about it.The chicken was not the best qualityMango lassie was a bit too tangyFood was cold thanks to the dish they serve it on and did not look that appetizing Overall a disappointment and would not recommendDefinitely overhyped on yelp.> Got takeout from Punjabi Dhaba last night and it was some of the most delicious and reasonably priced Indian food I've ever had. In the chicken tikka  masala, the chicken was moist and almost fell apart, as opposed to the dry cubes that are in the dish in many other restaurants. The mango lassi was intense in flavor, and the naan had a nice bready flavor (although it was a tad dry). To be able to get great tasting Indian food for less than $10 for many dishes is a total find. I will be back many times, and hopefully try dining in as well.","4, 3, 5, 5, 2"

Oliveira's offers cheaper food (29 for all you can eat or around 9 per pound of food compared to around 50 at an upscale place). The meat itself is comparable. Olveira's seemed like it offers more variety as well. They have hot dishes such as beef stew with yuca and fish. Also included are a salad bar (included) and dessert section which is a la carte. The brigadeiros, cold chocolate and evaporated milk balls, are good, but over sweet. I also appreciated how you go to the churrasco area instead of them bringing it to you. Many times at Fogo or Texas de Brazil I had to aggressively wave down the meat people. One thing that is different is location. The area was cramped and the furniture looked old and slightly dirty. Also, some of the hot dishes were cold by the time I ate them.> not bad just really expensive i got rice and beans with 1 small piece of chicken it was almost 17 dollars that i could not understand> This is my favorite loxation out of this local chain of brazilian chusquerias.

I go to thd East Boston one. It was good food , but my last visita have been bad experience. The food is old (soggy potatoes that feel more than a day old, the meat is either raw or too cooked, the yellow plantains also old) .

It's truly a neighborhood restaurant that stands out from so many others in terms of friendliness, quality, and service.

So good! Food tasted very fresh, prepared and served perfectly. Neither I nor my friend were familiar with the cuisine, so the flavors were new to us, and were a delight to discover. Service was attentive, atmosphere comfortable. Highly recommend.> I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could. The ambiance of this place was strange. Glowing reviews and I assume it's for the food which was pretty good but man was the service bad. It's sad because service can really make or break a meal. The waitress looked like she hated her life the whole time. Rarely came back to check on us when we wanted to order more. We were also very thirsty throughout the whole meal, asked for water about three different times and didn't get any more water until she got us the check. Earlier we inquired about the ingredients of the pumpkin dish but the waitress ordered it for us anyway which was strange. Either way I will say the food was nice. I particularly enjoyed the chicken sausage and the traditional pie with cow cheese! I just don't know if I'd come all the way back to Newton for the experience as the food didn't outweigh the mediocre service.","5, 5, 4, 4, 3"

During the weekdays, there is a lunch special, 2 choices of meat with white rice and a house salad for just $9.95!I would recommend a reservation because you could end up waiting for over an hour!> I made a reservation for 6:30 PM and was not seated until 7:05 PM. Here how it played out. I checked in around 6:30 PM and the host told me they still need a few more minutes until my table was ready. My bf and I waited on the side, at 6:40 PM the host said my name in a whisper, then a couple who just walked through the door followed the host. I went up and asked if the host who checked me in called my name. She said, yes and said ""OMG she took the wrong people."" Then she told that host that she took the wrong people and the host who made the mistake didnt even look at me or apologize (she basically didnt care). Just a terrible host. How can she take a couple who did not even check in yet and her name was not even the same as mine? She cannot even say she made a mistake when I checked in with her face to face a few minutes ago?Food was good like always. Our waitress was very friendly and polite. We tried all the beef, pork belly, shrimp, and calamari. The calamari was a little slimy even after cooking... For veggies we went with mushroom and spinach. Everyone must try the spinach, it was surprisingly really good. For dessert, we got matcha ice-cream (incredible, really matcha-y), and smores.> I debated whether I should give Gyu-Kaku 3 or 4 stars. Settled on 3 stars because of a few things:This was my second time there and both experiences were pretty good. Ordered several small plates the first time and some tasted good while others were just ok. Did the BBQ the second time and went with the meat lovers option. The meat tasted great once we added some sauces. Did not like that the only dessert option was marshmallows for the BBQ. Wished they were kosher. Price is steep at $60 for two for the BBQ (with no beverage) but it's not a place I'd go more than once every couple of months. Service was ok. Pretty strict with accommodating substitutions. They pretty much said no to all requests. Even though we made reservations for early afternoon on a Saturday, we still had to wait 30 mins for a table. Parking is easy - there's the plaza lot and the free garage right there. Overall, a good experience.> This place is conveniently located right next to Saint Marys Street (green line).Upon arrival both the restaurant and the waiting area were packed so we could tell they're really popular. We heard a customer ask for wait time and it was over an hour, so definitely make a reservation ahead of time.Our reservation was for 6:45PM, but we arrived at 6:20PM and were seated within 15 minutes which allowed us time to peruse the menu. We also read their grill guide, but found it more convenient to just eyeball the meat to see when it's done.They have prix fixe courses and we opted for the $60 one (meal for two). It's also a great way to try out different meats - we ended up loving three and finding another three pretty meh, so now we'll know which type we're going to get in the future! The dipping sauce was amazing. We largely used the spicy sauce, which is what the server said is also the favorite for most customers.It ended up being way more food than we could finish so we definitely got our money's worth. Better yet, we downloaded their app which had a $10 off $30+ promotion going on for new users so we only ended up paying $50+tax.The service was great. Our server was super attentive despite how busy it was and came around to change our grill once it got charred. Only complaint was that the seats were quite old as our bench was pretty much tilted forward.> Wow the Brookline Gyu-Kaku for some reason or another is better than the Cambridge location. It's easier to hit up Gyu for lunch when the prices are cheaper (always a win) compared to dinner service. I also have never had issues walking in for lunch whereas if you plan to get dinner, you better have a reservation because the wait is always at least 90 minutes if you try to walk in.Try anything in their Shio White Soy sauce, I assure you it'll be unreal and of course load up on that Spicy Pork (between The Boy and I we at minimum get 3 orders). Round out your meal with some Spinach Garlic and Buttered Corn! I've also tried their seasonal chilled ramen, spicy chilled cucumbers, & shishito peppers. Great add-ons to your bbq. Pass on their Spicy Kalbi soup, it's a thin broth light on meat and veggies.","5, 2, 3, 5, 4"

Love the decor and almost has a divey feel to it. Haven't tried the food yet although doesn't look like a place where you'll go to grab a bite.> I am a regular at this establishment. Being a transplant from Miami, I absolutely love the old decor of the pub and the fact that it is walking distance from where I live. Paul, Johnny, Bob, and Ben all keep the beer flowing as well as the conversation, which is why I wanted to take my girlfriend and a good friend of mine there yesterday. Since it was a busy Saturday, we waited at the bar for a table to open up and took a seat about an hour after being there. This is where everything got bad real quick:We closed our tab and sat at the table, thinking we would be helped by the server I saw walk passed me about a hundred times (as well as rudely bump into me a thousand times without apologizing once) but, after about 45 minutes of sitting patiently, I noticed the server (now I know their name is Carry, Carrie, or Kerry, who cares) was only walking up and down the narrow bar in order to get to the front door to leave and smoke cigarettes. I counted about 5 times within the 2 hours I was there, and these were not quick cigarettes, usually a really nice session. In order to paint even more of a portrait of the amazing service we received, our favorite server (Carry, -arrie, -erry) at one point came up to our table (the first time they interacted with us) with two cold Guinness, asking if they were for us. You know you're not good at your job when your customers have to tell you to turn around and serve it to the couple that has been drinking the same beer all night in the corner of the restaurant. Of course, our server wouldn't know that because as they were outside puffing on tar sticks and making sure their shirt underneath their shirt was still cuffed properly, the bartenders had to get up from their post and do the servers job for them. Last but not least, Carry-arrie-erry, came to our table for the first and only time, asking ""are you waiting on me for anything?"" not ""can I help you? Sorry I haven't been around"" not ""Do you need a refill?"" which was a bad start. I bit my tongue and looked at my beer to see if I needed a refill and as I opened my mouth, I was interrupted and asked if I had a tab open at the bar, to which I said ""well yes"" to which they turned around and walked away. THE FUNNY THING IS I HAD TO REOPEN MY TAB BECAUSE I HAD NOT BEEN GREETED BY MY SERVER FOR OVER AN HOUR. I hope this wonderful server is reading this so they learn a lesson to treat every customer with the same amount of respect. I own two bars in one of the most popular areas in Miami, as well as an English degree, which makes me excellent at writing reviews for restaurants. If you do not want to treat people with an open heart in the hospitality industry (especially if they have done absolutely nothing to warrant disrespect, as we have all experienced rude customers before) then just don't work in hospitality. You are losing the bar money and doing nothing to help your own personal growth. Again, I love Sevens because it is my local pub, but it makes it near-impossible to go back on a busy night like that if all I'm going to get is a metaphorical face full of tobacco scented spit from my server and treated like a criminal for no reason. Quit smoking will ya.","4, 3, 5, 4, 1"

The atmosphere is bright and open with a lively yet chill ambiance. There is patio seating as well, which looked lovely! We were able snag a table for 6 on Saturday (the day of) but only because we were hotel guests. I was expecting extremely overpriced, mediocre hotel food but was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case! In terms of food, I ordered the Buddha bowl (with an egg) which I do NOT recommend. It was very small with only a few chickpeas and pretty flavorless. Also, it was not filling at all. However, everyone else in my party seemed to enjoy their food. I had a few bites of the outlook burger, which was delicious! The prices were decent, especially for a hotel restaurant.Overall, I would still return as I really liked the ambiance/service but I reccomend ordering anything other than the buddha bowl.> This is the downstairs restaurant associated with the Envoy hotel. I came here for breakfast and lunch while on a business trip. For  breakfast I got their lobster eggs Benedict. It was heavenly. They also had Earl gray tea which was a nice plus and the link sausages on the side were excellent. I couldn't really try their breakfast potatoes because there was so much food. They put a very generous helping of lobster and the eggs were cooked perfectly. For lunch I was eyeing their salmon platter but the hostess told me that it would take 15-20 mins to cook but the ahi tuna sandwich would come out much sooner. Since I was in a time crunch I got the ahi tuna sandwich. It was good as well, but a bit too heavy with bacon and the aoli sauce. The bread was toasted perfectly though, so no complaints.> Nice Decor, modern.  Not busy on a Sunday for brunch.  Live music (acoustic guitar).  Laid back.Cons:  Beer was served in a dirty glass.  this should never happen.  Staff needs to pay attention to detailPros:  the Outlook burger was very good, cooked as ordered.

Citrus 2 is a good choice for those that want something refreshing with a slight kick.> Walk down the stairs of 288 Newbury and you'll find yourself in a brightly lit space with plant products known as Pressed Juicery. I had a good experience coming here. the staff were friendly and helped me decide what to try and what toppings I wanted to get for my plant-based soft serve. The ice cream alternative was good but I do prefer the creaminess of good old fashion ice cream. I guess as a stand alone product it does satisfy the same cravings but it's quite expensive for the same amount of ice cream. I am hoping that these plant based option could be more of a fro-yo style pay by weight style service. The juices are good and I've had a couple fo the juices but Green#4 is my favorite. It took some time to get used to the taste but after a while it became my favorite.Overall, I am not too sure if I'd go to pressed juice on a daily basis. I found overall that their product and packaging is good but it's pricey and is more of a treat than a go to spot.> I am not really into juices, but I was really glad to give this place a try (thanks to yelp's check-in event!) I got a freeze ( a healthy alternative to ice cream) and a juice (citrus 2). I thought the freeze was just okay, but I have a huge sweet tooth so probably not that cut out for vegan ice cream. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my juice-- I found it to be really refreshing that I downed the whole thing in a few gulps!! If you are a health nut, I can see why you would love this place. They have a variety of options to satisfy all sorts of tastebuds! However, for people who are less inclined, I can see this place being a tad too expensive. But I do appreciate having this place as a healthier alternative to ice cream or smoothies/sugary drinks and my visit has made me more mindful of the ways that I can try to healthier!> Had a pleasant experience during one of the yelp events. Received a juice and a ice cream for free which is always lovely :) I had the green juice #4. It was very tasty. I love cayenne pepper in all my green juices to give it an extra kick. However, I don't love the fact that they are premade. I like my juices made fresh in front of me and being able to customize them. The ice cream was yummy for how healthy it was. I had the vanilla with chocolate drizzle, cookie crumble, chocolate chips. Definitely preferred it over halo or other healthy icecreams. They actually have a nice comparison chart on the wall comparing ingredients of theirs to other brands! Although my order was free, prices seemed fairly inexpensive compared to other juice bars.> Really friendly staff and a beautiful store! I love ice cream so I was skeptical at the idea of ""vegan"" ice cream but it was absolutely delicious (I got the chocolate/vanilla swirl) and I topped it with blueberries, granola, and raspberry drizzle.The juices are also great but I really only tried a couple. The Greens 3 was very drinkable and I definitely felt good afterward.The only thing I didn't love is that their membership was confusing. They seemed to tell me that there were no fees but that's only if you spend $10/month (which go towards items you buy there).","5, 3, 3, 4, 4"

However it is moreso they change certain items - not all! We got many many dishes and they were all pretty tasty. I would say the least favorite was the yuca fries. They have a bar to drink at and a kitchen bar to eat at. Despite liking all of that, I am giving it four stars because it is definitely not the quality of food I'd expect (a lot of it is frozen).

I could see how they were evoking breakfast flavors, while still keeping the Asian rice noodle with veggie base.The chile sauce on the side did a lot for it too. It was good, but very filling, and a tad greasy. It would be an awesome hangover food. Coffee wasn't great- so I would come caffeinated.> This place was recommended to me by 2 different people.

My usual go-to place is Chinatown cafe. However, I was closer to Wai Wai one day and decided to stop by.Very small restaurant hidden in a really dark side street. Their menu is on the counter. They have a few combos to choose from. The lady speaks enough English to understand your order. Their chicken and duck are really tender. LOVE the ginger scallion sauce they put on your rice. I could just eat rice with that sauce and be happy. The only down side I have is that they do not give you very much meat at all. And their prices are a little higher, over $8. However these prices are to be expected with the rent increases in Chinatown. Prices of food increase, but quantity and quality of food decrease. (Y'all can blame gentrification for that).> For all the hype, I wasn't impressed at all with this meal. We ordered two combo plates with duck, roast pork, bbq pork. Both plates were topped with the scallion sauce. The dish was extremely oily, the pieces of duck we were given barely had any meat so they were practically just duck bones, and the roast pork had basically no skin. The amount of meat given compared to the rice portion is so off. There are places in Chinatown and Quincy that I feel the quality is just as good if not better; better priced and with better selection of pieces. I would come back as it wasn't a bad meal, but would not choose this over other options of the same dish.> Hidden from the main streets of Chinatown, Wai Wai sits in the basement on Oxford street near several other smaller storefronts. It really is what you would think of when the words hole-in-a-wall comes up. Quick things to note: Cash only!With that aside, the thing that they seem to pride themselves over is their white-cut chicken (白切雞) as this is actually written on their store sign. This is something that I do not see as commonly served at restaurants around here, however, it is a very common way for my family and other Guangdong families to do so. The cooking method involves poaching the chicken whole in non-boiling water until it is fully cooked. It is usually shocked in cold water in order to firm up the skin. The resulting product is a tender, moist chicken with firm and bouncy skin without being overly oily. When ordering, you can choose from a variety of meats that they have over rice. The rice is drizzled with a seasoned soy sauce, then topped with the meat(s) of your choice, and that is topped with a ginger/scallion mixture. Keep in mind that the meats are cooled. When dining in, you also get a small bowl of soup which usually seems to be made from the leftover chicken necks and feet. Great simple broth that goes along well with the rice dishes. When craving a good plate of chicken and rice, this is definitely the one place that I'd like to come to for simple home-like cooking. Also remember, you can ask them to make items boneless if you like as well as white versus dark meat if you have a preference.> Been 20 years since I last eaten there & thankfully nothing changed. Table clothe are still dirty, cups & plates are still chipped, but the food still reigns supreme.  In town for few days & brought a few Bay Area friends to sample their famous wai wai chicken & it was very satisfying.We ordered the double treasure rice combo: wai wai chicken & roast pork over rice, it was fantastic! The roast pork was succulent, with right amount of fat & crispy skin. The finely sliced chicken was tender & has good natural flavor, skin & bones attached which is the appropriate Cantonese style. The ginger & scallion sauce on top was the perfect complement for the chicken. They also poured sauce (juices from the meat?) over the rice and it was heavenly. Even for someone from the Bay Area it's rare to have such fresh chicken, the owner chef has been here for nearly 40 years & they have not changed their method: use only freshly ""prepared"" chickens, this is not your frozen KFC or chick-a-filet. Overall Wai Wai is one of a few dying gems in Chinatown. The owner hinted he will retire in the next few years, hopefully it will still be here next time I m in Boston.> At first glance, this place looks sketchy, dirty, and you're unsure if you're there to buy food or accidentally walked into someone's home,  welcome to waiwai. This is the classic ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" situation. I've visited this establishment multiple times whenever I'm home sick. Their 三寶飯 (three treasure rice?) is my go to choice there, don't think I've tried anything else. From middle school to now i noticed their quality slowly go down, same great taste but meat to rice ratio was off. Maybe it's due to the location as Chinatown rent is always increasing due to gentrification. I will continue coming here when I have a craving for it.","4, 3, 5, 4, 3"

Super cute and private. I would suggest street parking out in the maIn road as the parking there were pretty pricey.> I wouldn't say this is an easy location by car. We had a difficult time finding street parking. There are parking spots in front of the restaurant; however, they were all taken. My family and I came on a rainy day, though, the delicious food made up for the weather! We arrived before the kitchen opened, yet the host was able to seat us. I recommend making a reservation in advance because it gets busy rain or shine. Our service was fairly good, but you can tell he was a new hire and was his first shift. He forgot a couple drinks and orders, but that's okay! The menu was quite limited, although, a party of ten was 100% satisfied. Many of us ordered lobster rolls, burgers, clam chowder, oysters, mimosas and coffee.> I want to like Pier 6 so badly - that's most likely why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The location is beautiful, they have a free water shuttle that runs back and forth to their sister restaurant the reel house (in the summer) & the patio is beautiful. That said, the past 3 times I've been there the service has been horribly slow. On Sunday, January 12th 2020, it was 60+ degrees in Boston so we headed to pier 6 for lunch, only to be brought down by disappointment. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, totally fine! But during this time my father was at the bar trying to order drinks with little success. After 10 minutes we were brought to our table where we watched the waitresses VERY slowly walk around the restaurant & help other tables. Just to clarify, by ""very slowly"" I mean, mozy-ing (unsure if that is a word). After 20-ish minutes of no one visiting our table, not even popping over to say ""sorry, be with you in a minute"", we decided it was time to go, hungry & thirsty. (Ubered 1.2 miles to the Monument Restaurant & Tavern, in Charleston - great place!) Pier 6 is in such a great location & has such a stunning porch, they should have properly staffed the restaurant to accommodate the incredible weather... the 60+ degrees was the only thing Bostonians talked about the entire week!!!  Like I said, I really want to like Pier 6 but I will not be returning (which sucks).> A fancy place with fancy food and a fancy view.I came here for my birthday, and it did not disappoint. My order: 3 oysters, lobster roll, margarita.Oysters were yummy, and came with three varieties of toppings- vinegar type thing, cocktail sauce with extra horseradish, and lemon. Lobster roll came with fries- which were absolutely delicious- not greasy, yet maintained that crispy potato outside that we all yearn for in a fry. The roll was definitely good. Mostly claw meat, which I don't have a problem with- but for you, the reader, that might vary. It was basically lobster bits and melted butter- none of that mayo-stuffed lobster salad. The bread was also delicious- crispy and buttery. Drinks were delicious (13/14$) i had a cocktail with my oysters called the pink drink- tasted like boozy lemonade- delicious with oysters.Second drink was a frozen margarita- also good.The view is what makes this place special. It is located right on Pier 6, and has panoramic views of the harbour and the city. I strongly recommend reservation.Wait staff was lovely.I am also adding pics of my friend's' orders- they were all satisfied with their meals> Ambiance was great, service was good, food was not enjoyable. From the drinks we ordered (all overly sweet) to the dry waaay over salted ravioli (also cost over 20 dollars), we left underwhelmed. Come for the amazing views and good service but don't have high expectations in the other departments. We ordered a basket of fries to start, crispy and cooked well. After that, we order the avocado toast (tasted like it was drenched in olive oil), salmon (best dish but still MEH), butternut squash ravioli (over priced/over seasoned/undercooked) and the beet salad (seriously bad and very strange). I would not recommend this place for a foodie but it's nice for a date where you are craving some quiet views of the city and want to enjoy it over a glass of wine! The food and drinks are way overpriced and you even need to pay for parking. I won't be back.","5, 5, 2, 5, 3"

It's on the side entrance of the Super 88 market. I've passed it a couple times, but finally decided to try it. I think this place is better than the Ganku Itteksu ramen place in Brookline because the broth is SO much more rich in flavor. I got the Kakara Men ramen on the menu, and it was probably one of the best bowls of ramen I've had. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the soft boiled egg was delicious and creamy and the broth was perfect. I am extremely happy to have found this place because it's so good and reasonably priced. The bowls ranged from $11-14 depending on what kind of ramen. The atmosphere: the place itself is quite small, it gives me a hole-in-the-wall vibe. The service was excellent and quick. The only thing I thought was weird was that they couldn't substitute different toppings although they were the same price...> This was the second time we came to this ramen shop. The first time we came here the menu was only 1 page front and back but now they offer more options to choose from. The staff are very attentive and nice. Food comes out fairly quickly and hot. Over all, a good spot to get ramen in the Allston area. -spicy chicken - the chicken here is so good, is well seasoned and fried perfectly. It's paired with a spicy mayo sauce that's a little more on the sweet side with a little citrusy taste- ika geso - fried octopus that aren't chewy at all. They are fried in a light batter and served with a side of lemon and mayo which-Isshindo ramen - my go to ramen choice here. Portions here are very filling. The egg tastes so good. The only thing I don't like is that they char the pork and it becomes a little dry -spicy paitan ramen - new ramen option. Pretty spicy and is served with fried chicken. Good combo but chicken does get soggy if you don't eat fast enough> Ganko Ittetsu's Tan Tan ramen is my personal favorite.  However, Isshindo's Tan Tan is a close second.  In fact Isshindo wins with the larger serving size, including a full egg (two halves).  Take note, Ganko Ittestu!  That being said, it was a packed house and everyone's soup looked great.  People were smiling and slurping away, luxuriating in their ramen umami on this raw and rainy February day. I struck up a conversation with the lovely couple next to me who ordered the spicy miso ramen and the spicy tonkatsu ramen.  They were regulars who ate there once a week who couldn't stop raving.  You know the ramen was great when you are sad to finish it.Isshindo is a worthy addition to Boston's ramen scene.> Great lunch place to stop by for a few minutes. We went here for a dinner from a friend's recommendation. The ambiance is quite uninviting. Many restaurants like this are tight but this one just felt extra claustrophobic, dated decorations, very uncomfortable chairs & tables, I really doubt anyone would choose to stay longer than 20 minutes. Not a big deal for a quick lunch, but for dinner, not off to a good start.We ordered a hot tea, their signature Isshindo ramen dish, and the miso ramen dish with chicken instead of pork. Let me say this first- prices are AMAZING, $11.50 for each bowl, (which really does fill you up)! However, you get what you pay for. Firstly, my hot tea is served in a plastic cup (which you would serve water or soda in) and it was one measly 10 cent paper teabag of some really cheap stuff. Slap in the face. The soup portions were really great, but it was just too simple. The flavors are all there, broth has amazing body, noodles great, pork was thick and juicy, but that's all you get. The most interesting thing on their signature dish was the egg, which stood out among the other flavors and brightened things up, but it's gone in 1-2 bites. To their credit, you can add other ingredients like extra egg, bamboo, etc... but don't you think at least their signature dish should be a display of their best culinary creativity + finesse? Why should it be up to the consumer to decide what toppings are NECESSARY to turn a good dish to a great dish? I would rather pay $15 and have a fantastic bowl than $11.50 and have it be ""almost-there.""Another small detail- they charged us $3 extra for the chicken substitute. Now, given that the prices are already so cheap, I would have been OK with this charge if they told us BEFOREHAND. However, we did not find out until the bill came. ouch.If I eat here again, it will likely be on a quick lunch break if I'm in the area. I think it will be an awesome spot for that application.> After hot yoga at the Corepower across the street, you might find yourself venturing over to Isshindo Ramen for a hot, steamy, and scrumdiddlyumptious bowl of ramen. This ramen promised land is conveniently located next to the Super88 Market and Kung Fu Tea with parking available for their customers. Upon arrival, as I was browsing the menu, I noticed many of the options contained pork broth, but have no fear there was couple vegetarian and chicken options- shout out to those with dietary restrictions! I ordered the Spicy Paitan Ramen- a six-hour chicken broth with onion, bamboo shoot, wood ear mushrooms, fried crispy chicken & soy egg. This was a meal that I can compare to ambrosia, the food of the gods. I'd highly recommend it to anyone! Now, I completely understand why this restaurant has such great Yelp reviews.","5, 4, 4, 3, 5"

I can find them whenever I want and the hours are really great! 11:30am every day? 9:30 most weeknights? 10:30pm on Friday & Saturday night? Thank You! The fried chicken sandwich is one of the best I've found in Boston and the fresh cut French fries are Also definitely worthy of checkin out:Mac & Cheese, Smoked Chicken, Pulled Pork, Corn Bread & The Pretzel.> I've always had my eye out for M&M, and I finally got around to trying their bbq. I got the bone-in plate, which comes with a half rack of ribs, half chicken, baked beans and a corn muffin for $38. With a price like that, my expectations were high.Ribs: They tasted fine, but were really tough and didn't have a lot of meat on them compared to other spare ribs I've had. I'm hoping I just got a bad batch. This was a huge letdown, as this is mainly what I was interested in and supposedly what they're known for. Chicken: Good. Some parts were dry, but overall satisfying.Beans: Amazing. Not sure what they put in these things but they're incredible.Corn bread (muffin): Standard. Nothing to write home about.Overall it wasn't what I was expecting but I would certainly be willing to give them another shot when COVID is over and I can go eat/drink at the new location.> Had a not so good experience at M&M BBQ on Saturday night at Dorchester Brewing Company. Restaurant not too busy, despite brewery filled to capacity. First problem, at the order counter we had issues with an extremely unfriendly and unhelpful server / order taker. We had questions on substitutions / adds, she doesn't answer the question but instead starts typing in the order into her system. When the sandwich (which was replacing meat for a veggie option, which should be an even substitute if not less) increased in price from $11 to $17, we were surprised and questioned why that was and if it was a mistake. The answer we received was ""that's just how we do it."" Extremely unhelpful and rude. Next, as I mentioned the restaurant had plenty of workers and wasn't extremely busy. Our orders took 20-25 minutes to come out, which was unfortunate as we were hungry and wanted to eat quickly. Food was fine when it finally came, nothing special. We already had a bad taste in our mouth after the wait and rude service that we weren't necessarily excited to get the food. 2/5 overall, likely would not go back and/or recommend.> It was bittersweet when Dorchester Brewing Co. remodeled and integrated M&M bbq. Bitter because we could no longer BYOF. Sweet because the food is good! I would say the bbq chicken is pretty dry but the sauce is delish as are the sides we got and the dumpster fries. Portions are large and this heavy food goes perfectly with the more bitter, sour beers on tap at the brewery.> Nice addition to Dorchester Brewing- who doesn't want some easily-accessible and tasty BBQ with their beer?We were there the day before their grand opening, so they didn't quite have their systems or timing worked out perfectly yet and the ordering and wait time were a bit muddled- but that will likely improve with time. The pulled pork sandwich had little sauce (just a bit brushed on the potato bun, I think) but still managed to be pretty flavorful and not dry- I did detect a bit of a kick (cayenne?), so it's not 100% mild FYI (I personally prefer my BBQ heat from mustard instead, but to each his own). The fried chicken thigh sandwich was crispy but juicy and also flavorful, topped with some tasty pickles, and was the clear crowd favorite in our group. The skin-on fries have potential, but were a bit soggy and cold by the time they got to us (although probably are excellent when fresh), and instead of ketchup they give you BBQ sauce to dip them in. I recall from trying them at a past Beer & BBQ fest that their ribs are good, but they were out when we were there.Prices are good for sandos, portions are sufficient without being too overwhelming or too tiny, access is easy (don't even have to step outside). I bet they'll do very well as part of the brewery- beer and BBQ is an excellent match.","5, 3, 2, 4, 4"

It is the perfect amount of chicken and not too much breading on the chicken. They offer fries, Cole slaw, Texas toast and their signature Canes dipping sauce which are all delicious! You can ask to substitute the Cole slaw for toast or another Canes sauce.They offer the usual drinks as well as unsweet or sweet iced tea which are so good.The hours here change based on the times of the nearby university so check to see if they're open at 9 PM or until 12 AM.The staff are very friendly. We come a couple times a month and it never disappoints!> I was looking forward to this place for months. Passing by it on the B line each time and envisioning some southern hospitality with carefully selected seasonings and batches of crispy chicken cooked to perfection. The advertising is just that - really good advertising to grab you in. I will admit, it's nice being able to order by the chicken finger. Usually I'd expect a 4-6 piece minimum. And, the portion they give you is well worth the size.Here are the downfalls. Let's first start with the fries. I call these the ""almost there fries"". They just needed to be crisped more for texture and taste. Doesn't help either when trying to dip them in ketchup and snap in half before I can reach the Heinz. It was also a little oily.As for the fingers/tenders (as initially I thought there would be bone in), it's too greasy. It's very similar to KFC. When I want tenders, I want that deep fried, feel it to the core chicken wholesomeness. The batter - while fried well - slips off the chicken too easily and you're left with just bare naked chicken. And the taste again is a bit oily. The chipotle sauce too had a bit of a kick but also was a let down. It's just another one of those ""fast food greasy establishments"". Sometimes for the food you want, you really have to go down to the part of the country the palate comes from. At least it was worth a shot and can say been there, done that.> I had been here once many years before when my son was interviewing with a out-of-state college rep at the coffee shop next door. As I recall, I enjoyed it and recommended it to my husband. I was at a BU theater production that was close by and just smelling this place while walking by brought back that first memory. After the show, the smell was too enticing and I just had to have some (maybe not having dinner had something to do with it too).The strips are tender and juicy. The fries are crispy and the toast is a weird choice but it works. The lemonade was pretty good as well - not too sweet. This is the definition of a guilty pleasure.> I'm clearly not understanding something. Came here for lunch with my boyfriend and got the 4 Finger Combo. It tasted...like chicken? I'd honestly rather have any other chicken place: Popeyes, Chik-Fil-A even. Nothing really popped out as a wow. The breading wasn't special tasting, and neither were the fries or the Texas Toast. I feel like I've had better frozen versions of both. Does that make me too trashy or too boujee for this place? What does it mean? T____T I personally won't be coming back, unless I wanted their sweet tea.> Especially for a hungry student on the go, this place is perfect for a filling, affordable comfort food meal. They fry the chicken to order so it comes out fresh, light and crispy. The skinny crinkle cut fries are amazing and impossible to stop eating. Oddly enough my favorite part was the buttered Texas toast. GUYS, IT WAS PERFECT. It's so thick that it's still so soft in the middle and generously buttered, and anyone who knows me knows I LOVE butter more than anything. Just incredible.The one thing I didn't love was the sauce. It wasn't flavorful and didn't add anything to the meal, I wish I had just gotten the honey mustard.It can get pretty busy around lunch time and after work, but they crank out your food very quickly. Always worth a stop!","5, 2, 4, 3, 4"

The bento comes with a lot of food, so I was going to say it's really worth it.

I've been cooking almost exclusively at home now but make the exception to venture out for Fin's. Their lunch bento boxes are such a good deal and comes with a lot of food. Here's a picture of my cat enjoying a piece of your salmon.> I ordered Fin's for delivery and it was awful! I used to eat here in college and thought the sushi was good but my husband and I barely touched our food last night.The spicy seafood fried rice was absolutely terrible. The shrimp that came in it were the only edible thing. The scallops and other seafood mixed in were very chewy and just didn't taste good at all. The rice was very bland and unflavored. Very frustrating because it is expensive and sounded delicious when I ordered it.The sushi rolls were underwhelming and overpriced. I wouldn't recommend the fire maki.

I attended the brunch and had the bratwurst and curry wurst with eggs. Both sausages were tasty, of good size, and clearly custom madE rather than produced industrially . The sauerkraut was like what you would get in Germany. The had a great beer selection on tap and in bottles and cans. I was imppressed that they had many of the different styles of German beers on tap including the expected Pilsner and Hefeweizen, but also koelsch (2types), a sour and a German IPA on tap. Good atmosphere as well (decor and utensils) and we had great service. I would recommend this place   highly to folks like me who lived in Germany and want to take a culinary walk down memory lane.> Go here for the beer list; stay for the food. In all honesty, having spent some time in Germany, this place is not super authentic - and that's okay! The beer menu is awesome - over 100 German, Austrian, and Polish brews, and a good amount are on draught. I personally enjoy the $7 ""mystery beer"" if I'm having a hard time choosing, and the liter of ""das boot"" of the house Weinstephaner is always fun. I love the glassware, it feels very European. The food is pretty good - but not as authentic as you might hope. We got the schnitzel and spaetzel and it was as others described in their reviews, a fusion of German and America fare. The ambiance is really cozy, the staff are friendly and attentive. Definitely a solid place to visit.> I've spent a little quality time in Germany... so let me tell you this: German food is nothing if not bold and heavy on the flavors. [Some] Germans refer to American beer as spülwasser (rinse water). I was able to try the charcuterie, sauerbraten, a piece of pierogi, the donut dessert, and Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche beer.About the charcuterie, these are some awesome sausages! Sure, they're only slices, but the flavor didn't go anywhere. The variety is good without being too overwhelming. Though I would have liked a bit more candied bacon, then again, I love candied bacon! The sauerbraten was, well, ""Sauer"" but still good. The meat was very tender, cooked perfectly, and full of bold flavors from the braising. The black cherry bbq sauce was in the perfect amount, and while I personally would have liked a little less sour, who am I kidding, I knew what I signed up for. The halusky potato pasta was good and did its role of adding a starch element to the dish. What was sorely missing was a fresh element to balance out the rather heavy meats, fats, and starches.The bite I had of my friend's veggie pierogi was good! Cooked nicely with great flavors. The donuts were good! Not something you get at Dunkies, but a more fork and knife based dessert. I also opted for the chocolate topping, since, well, it's hard to say no to chocolate. Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche beer: great stuff! Not too heavy, but oh so amazingly smokey. It's a good thing I didn't get a second bottle though, for it was bloody expensive!That's my only real gripe. The food was certainly great, but it felt a little heavy on the wallet. The beer, as an example: I fully understand that restaurants can't sell at cost, but a ~$5-6 beer selling for $17, that's a bit steep. The service was very nice and polite, and the location was clean (and had a cool vibe!)> Food was decent. Pierogi's kind of tasted like a super doughy Americanized empanada. 2 huge empanadas-sorry, pierogis-were 21 dollars. Soft pretzel appetizer was excellent but the mustard it came with was SO spicy it was virtually inedible. Cheese dipping sauce was good, but a bit curdled and separated. Drinks were good. Beer flight was very good. Burger was probably an 8 out of 10. Server was grouchy and annoyed. Not very pleasant, but I do understand we were a party of 4 that hasn't seen each other in a while and we were probably tough to interact with. Nonetheless, her attitude was unpleasant. Really cool medieval German/polish ambiance. I think the ambiance is the coolest part of this establishment. It's definitely a ""wow"" factor. You walk in and kind of gasp at how cool all the velvet chairs and lighting is. Dinner for 4 came to about 200 dollars before tip. 50/50 shot of returning.> The ambience of the restaurant was definitely very German, from the type of furniture, to the choice of décor. It definitely adds to the whole German food experience. The restaurant isn't huge, but there were a lot of people in there! Definitely make a reservation advance before going, as I can see the wait being pretty long. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered, especially the charcuterie plate and the spätzle. Bronwyn's charcuterie plate with items such as fried beef tongue and rabbit liver mousse is definitely for those who are adventurous. I strongly recommend the charcuterie plate as the items are very unique and were all delicious! I was very satisfied with my spätzle as it was fragrant with the smell of shallots and extremely cheesy, just the way I like it! Someone ordered the Wurst Trio and I kept stealing her potatoes as they had a very crisp exterior with a soft tender center, it was also very fragrant (probably cooked with animal fat!).Overall, a great experience with delicious food and cheerful service.","5, 4, 4, 3, 4"

They still have my favorite fish & chips in the city (seriously, the entire plate is perfection), their Scottish beer and scotch offerings can't really be found anywhere else, they offer a ton of fun special events (scotch tastings, various dinners, cheese nights) in addition to their regularly-scheduled dining experience, and I amend my previous statement: they are indeed one of the coziest restaurants around. I love supporting neighborhood places anyway, but the quality, price, and experience here are all excellent and worth the trek even if you're not nearby.  I also love that it's rare not to see the owner Jason around, greeting guests and helping front of house out wherever he can- clearly he cares about his restaurant and his patrons, and it shows. This is a place you definitely want to add to your rotation.> We were told that we did not need to say we wanted our scotch neat, but no one trusted it (I checked with whisky loving friends later and we all agreed that I will say neat so as to not ruin anything you order). Of course, a great selection. I ended up getting the vegetarian curry and, while thinking there was no way I would eat all of it, I did because it was so damn good. We also had some mini veggie pies to start which were also really good. However, I'm never sure the price is worth it here, which is why I don't go as much as my stomach might want.> Both the pros and the cons of cozy - but with good food to boot! We came in with a reservation and had to wait a little while - and there really isn't anywhere to wait. The bar was packed and I could tell we were driving the servers nuts, but it was freezing so didn't really see any alternatives.Once we sat, we had a great experience. The food was really good, and service was great too. I wouldn't normally have picked the scallops, but I saw someone eating them at the bar - and they were so good! Everyone around me was happy too though, so I doubt you can make a mistake here.> I can not wait until I can go back to this establishment- the food is soooo delicious- best burger ever and the fish and chips is the best I've had. And Scotch! Scotch!> If you're in Jamaica Plain, and it's a little late...you're not really in the mood to eat a filling meal but you want to munch on SOMETHING. A little greasy, a lotta satisfying -- get yourself into Haven and order a side of their steak fries and wash it down with one of their Irish beers on draft. The ketchup is made in-house too. Super tasty. I've also had the burger here, which has been recognized before as one of the best burgers in Boston. It's simple, juicy and full of beefy goodness. The rest of the menu was intriguing too. There were plenty of dishes on the menu that included only what I imagine to be authentic Irish comfort food. Irish I tried other things as well, but alas, my wallet cries 'no'.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

Think of it as Mediterranean food gone ""chipotle style.""Walked in and they weren't busy. We were helped out right away. My friend and I both ordered a plate each. His plate was pork with tzatziki sauce, along with fries on top. This also consisted of onions and tomato. I ordered a grilled chicken plate with lemon yogurt, and with fries on top. The fries had feta cheese crumbled on top as well. It was also accompanied by tomato and onions. Delicious! The foood was delicious! He paid about $37 for two plates and two drinks. The employees were all friendly and the inside was super clean.. We were even offered some free dessert... couldn't say no and so happy I accepted the offer. We were given chocolate covered loukoumades and omggggg heaven right there.... Ohhh guys please come to arizonaaaaa!> Haley wanted to order from GreCo, don't each much Greek food but gave it a try anyways! We ordered delivery, arrived in Southie super quickly from the seaport. I ordered a chicken Greco classic, which came with chicken / onions / hand cut potatoes. Surprisingly the combination worked, very tasty on a nice flatbread pita. Tastes were solid, flatbread held together extremely well, and was a great portion. Also ordered a side of fries, very good as well. Haley also enjoyed her sandwich and ordered a salad to eat later on as well. Overall, enjoyed the food and would order again. Probably would need to be in the mood for Greek to order again, couldn't eat everyday. 4/5!> The Classic Pork Gyro is better than the lamb.  As far as the Dips with Pita, the charred eggplant is the best as well as the Tzatziki (skip the Spicy Feta, Greek Fava and Pepper Paprika).  The Pea Protein Keftedes are fine.  I was not a huge fan of the zucchini chips; nothing wrong with them they just didn't wow me like some other reviews suggested. The Bougatsa Loukoumas doughnut holes are also pretty tasty.> Excellent food with excellent service. This is such a great option for a fast casual meal in the seaport ! All of Demetri's restaurants are out of this world - the flavors the vibe and the experience!> I am obsessed!I stopped by at lunchtime, and the line was wrapped around, but they are a well oiled machine and moved the line so quickly. I ordered the Mediterranean salad with spicy feta and chicken, and it blew me away. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The quality was something I would expect from a sit down restaurant. The workers were so friendly and happy, too, and their energy was contagious!Don't let a long line deter you if you're in the area. It'll go quick and is 100% worth the wait!","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"

This lobsTer roll with homemade slaw is enough to fall in love and never leave !! Delicious> Very sad. OK shrimp cocktail. Dry as a bone corn bread app. Weird rigatoni main with way too much tasteless braised beef.  I know many people might say that it's impossible to have too much braised beef. However, I shared my main with a foodie who also thought it was sub par. The mouse running around the tables was the last straw.> Just did a quick stop here to get out of the heat and snag a couple beers.  Very neat interior and an incredibly friendly and welcoming staff.  Our bartender was engaging and attentive and we really enjoyed our brief time here and everyone we interacted with...had the oysters and they were excellent.Will swing by for longer and more food in the future so stay tuned.> For a tavern, which I usually don't frequent, I love this place. Nice interior atmosphere with dark hardwood floors, black leather seats, dim lighting but not too dark, tall tables with prominent but not too big of a bar. Wherever I go, if I see sweet potato fries on the menu, I order them. These are the BEST I've had... maybe ever. Cut fresh and perfectly golden. An order is like 2-3 portions to me. Absolutely delicious at a decent price. Oh yes, and they have Bell's Oberon on draft!  I lived in Michigan and it's Michigan's best. I haven't seen it in a liquor store, let alone on draft, here in Boston. Definitely try out Granary. It's located on the Boston Greenway and has outdoor seating for the summer. High fives, Granary.> I went here for brunch and it was perfect! It's in a very central spot in the city of Boston, easy to get to! We got the corn beef hash, lobster eggs bene, French toast, and my person favorite shrimp cocktail! The service was very attentive and friendly. Their Irish coffee was delicious, just strong as a warning.","5, 2, 3, 5, 5"

My co-workers and I went to A&B Burgers on a weekday for lunch and the restaurant was packed. This could have contributed to why the wait for everything was slow from being seated, to putting in our orders to getting our food, check, and to-gos. However, if you have time on your band and you're not in a rush, the food and atmosphere is phenomenal. It should be a surprise that the restaurant is known for their burgers. One of my coworker boasted that A&B Burgers has the second best burgers in Boston. I was skeptical unit I bit into my Hangover Burger. And of course you don't need a hangover to try their Hangover Burger though you may need a place to have a nap after.The Hangover burger is loaded with breakfasty kind of goodness. Beef patty, fried egg, bacon and cheese. Did I leave out any ingredients? As if that's not enough to knock one out during lunchtime. The beef patty was juicy and the egg yolk will ooze out of the soft brioche buns. Then there was the truffle fries. Some of the best I have had. I recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. Great atmosphere and food for pre and post games outings.> Loud music, varies between quite a few styles.Food is ok.Don't order the ginger beer!! They charge you & don't take it off the bill for crappy tasting stuff. It's 96% of the ADV for sugar. 48g of sugar!!!I dislike that they didn't take the drink off the bill when I didn't like it after the first sip.I wasn't making a mule, just drinking it like a soda. Then, not refill to my soda I got afterward.Only good thing: open late for food.> So bad I don't want to waste too much time writing this review. Nothing was seasoned: burger, fried chicken, or fries. Medium rare burger was medium well. One of the employees was hostile and demeaning/cruel to a newer staff person right in front of us and other customers. Prices are exorbitant but the food wouldn't be any better even if it was cheaper.Absolutely unequivocally AVOID.> Wow- this place- best burgers of every kind !Turkey, veggie , beef- all made delicious The combination of flavor in each burger is enough to make me drive back the hour it takes to get there- I highly recommend the sweet potato fries The service is excellent- short wait time- the people are friendly and helpful. They make you feel at home. Will definitely come back again!!!> Went here tonight for the third time, tried some new things from the menu, and pleased as usual. We live in the neighborhood, and have a plethora of choices for dining out. A&B has a prime location for sunset views of the bridge from the patio, great servers (Danny is so much fun), friendly management (thanks, Austin), and some of the best wagyu beef burgers, fries, and accompaniments around. Tonight we took advantage of the summer special and enjoyed a bottle of Artemis for half-price (this made it less expensive than from the grocer) w/ our burgers. What a treat! We finished off the bottle with a brownie sundae- delicious. Great beer selection, too, if that's your thing.

The hostesses do a good job of managing the line that sometimes forms and make sure to get everyone seated quickly, single diner or large group. I'm a New Englander and always love legal. Their seafood is always great. I know it's a chain and there's plenty other seafood options (well, not in Logan but in general) but I always recommend legal. Today I went with a classic lobster roll with onion strings and coleslaw before my flight. Pricy for its small size at $35 but to be expected for lobster and Logan. I'll be back next time I fly out of Logan.> Good for a quick (not TOO quick though) bite when you're leaving from terminal A in logan. Main comment is that I didn't expect much but they surprised me. I say quick because my fastest time in and out was 16 minutes. Food is good for an airport restaurant as well, especially considering the speed at which they bring the food out. Lobster roll was surprising. Not the best I've had but it was good. They don't skimp on the meat. Not a huge fan of the crab cakes. A little mustard-y for my liking. Also not a fan of the hoisin salmon. Flavor combinations are a little weird. Too much sauce as well. The regular grilled salmon on the other hand was good. Basic flavors but liked the taste. Shrimp cocktail and oysters are alright if you're craving seafood before you leave Boston. Greek salad is quite large but good if you need some greens.> A must dine at place if streaming through Boston's Logan Airport across from A5 gate.Line moves quickly.  Kitchen is spot in cuz turnover is super quick and everything tastes delicious!Asked the hostess what she recommended and she said soicy fish and chips or crab cake combo.  I decided on her 2 nd suggestion.  Shared half with hubs plus ordered him a mug of clam chowder as he's a big boy...( in more ways then one, around the midsection I mean.)Couldn't resist the description of the BCP- what is it? I asked our server.  Good choice/ Boston Creme Pie which I also shared, 1/3 for me, 2/3 for hubs.  Light as air, just enough chocolate sauce and the crushed toffee bits, heavenlyOur server was so efficient, didn't have to ask for extra spoon or the check.  You won't regret dining here- very cool eatery.> I spent the day working in BOS and hadn't gotten a chance to get some clam chowder before I left the city. So when my coworkers informed me that there was a seafood place in Terminal A, I was thrilled!When I got a break, I went over to Legal Test Kitchen to get chowder and a salad. There was a line to dine-in as the restaurant was pretty crowded, but I'd planned to order to-go anyway. Luckily, there was a separate register for to-go orders and it wasn't long at all.I ordered my chowder and Caesar salad and the cashier recommended I get a salad from the to-go refrigerator while she poured me up some chowder from the warmer behind her. I paid about $19 for chowder, salad, and water...kinda expensive, but it's airport food, so it was expected.The lettuce in the salad was fresh, but the croutons had started to soften because the salads were pre-made and the croutons had been sitting on the lettuce. The chowder was delish and hit the spot! All it needed was salt and pepper, which I added. In the future, I'd probably just order a freshly-made salad, but overall, I was pleased.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

Yoma has the best coconut rice I've ever had, and having it with the Spice Mountain, the herby spicy flavors and the fragrant and fluffy coconut rice just makes the perfect sweet and savory and spicy combination. Yoma also has the best noodles. And I won't hesitate to order any noodle dish here honestly. I am making it a goal to try them all because they have such different takes on noodles. They have the rainbow noodles which literally mixes different types of noodles and create different textures. They always top it off with perfectly soft boiled eggs and the noodles are always cooked to perfection! I definitely recommend the Rangoon tea, take it hot with some milk in the winter and it the most heart warming drink! On a hotter day, try their traditional tea salad for a super light, and refreshing bite!> This place is a definition of a-hole-in-the-wall!I had this place bookmarked for 2 years now. And I am so glad we finally got to try it tonight! You can judge how good a Burmese restaurant is by their mohinga dish. Mohinga is a rice noodle and fish soup. Btw, mohinga is off the menu and probably the reason why it took me so long to visit this place! Their mohinga is out of this world! This is the best mohinga I've ever had, comparable to my mother in law's. Of course. Service was excellent. The owner is super sweet and attentive! Kimchi is the signature dish of korea; mohinga is the signature dish of Myanmar! You must try it!> Oh my gosh, so good! I haven't had Burmese food in a longggg time, and this was just how I remembered it. The Rangoon Iced Tea is really good, and tastes like a better Thai Tea. The limeaid is also very refreshing! Get the tea leaf salad! It's what they're known for, and the fermented tea leaves are super yummy. The crunch additions gives it a nice texture too.We also got the Coconut chicken noodles, which was perfect for a  cold day. The Spice Mountain Samosas, a baby samosa salad in broth, was my personal fave. You'd think the broth makes it soggy but it doesn't. It just adds so much more flavor!This is definitely one of my new favorites in boston!> Very friendly, attentive, service. I had so much complimentary tea :). When you check in with yelp, they give you a free milk tea. I'll save that for next time. Had their special pickled tea salad. The pickled tea has a different kind of flavor- it's good, mixed in with the salad. I liked the crunchy iceberg, tomatoes, corn, crunchy nuts and soy, and how it all came together. I think it may have had a squeeze of lime on top. Nice ambiance, with calming music, and artwork with scenes that definitely transport you to another place.> Hole in the wall Myanmar cuisine tucked in Allston and Brighton. We had the coconut curry noodle and mango salad - very hearty and delicious on a cold winter day. Service was also very thoughtful. If you check in to Yelp, you also get free milk tea !

The opening days and hours are very wonky, and the ordering experience and the physical space can be improved upon. This is not the best place to enjoy your meal, I recommend to go orders only.> This has to be one of the top roti shops in boston hands down, i love them. They would get 5 stars only if they made you roti in a timely fashion. The wait once you get there for your roti is insane and if you call it in they just move you to the head of the line once you get there instead of actually making it when you call.Great place, authentic food, amazing flavor, well worth it!Just takes a bit> Really like the roti here. If you are looking for some authentic Trinidadian roti this is the place to visit. I like the boneless chicken roti ($8.50). Very affordable and has a lot of flavor. They have other Trinidadian goodies that you can try. Everything seem reasonably priced. It gets pretty busy but service is fast. They have some seats inside but most people take their food to go.They are not open every day of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), you'll have to plan your visit around that.> Without a doubt, the best roti in Boston. I am always homesick and craving a roti, and recently heard about this place so I knew I had to try it. Although the wait was long, soca was blasting from a speaker so I had a good time waiting lol. And the wait was definitely worth it. Extremely authentic and tasty. I am ready to go back already!> Its getting a 4 because it's not open 6 or 7 days a week and the hours are weird.

I really enjoy their pork chops with peking sauce, peas pod stems with garlic, sauteed string beans, mini juicy buns with pork and roast beef with scallion pancake. Though, I would not recommend ordering take out at Dumpling Cafe because they do not double check their orders. During two separate occasions, they've packed an incorrect dish and/or forgot a dish. One incident, they gave me dumplings with mushrooms rather than soup dumplings. The second incident, they forgot an entree.> food: 7/10. good, not spectacular. price: 6/10. get a decent amount of food for a decent price. not the most affordable, but definitely a casual lunch place to go if you're in the city.service: 2/10. i'm disappointed to write a low review, but part of the restaurant experience is good customer service, and that was not provided here. maybe we caught them on a bad day, but our waitress was mean and accusative. she didn't take our order for about 20 minutes, and the joint was quite empty. the food was provided fast to make up for it. overall: 4/10. take out is probably a better option for this place!!> Ordered takeout from here one night when we were too lazy (and it was too cold) to go outside to eat. The food didn't take too long to come and the prices were reasonable, so no complaints there. One caveat here is this is of course takeout, so perhaps I might have enjoyed the food or the experience more if I had dined in. Hard to tell.We ordered the steamed beef and cabbage dumplings and the steamed seafood dumplings. The beef dumplings were juicy enough. The seafood dumplings were a bit bland, so I had to counter them with the dumpling sauce that came with it. The skin was disappointing; it was too thick and masked some of the flavor.I thought it was a mediocre meal and a quiet affair. It was what I asked for: my craving, dumplings, delivered within a reasonable time frame, without me having to pay too much for them. Three stars for a relatively safe, okay experience: did the job, but didn't blow me away.> In this new age of takeout and quarantine I wanted to start with supporting small businesses in the Chinatown area. We ordered Taiwanese dumplings, sesame chicken, shrimp fried rice and sautéed beef flat noodles. MY GOODNESS it was soooo good. The sesame chicken was so fresh and came with a side of fried rice. The dumplings were thick and pipping hot. The sautéed noodles were a great mix to our normal meal and the shrimp fried rice was okay.... the only thing that didn't blow my mind because it tasted like white rice more so then a lightly fried rice. Overall go and support because this was incredible> This is my favorite soup dumpling restaurant in Boston. Heck, it's better than some wildly craved New York soup dumpling joints.  Look at my photo! You'll see that exhilarating pouch of yummy and juicy soup dumpling waiting anxiously for you to suck on until it empties its entire content in your eager mouths. There's a few other options in Chinatown that's quite good but the soup in this one is super addictive. We also had watercress with beef in satay sauce. It was on the saltier side but still, it was mad good! Next time you see a line outside of Gourmet Dumpling House, please consider trying this place.  You might end up loving this more!","4, 2, 3, 5, 5"

I decided to come here this past Saturday for dinner with some friends and my boyfriend. We joined the Yelp Waitlist and thank goodness we did!! We waited about 30-45 minutes after we checked in and that's a given since it was a Saturday night and there was a lot going on around the area. Once we were seated we ordered quickly since we were hungry! We got two different cuts of lamb, two different cuts of beef, the tofu platter, the veggie platter, the mushroom platter, grilled sausages, lamb dumplings, half and half broth, fish fillet, and shrimp paste. The shrimp paste and fish fillet were very light and airy! The shrimp paste was very fluffy and I love getting shrimp paste anywhere that offers it. I loved the tofu platter the most because they offer this one roll that was AMAZING!! I loved it so much that I went to the store to buy some for at home hot pot. It was my first time and it was perfect. Soft and quick to cook. All of the platters are ~$15, but split is so SO worth because they give you a lot!! The variety and the amount, they are DEFINITELY NOT stingy! The beef and the lamb were super soft and tender. They cooked quickly. I honestly didn't need any sauce, but they do offer you sauce if you ask. The veggies platter was fresh and full of lots of greens! The service and the store is clean. Ambiance is your typical hot pot place. Just be mindful of the wait, the store is pretty tiny so put yourself on the Yelp waitlist to save some time. I can't wait to be back!> My boyfriend and I came on a weekend night. It was really full, so we had to stand for about 30 minutes before being seated. We got the house broth, which was much more flavorful that I had expected! We ordered the lamb shoulder, fatty beef, enoki mushrooms, quail eggs, and fish balls. Everything was very delicious! I especially loved the quail eggs and the fatty beef! The fatty beef was so tender and addicting - I wish the platter came with more!We had a wonderful time over dinner and would definitely come back again!> Food: 4Service: 5Ambience: 4Overall: 4.5Came here for the first time with my friend after seeing there was finally no wait! We got the half spicy half regular broth and ordered a bunch of meats and veggies. The food choices were average and nothing sets them apart from other hotpot places, until you try their broth!This is the only hotpot place that doesn't offer you dipping sauces and the reason being is because their broth is SOO flavorful that when you cook your food in it, it's already good enough without extra help. This was new to me because all the hotpot places I've visited there was always some kind of sauce for me to dip in. I must say the spicy broth got a bit salty towards the end of my meal, but i love sodium so it didn't bother me one bit. It was also the perfect balance of mala, so it was a very enjoyable level of spicy. I will definitely come back here for my hotpot cravings. P.S. I love that they give you a bottle of water to refill yourself. More places should do this to avoid dehydrating their customers.> Happy Lamb reminds me a lot of Xiao Fei Yang (Little Fat Sheep - which I grew up eating when I took annual trips to California to see family) in that it is one of those places where you don't need a sauce bar because the broth is SO concentrated and so flavorful already that cooking the food in just the broth is enough - and it's simple, spicy or not spicy or both?I'll admit it's pricier than other hot pot places especially when more all you can eat options are on the rise but my friend and I collectively ordered 6 people's worth of food for the 2 of us (no regrets) and we had our spicy broth refilled so many times (never lost that concentrated flavor even with the 3-4 refills) and each portion of the veggies, meat and fish balls, and tofu and noodles was SO plentiful that we were able to take home leftovers - and yes Happy Lamb let us take home our leftovers. We each got to fill a tall tupperware with that amazing broth and our excess food.And while I forked over ~$50ish bucks, the photos don't lie in how much food was consumed (people stared at us through the storefront windows ...). Plus as I have said a couple times already - that broth is SO flavorful I ate my leftovers and then was able to add a little water and my own meats, noodles, and veggies for a few more days of hot pot. I never tired of that spicy soup!Also pro tip: get the dumplings and dip it in that broth! It heats the dump up a little and jacks up that tastiness with that broth magic.> Very nice place for hot pot. Their style is a Mongolian soup style. I had  the spicy and regular bone broth. Please note that the spicy  broth really got chunks of Chili peppers chopped up and when you scoop out your meats from your broth, huge pieces of chili gets stuck in your soup strainer. The soup broth itself is amazing. Nice selection of Angus beef and lamb and homemade fish balls. Place is clean and friendly. The staff spoke English well.","5, 5, 4, 5, 4"

I think they do a good job with the packing and are pretty generous with the portions. I have always enjoyed the taste and always look forward to ordering from them again.> Grabbed a quick lunch here after a particularly grueling Barry's Bootcamp class nearby during a trip to Boston. I had always seen this fast casual restaurant around but had never tried it. I ordered a bowl with brown rice and kale, chicken, hummus, olives, veggies, and hot harissa sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and everything was super flavorful. Not only that, but the whole thing was only $10, a far cry from similar fast casual places that total up to $15 a dish. Service was quick and our server was great at explaining how the place worked and suggestions for toppings. The restaurant was clean, and because it was a weekend, fairly empty.> I remember eating here when it was Verts. So due to double session workouts on this Sunday, I ended up here at Noon for a kale bowl. My bowl had a bed of kale, grilled steak, which they cooked, fresh so I had to wait a minute for that and the spicy lamb meatball as my proteins. Then all the fresh toppings I added were feta, pickled onions, charred baba ganoush, egg plant relish and garlic sauce. My bowl was delicious! I couldn't finish and had to doggie bag. I can't wait to have this bowl again and maybe try different combos.> I work 2 doors down and today was my 3rd, and last, attempt to eat here. While the different ingredients they offer to make a bowl from are flavorful and plentiful, the chicken they serve made me lose my appetite. It was 50% chicken meat (I hope!) and 50% over-spiced fatty skin, gristle, connective tissue and veins. They chop it up small in hopes you don't notice. Gross! Never again.","5, 5, 5, 3, 2"

It's usually filled with college students, but they've added some barriers to herd everyone in line, so it's a bit better than before.The first time I came, I knew I wanted a chimichanga because those can be hard to find at other mexican ""fast food"" places. The only problem is, I have always ordered chimichangas at restaurants and I don't really know what goes in them - only that I like them. So, when I was asked what I wanted in my chimichanga, I was like ""uh... the normal chimichanga stuff?"". I was kind of scared off, so I just ordered a bowl this last time - ha! They do seem kind of rushed in there which makes it overwhelming if you don't know exactly what/how to order. I'll look up chimichanga ingredients before the next time I go.I will say that I love their spicy chicken. It was full of flavor and they gave a healthy portion. I was able to eat the bowl over 2 meals. The 1 thing I would change is the amount of guac that they put in. It's kinda skimpy.> Worst terrible place to go, rude behavior, always in rush, didn't even listen what I was asking to do, throwing food in bowl like dumping trash in garbage can. Never recommended. 2nd visit, rude staff> A small, unassuming place with some solid burritos that hit the spot on a late-wakeup-weekend. My friends were obsessed with this place and dragged me there, so my expectations were high. They melt cheese onto their tortillas before loading your burrito, and you can get a lot in there for a decent price. I got chicken with lots of toppings and a side of chips and queso. I'm picky about queso, so I wasn't super blown away by this one. The burrito was good, though! Not life-changing, but pretty delicious--no complaints from me. The staff was super friendly and the food was good and affordable--what else can I ask for on a Sunday afternoon?> Horrible place for delivery. I've ordered from here a few times and 3 times I've gotten the order wrong and looks like it was intentionally messed with. Last issue being they missed items from my order and the ones they did decide to make were slop. Mexican plate? I got a cup of rice and beans with 2 pieces of meat smothered in a pint of runny sour cream. No vegetables. Nothing else. Rice beans 2 pieces of meat and 2 cups of sour cream.  Order chips and salsa. Did not get the chips.> This spot is a fan favorite for Northeastern University students, and for good reason. They serve up quality Mexican food, from bowls to burritos, with a range of fresh and authentic ingredients (ex. plantains, veggies etc.) They're also a great option for breakfast, with their $5 breakfast burrito and coffee combo.Just beware of how much they charge you. Amelia's is notorious for over-charging patrons. I don't think they do it on purpose, it might just be a lack of coordination.","4, 1, 1, 4, 1"

My friend and I were so sad once the meal was over because we didn't want it to end!After a long day of walking around Somerville, she and I were in search of a tasty meal. With this place being around the corner from us, we were even more enticed to check it out. We made a reservation for 5:30 and it was packed! The host sat us at the bar -- it was a little cramped, but we had a great view of the kitchen and bar area.  We also had some great conversations with the bartender.We started off with several appetizers: the ceviche with mixed seafood (blue cod, shrimp, squid), and 2 special apps: the octopus with black mayo, and the yuca croqueta. If you had to pick just 1 app to start, definitely go for the mixed seafood ceviche. After we finished, we were both drooling and ready for our next meal!For our entrees, my friend got the arroz con mariscos and I got the tacu tacu. The bartender made sure my pisco sour was always filled while our entrees were being made. I cannot emphasize the view of our food being made in front of us in the open kitchen enough, it was so fun! When the food was out, we were impressed! First of all, the presentation of both dishes was very nice, especially for the arroz con mariscos. The smell that radiated from our plates was amazing too. Most importantly however, they tasted even better than they looked! I literally wanted a bottle of the sauce used for the tacu tacu because it was so flavorful and spicy (Celeste - please seriously consider bottling this sauce. I'll be first in line to buy) At this point we were full, but couldn't pass up the opportunity to try their desserts. Naturally, we got both options: the dulce de leche custard with merengue and the lucuma mousse. Both were delicious as with everything else, but I actually preferred the mousse. The mousse was light and slightly fruity -- perfect for all the delicious food we ate.This place and atmosphere is outstanding. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a phenomenal restaurant in Somerville. After having tasty food in Lima, this is the closest I can get to original Peruvian cuisine in the states.Only downside to this restaurant is that it is a bit small. However, I will make due with that so long as they can continue making this food.Keep up the awesome work and see you soon!!!> What an adorable spot! Celeste has a wonderful ambiance - I loved the music and the art on the walls. The space itself is a lot smaller than I expected, but that made the dining experience feel extra intimate. We ordered the ceviche, two different causas, and the lamb stew to share, in an attempt to depart from my usual lomo saltado. I particularly loved how flavorful and fresh the ceviche tasted! Our server was also very attentive and patient - definitely looking forward to coming back!> 3.5 stars? I wanted to like it more. It's been on my list for a while and we decided to try it for Valentines Day. I believe I made my reservation a month in advance but even then the 10:30 time was all that was left. We arrived about 20 min early and were seated right away which was awesome. The restaurant is small, so there really isn't an area to wait for a table. Service was excellent. Our server had recommendations and was attentive. I very much enjoyed their cocktails, I had both the special for the night as well as a Pisco sour. For an appetizer we had the mixed ceviche, which was delicious and flavorful. For my meal I had the scallops and squid ink pasta. Scallops were good but I found the pasta extremely heavy due to the sauce. My boyfriend had the risotto which he said was good but not amazing. Two other things worth noting... The music was too loud. It was a great mix of tunes, but depending on the song playing we could not hear each other or the server. It was also a very cold night and our table was fairly close to the door so I ended up keeping my coat on as every time someone entered or left there was a blast of chilly air. It looks like on one side of the door they put up some fabric to protect the people dining there, but I think there should be some thing protecting the entire doorway.Ultimately I am glad we went, and we had a good evening. But I don't see myself wanting to go back.> If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would! After a day in Somerville, we stopped in here for a snack and a drink. I called to make sure they were open, which they told us they had a few seats at the bar waiting for us(LOL). In excitement, we rushed over there as fast as we could to find happy and smiling staff welcoming us. It was also a bitter cold day! As we got comfy at the bar, my girlfriend who had been here before told me to try their Pisco Sour, so I did! And, OMG, it was the best cocktail I have ever had. With an egg white, and some other simple ingredients, the Pisco Sour cocktail was refreshing, soft and delicious. We also ordered a few snacks to share: the arugula salad with parmesan, fried yucca and the tuna sashimi. Everything was AMAZING to say the least! And, for dessert I had one of their popular Mezcal's on the rocks (smiling from ear to ear). Celeste is by far one of those restaurants that after eating and drinking here, you can't wait to go back again and again. My friend and I still talk about the experience to this day, and fantasize over their fried yucca and Pisco Sour. It's like a fantasy that you want to relive over and over again. After reading this review, I hope you will take my advice and go check out Celeste, you will be in Heaven!> tl dr; Reasonably priced, generous portions, come if you like seafood and/or Peruvian food!Celeste is a small restaurant in Somerville with around 20 seats. The restaurant stays true to its Peruvian roots, serving Pisco cocktails and other seafood focused dishes. It's impressive that the kitchen can have such variety despite its size. Peruvian is not something I typically have, so I was able to enjoy something new.The restaurant is quite small, so a group of four is about the largest size I would recommend. For four, we had a ceviche, causa, and three entrees and it was the perfect amount of food. The kitchen is quite generous with the portions and everything was a bit larger than what I expected from this type of restaurant. Our waiter had some excellent recommendations and was patient in explaining what the dishes were since many of us had not had Peruvian in the past.Ceviche with mixed seafood with blue cod, shrimp, squid (19): In the past when I've had ceviche from other restaurants, I've always been a bit disappointed, but this time I was thoroughly impressed. First of all, they are very generous with the amount of seafood they served. The plate was packed with seafood, which is the opposite of what I typically find. The acid in the ceviche helps tenderize the fish but not overpower it. The texture of the cod and squid were very soft, but you could still taste its natural favor. Great starter!Causa de avocado and tomato (14): The best way to describe this is a Peruvian potato salad. Potato is layered between avocado and tomato. The dish is creamy from both the potato and the avocado and a sauce over the top, and the tomato helps cut through some of the richness. Not my favorite, but not bad, I would have preferred some other textures maybe.Scallops con pasta a la huancania (27): Squid ink fettuccine and huancania, topped with seared scallops. A close tie for my favorite dish of the night. The pasta sauce is really creamy without being too thick and the scallops were perfectly cooked - seared but still tender in the middle. Tacu tacu a lo macho (27): Rice and beans with mussels, clams, shrimp & squid in panca sauce. The rice and beans combined to form something along the lines of a risotto, creamy and delicious. The shellfish was excellent as well!Carapulcra (25): Incan stew with potato, chicken, pork, peanuts, and Port wine. This is a hearty meat stew served with a side of wine. The stew itself was very flavorful and all of the meat was very tender, just a bit too salty for my taste otherwise it would have been great.Without any drinks or desserts, we ended up paying 35 per person after tip and tax. What a great value for the amount of food and high quality ingredients we had. I would love to come back and try more things!","5, 4, 3, 5, 4"

We were disappointed with the quality of the food (had the scallops and the burger, neither were mind blowing). We were unable to express our disappointment with the food, to anyone except a bus boy. We then waited another 15-20 minutes for our check, until a hostess came over and gave us our check. She did not ask us about the quality of the food.This stinks because it was one of our favorite places for drinks and it was ouR first time  having food here> Overall a fine dining experience that wasn't bad, but wasn't anything spectacular.  The cocktails were the best part of the meal (got an New England old fashion that was delicious) and if we go back, it will probably be just for drinks. Ordered a:cheese plate -  smaller than expected (4 different cheeses) but the blue cheese was quite goodbutternut squash soup -  basically just pureed butternut squash in a bowl rather than soup (think more baby food consistency than soup) Pan seared scallop with pork belly - quite good actually but the portion was surprisingly small (3 scallops and 3 chunks of pork belly) Farro and spinach salad - nothing special, literally contained the exact 4 ingredients listed on the description and nothing else. The service and atmosphere were good, but the food lacked that ""something special"" that would make us come back for more.> Wow. I am never coming back. To start off, the ambiance is pretty cool. And that's where it ends. So, we waited an hour and a half for our table. I'm not even sure why we bothered making a reservation... but oh well. We grabbed a drink and didn't mind. When my friend asked for the status, the hostess said she seated the wrong party and said she made the mistake (which resulted in our almost 2 hour wait). But anyhow, we eventually got seated and I wanted to have a conversation with the manager just to see what was going on. When the manager Lem Taipan came, he was completely rude and unprofessional. He didn't even apologize and said ""It's been busy, what could we do?"" Just PURE rudeness and completely brash in response. I explained that this was our first time and the impression was bad. He was unapologetic and did not care. This made us feel like shit. I've worked in a restaurant before as a hostess and it's really not hard to own up to mistakes and just say sorry on your behalf as manager. Wow. I don't know. Our table was speechless and the attitude of the manager killed our vibe. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant and workers were unprofessional and they honestly did not give a shit about their diners. Two thumbs down, do not recommend. Go somewhere that actually cares about their job, their customers, and their food. (being that it was fucking mediocre).> LOVED the ambiance, the service, AND the food! I got the back bay burger which was BEAUTIFUL with a perfectly buttered brioche bun. Boston has been a disappointment in the burger department and this is definitely the best I've had here by far. It was juicy, tender, and the sweet potato fries are a must! They're amazingly crispy on the outside but somehow still tender on the inside. The best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Service was quick and friendly. Will definitely be back here soon. Honestly I would come back just for the fries!","5, 1, 3, 1, 5"

The second time I came here, I tried the lamb kabob and THAT was the right move. Pictured below is the lamb kabob in all its glory - glistening, juicy, freshly made to order - what more could you want?  The cook isn't as consistent - some parts are well done, some medium, some medium rare, but pervasive through the entire dish is juiciness and flavor.  I can't wait to be back and experience the juice again> Got a delivery from Ubereats via quarantine and this is 100% going to be our middle eastern cuisine spot.

Anyways. Came in and saw the HUGE menu, which is super neat and laid out. Already knew I was the shawarma plate. Now I was a bit skeptical because it wasn't on the skewer but it smelled so good. The plate came with meat, rice pilaf and salad. The plate was HUGE. It easily could have been 2 meals, juicy meat, seasoned rice. Drunk me ate the whole thing AND ordered a baklava to go with it because YOLO. Baklava was sweet and crispy, prefect made. Definitely would come back here and the pricing wasn't bad either.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The server said ""OK cool""Would not recommend> Did an Odyssey cruise for a work function, with the full sunset experience, dinner, and DJs, and it was great. Dinner was surprisingly good, actually, and had a few vegetarian options. The DJs had the dancefloors full, like full-on wedding style energy. The cruise part was very nice, great vantage points of Boston and the harbor. Although I didn't have to pay for any part of it, I would still recommend this as a special activity to do while in Boston (or for those that live here).> Boarded the ship for a school event with dinner/dance floor/bar access. Dinner was buffet style and was decent. Great space, beautiful views- especially from the top deck.However, the bar was a scam. The liquor beverages were watered-down. After checking in with other guests, we came to the consensus that after several drinks, we were completely sober. We payed full price for the mixed drinks and were ripped off. It was offensive and shady and I will tell all who ask me about Odyssey cruises about this scam. My advice: order a beer instead and watch them pour it to ensure you won't be ripped off.> I arrived in Boston Friday night October 11 to wind and rain. My sweetheart made reservations for us for a lovely dinner cruise only to find out this beautiful yacht was going to be dockside mandated by the Coast Guard. As we checked in Chantale greeted us with a smile and welcoming attitude, informed us of the news and proceeded to make things right by giving us a future date to cruise the Odyssey again for the inconvenience. We informed her that we were from the west coast and would not be able to use a voucher in the future and is there anything she could do while we were in town. She immediately got on the phone and made special arrangements for us to cruise again on Sunday, a different yacht but made it happen regardless.

First impression is very good as the interior decor exudes a very relaxed yet upscale atmosphere. We went at around 1:30 and it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. The service was friendly but my only gripe is that it took a while for food and drinks to come out. The food itself was somewhat worth the wait. The portion size was underwhelming for my steak and eggs. The size of the steak was not worth the $17 they charge for it, and it also was still a bit bloody as it ran into my eggs. It had a great flavor though with the chive hollandaise. The roasted potatoes were good too as it soaked up some of the hollandaise sauce. My friend who got the brunch burger looked like he got the better end of selection as it looked perfectly cooked and portion-wise was very on point. The truffle fries that came with it were to die for as well. Ultimately I think I will be coming back here as a regular as I am interested in the other selections they have for brunch.> This is great after work spot! The food is good, though I mainly go here for drinks they have some great tequila drinks. What I've tried and liked so far:-Pork Belly Bao-Clam Chowder: their chowder is different, good different. -Rail Stop Burger-Baked Lasagna -Truffle Fries: I don't recommend the truffle fries... I could say it was worse truffle fries I've ever had.> Rail Stop hosted our company's annual Holiday Party this past weekend, and it was an amazing experience. Josh, the manager, was outstanding. We told him what we wanted and he made it happen.Our party was huge: 125 people were on the guest list and I was terrified of running out of food. Josh helped me come up with a plan, and he even made sure to have backup food for me and the guests in case we ran out. Even with over a hundred people taking up the bar area, it didn't ever feel crowded, nor did anyone go without food or drink. The bartenders were exceptionally friendly and speedy. The food was OUTSTANDING. We ordered the mezze platter, charcuterie, antipasto, crudite, and cheese platter, and we also had passed appetizers: veggie burgers, regular sliders, spring rolls, buffalo chicken. . . everything was perfect. I will definitely be dining here again. Thank you Josh and everyone at Rail Stop.> Had a fantastic dinner date here with my girl this Saturday night. The ambiance of the space is very nice, open and talkative, but still cozy and not too loud. The table service was friendly and efficient, but not intrusive. Had the steak frites which was delicious, and came with greens and big potatoes wedges. Girlfriend had the fried chicken sandwich which she also enjoyed. Manhattan and a rum styled manhattan to go along which were delicious.> Drinks and small plates at Rail Stop were delicious! The bees knees drink was the perfect amount of sweetness - and for someone who doesn't typically go for gin, the gin taste was not overpowering and I really enjoyed the drink. It even had an edible hibiscus flower which was juicy and delicious! The small plates were all fantastic. My favorite was the devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates), I only wish they came with a side of balsamic for dipping. Rail Stop has a good variety of options on the menu and a great ambiance inside. Lively bar area for drinks after work.","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

I wanted to get other stuff but it was so good I just kept getting the chicken cutlet sandwich. Used to go all the time when I worked over there. You even start actually feeling bad for the other sandwich shops in the area at some point...places you thought were pretty good. It's pretty simple too. I really don't know what they do. Maybe it's the braided roll or maybe it's the cutlets or the pickles or the mayo... I don't know....and the only reason I'm writing this review on a Friday night from the North shore (where I live now), and I hardly ever write reviews, is because I saw some Postmates ad on Facebook with a chicken sandwich and it reminded me of this chicken sandwich (not really but in the sense that it was good) and I'm thinking...how can I get this.> The first time I ate here, I ordered a vegetarian sandwich to go. Upon arriving at my final destination, I unwrapped the sandwich to find a chicken sandwich inside. As a vegetarian, I was disgusted and irritated that I spent my entire lunch break transporting this sandwich, only to find I couldn't eat it upon arrival. I went back and they were happy to make a new one, but it was not tasty at all. The bread was somehow hard and soggy at the same time, and the flavor was lacking.Fast forward a few months, my boyfriend and I brought our lunch (spaghetti and soup) from another establishment to eat at one of the tables here. We picked a corner table, and thought it would be okay since there was no signage telling us otherwise like the other restaurants in this building. Not to mention, another older gentleman was reading a newspaper (and not eating a sandwich) at another table adjacent to us. The owner came over and wished the newspaper gentleman a happy new year, then told us ""we don't sell that food here! These tables are for our customers!"". I apologized & offered to leave politely, since I understood it could be a policy or something, even though there were no other customers in the restaurant (besides the newspaper gentleman). We wiped the table clean, and left. Upon leaving, we saw the owner talking poorly about us to the newspaper gentleman, whom he did NOT kick out, even though he was not eating a sandwich either. Very poor representation of professionalism, and frankly, quite ageist. Had I received a bit of reciprocated politeness from the owner, such as ""hello there / good afternoon / hi, our policy is these tables are for dine-in only, I'm really sorry"" instead of an abrupt ""we don't sell that here!"" with no greeting, my review would be a higher star instead.*edited to address the owner's response below: I apologize if our actions broke your policy, but we simply did not know there was one. I feel my review is fair based on the food I received the first time around + my last experience, and I don't think bringing our parents' child-rearing methods is appropriate to address on social media. Happy New Year.> I work near Copley and this place is just around the corner. It's actually inside the French Consulate building. My company's lunch selection isn't great so I would usually go here to get a sandwich to go through yelp or other apps. I waited once in line for 30 minutes so not ideal. Some of my favorite sandwiches are the north end, New England chicken salad or the sweet Carolina Q. You can't really go wrong with anything. And picked is an added bonus. The prIce is also cheap enough so give it a try!> Working across the street, I love ordering Back Bay Sandwich on Ritual. Back Bay Sandwich allows you to get half a classic deli sandwich for $3.50 pre-tax and it comes with a pickle. Those are my go-to's when I'm not super hungry but want something fresh, not from my work cafeteria. A few months ago, my friend introduced me to the Chicken Margherita Sandwich for about $8 - I inhaled it my first few times ordering it. It was that good! It has your classic fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and olive oil drizzle - but also breaded chicken (baked, I believe) and wow, the combo is delicious! You get the tasty protein countered by the fresh ingredients. Having ordered so many times, I must say my sandwich is assembled inconsistently and tastes slightly different sometimes but all within range that I'd still call delicious and highly recommend!Most of the time, I place an order on Ritual and pick it up when it's ready because right around lunch time ~12PM, it gets p a c k e d and the line is out the door, into the hallway. Picking up is seamless, it's always ready on the counter and despite missing the in-person experience of purchasing, the man behind the counter usually takes a moment to say thank you or have a great day.> This place makes the best sandwiches in the area! I love their signature menu. If you're looking for a place to eat for lunch around the area I completely recommend this place. FYI, this place is JAM PACKED when it's lunch time.  I recommend you download the ritual app and place your order. Still expect delays though.  Sometimes the app would say the sandwich is ready but it's not... not sure if it's the app or the place but, not consistent.","5, 1, 4, 4, 4"

We both enjoy hot pot so this sparked our interest. The restaurant has a good ambiance to it. It looks very nice. We were sat at the counter. To start off I got a California roll which was very good. We both got hot pot as well. I got prime rib and she got short rib. The food was good, as hot pot usually is(can't really mess up food you make yourself). The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is obviously not the food. The service was mediocre. Our waitress started taking our order then got distracted& started taking to someone else behind us. Which I found rude. Our bill ended up coming out to $102. What also gets me is that a can of Pepsi cost $3. I have no problem with paying but that's quite expensive for a can of soda. We went on a Saturday night at about 6pm. Lucky we we're able to get seated in 45 minutes. I'd suggest to make a reservation& get a table.> Such a bizarre experience. I was pretty hyped up as shabu is one of my favorite things in the world and couple of my friends highly recommended this place. We got lamb and pork cheeks platters for two; their portion was quite tiny for the money I paid, but I did end up getting full and everything seemed super-fresh. But the reason why I downed a star or two is because of unsatisfactory service. First, we were seated in the corner by the window and waitstaffs rarely came by. It took a while for us to find out that some of the side dishes/sauce and water were missing. One time when she did come to us voluntarily, though, was to show us a picture of her friend whom my cousin ""looked very alike."" I don't think she meant any harm but it's just so cringey. That said, I'll revisit some other time just for the food and the convenience of this location but I'd love to see better customer service.> Absolutely amazing, make sure you try the sesame sauce! Servers were very nice, and the lunch combo price was great for Boston hotpot> We came here for lunch and to celebrate a special occasion. Location was easy and convenient. Right within Copley Mall Plaza and on the same floor as the Westin hotel. Manager there was great. She helped serve us and made sure our drinks were always filled whenever she came by to check on us.  We had a male server trying to take our order but a female server came in and took over. It's our first time there and she was aggressive Ain upselling us on everything on the menu, and made some confusing suggestions. We somehow got moved away from the lunch menu and had full orders of all our selections being served. The younger male server had no chance so I assume he's new. Food arrived and for the prices we paid for full orders, I was not so impressed. We got the prime rib, pork and 2 seafood platters with some teas. The broths were tasty and typical. We got the Szechuan spicy broth and the miso broth. Price came up to $200. For. Lunch.  I thought of going to Kaze for their lunch specials - they give more food than here for lunch and it's $10 - $12 per platter. Maybe it's because of location that it's so expensive but the food did not justify the cost. Many hotpot places in Chinatown would be just as a great an experience but a fraction of the cost. Probably won't be back here unless someone else pays.> Pretty good experience doing a hot pot place for the first time. We did the miso stock with meatoptions of pork cheek, A5 Wagyu, and chicken breast. The pork cheek did not impress me with this cooking style however A5 Wagyu dipped for 15-20 seconds in full boil was melt in your mouth amazing. The miso stock wasn't the best I have had however it was better than average. Very satisfying. The servers were kind and patient since we were hot pot noobs and helped us along the way through the ordering process. I would however say the prices for some items were a touch steep. That was the only downside for me. I would visit again and would likely stick to one meat for myself.","4, 2, 5, 3, 4"

This place is on our regular rotation.> Good flavors but $12.99 for chana masala and rice is too much. This is Chick Peaa no meat the size of the chana was that of a small soup to go. The chicken soup was comforting and had what appeared to be cut up tandoori chicken in it at $3.99 was reasonable.> Used to be one of my favorite places to order from (one of the rare places with paneer masala) but it definitely seems that they've changed cooks or something since the food has become incredibly spicy even when ordering mild and much less flavorful.> Second momo experience here. This time got the chicken momos. Love the 2 sauces! They have a special on the chicken momos Monday and on the vegetable momos Wednesday! Next time I come I want to do all appetizers. We got meals, and the portions were huge. I got the plantain curry (because I love plantains). It was tasty, but I thought the plantains would be sweeter- that may just be the style though. The garlic naan was nice for scooping up the sauce.> I got the chicken momo special on Mondays ($4.50). The momos were very fresh. The dough wrapping was thin but still strong enough to pick up without poking a whole through the dough. On their own, they don't have much flavor but they're pretty good once you add the spicy sauce.","4, 3, 2, 4, 4"

This place inspired me to write my first because it is such a nice place, that more people should know about. West Indian Style cooking made by the owner and his family. It is also a Market which I'll touch on.  First off the food is always great probably being made as you walk in.  If the owner is working, he ll make your dish however you'd like and more likely than not, he ll let you try a thing or two if you are unsure.

Please do yourself a favor and give this local business a  try, spread the word!> Make sure to try the yellow sauce with your jerk chicken if you go here. It tasted like a mix between spicy honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I got the small jerk chicken plate and my husband ordered the curry chicken plate. Both our plates came with fried plantains, mixed veggies, and rice and beans. The mixed veggies had broccoli, onions, and peppers. The rice tasted like brown rice and I've never tried a Caribbean place that used brown rice for their rice and beans but I thought it was pretty good. We ordered our food through Grubhub in the Yelp app and it came about 15 minutes before the earliest time they said they would be there. Awesome! I just wish there were some options of drinks on the grub hub app like some coconut water or Kola champagne. :( I also received a call about 10 minutes after placing my order from someone from the restaurant letting me know that they were running low on curry chicken. He said they would be happy to substitute the other half of meat for half of another meat. I think he could tell that I didn't know what to pick and he told me he could give me some of the turkey, jerk chicken, and the curry chicken as a mixed plate. I really appreciated that since we got to try most of their main meat options. Our two favorites ended up being the jerk chicken with the yellow sauce and the curry chicken. The curry chicken was flavorful and juicy and the jerk chicken had a mild spice to it and a really nice charred meat flavor. Also, the guy from Grubhub who dropped off our order was super friendly. I would be happy to order from here again. :)> My daughter and I are visiting from Atlanta by way of St Louis. We ordered through GrubHub $32 worth and it wasn't worth it... She had the curry chicken which was good, however, the jerk chicken seemed old & not fresh. I ordered extra sauce and both sauces were not very tasty... they tasted weird. The jerk sauce did not taste like authentic jerk sauce & the curry sauce tasted like barbecue sauce. The veggies that came with were squash onions and peppers which is not original to the islands and I was disappointed and the rice and beans tasted dry.  We were disappointed although the curry chicken was better overall it wasn't a very tasty experience.> Great quality, taste and quantity. Exceptionally good customer service. I have lived all over the Caribbean and it won't get better than this.

Foodies would call Trident a really strong restaurant that also sells books and things.As a book and things vendors, I mean, yeah, this is the core of their business: stocking everything hipster want to read, a number of level two woke titles, as well as the mass pubs ideal for parents or Secret Santa trades. Don't ignore the strong tchotchke and trinket goodies on the table running spine through the first floor - lots of quirk for gift givers.As an event space, Trident holds a number of readings and signings on the second floor, permitting a separate audience to maintain ambiance uninterrupted by casual shoppers. The layout is beneficial to introspective or emotional works that would be outright ruined if broken by a bro yelling, ""Aw dude, they got Stassi's Basic Bitch book. Harharhar.""I mean, they do have it, but still...> I am really sad that I have to write a 3-star review because I really wanted to give Trident a 5-star review. I love Trident, as a bookstore, it is super chic and totally unique. It is definitely my first stop when it comes to amazing books, memorable birthday gifts and whenever you need a unique trinket or gift. I first ate at Trident in Oct of 2017, before the fire. I absolutely LOVED the food and could not wait to go back. Then the fire happened and college got a hold of me so I, unfortunately, did not make it back until March 2020. I don't know if it was the time of day we went to eat (lunchtime) but the food was just bad. Overcooked, burnt and tasted like grease/oil with a side of food. I had an omelet and pancakes and I was expecting so much more. Trident's pancakes are rated some of the best in Boston and I was disappointed. I will be back...just not for the food.> First of all, Trident is a BOOKSTORE that sells alcohol and delicious meals. What else do you really need in life?They don't take reservations on the weekend, so expect a wait. Luckily, you can peruse the bookstore in the meantime. We went for brunch, but take note that they have events, ranging from speed dating to trivia, most weeknights. We ordered a bunch of different items. The best was the eggs Benedict. Perfectly cooked, and you could actually cut through the English muffin. On the other hand, you should AVOID the huevos rancheros. I'm really surprised because I've been impressed with everything I've eaten during multiple visits, until seeing that dish. As you can see in the picture, this is two tortillas, with very limited toppings, and an egg on top. There is a bit of salsa on the side, but it's really disappointing. Basically, definitely go to Trident and order anything except the huevos rancheros and you'll have an awesome time!> Review is strictly for the gift shop and book store. I feel complete when I walk into a bookstore and see many items geared toward the enjoyment of reading. The #blinddatewithabook wall selection is just that sort of thing and thrilled me to see it.  Great selection of greeting cards... I mean the nice ones on good card stock with creative expressions and artwork.I didn't eat here but the vibe was Hella trendy in here and the music was nice to wander around to. Customer service was ok. Respectfully Reviewed> Trident has a super cute concept that is clearly very popular, as evidenced by the bustling crowds in the bookstore and café even at 3 pm on a Monday. My group of four went to the café for a late snack/lunch and enjoyed sharing three dishes!We tried the eggs benedict, French toast stuffed with lemon ricotta, and prosciutto & brie sandwich. Our waitress was really nice and accommodated our request to cut the sandwich into four pieces, and she also offered to bring out plates so we could share. The food was good; the French toast was pleasantly plush, and the sandwich was balanced and came with satisfying ridged potato chips. When broken open, the eggs were not as runny as expected. I'm not the best judge of traditional breakfast foods as I don't eat them too often/tend to prefer to eat a lot of desserts on the less sweet side, but my friends felt that the French toast was lacking in filling and could've used whipped cream.The store is a fun place to browse with a variety of books and trinkets, although it can be difficult to access items in the narrow aisles. If even two people stop to talk, as often occurs, the entire section becomes inaccessible.Still, I would recommend Trident as a fun place to grab a bite and spend time with friends! The café has plenty of tables and seats and is a good place to have a chat, and wandering through the store is quite fun.","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

Everyone in our party enjoyed themselves and were satisfied. My only criticism was that my potatoes were not very hot and I had to ask for a coffee refill- A personal pet peeve- servers should keep my coffee cup full. This is especially true at a diner at breakfast time.> *** 11/2019 ***A seasonal specials sheet caught my eye.The Pumpkin Bisque with smoke gouda $5.99 bowl was savory tasty rich, but served lukewarm instead of hot.Both Victoria's Hangover Burger $13.99 (8 oz Angus beef patty topped with a fried egg, smoked bacon, American cheese, smother with black pepper maple syrup aioli) and Victoria's Breakfast Sandwich $10.99 (2 fried eggs, melted pepper jack cheese, famous turkey hash, topped with chipotle mayo) were served on a jumbo English muffin.  Both were pretty good.  I was just bummed that somehow I always seem to end up with the short end of the stick with my portion of french fries, which by the way, was terrific on this visit.Off the regular menu, the breakfast burrito (shaved sirloin with two scrambled eggs, peppers, onions and pepper jack cheese $10.49) was missing something.  It just wasn't particularly well flavored, and the beef came out a bit tough.  The portion sufficed though.*** 12/2019 ***New seasonal specials sheet, though there wasn't one on our table, so I borrowed the one I spotted at an empty table not too far away.Two of us ended up sharing two of the specials:Shashuka $14.99This famous breakfast dish from Israel is a delicious mix of 2 poached eggs, smothered with mozzarella and gouda cheese, in a  homemade tomato sauce spiced with onions, garlic, cilantro and paprika... Served with a side of toast and homefries or hash browns.Huevos Rancheros $14.99This famous breakfast dish from Mexico is a delicious mix of 2 eggs any style, served with avocado, black beans, cilantro, topped with salsa and shredded cheddar on a corn tortilla.Another friend later commented that traditionally, shashuka is vegetarian, the eggs are cooked in the tomato sauce, and there is no cheese in it.Victoria's may not have been traditional, but somehow the mix with the potato cubes found beneath the gooey saucy cheese with lovely bits of onion and unannounced yet welcome basil leaves was quite tasty, rich, and filling.The other dish was enjoyed by our resident vegetarian.  Visually, it was a bit deconstructed a plating, with the tortillas arriving the form of two folded tortilla shells, which we found out could be swapped out for pita upon request.  I made myself a breakfast tortilla with my shell.Of the two, I preferred the Shashuka, but if recollections serve me well, I think I may revisit Victoria's Breakfast Sandwich sooner, if it continues to remain on their special roster.*** 1/2020 ***Guess the hash browns were short lived.  They weren't offered on this visit when a bunch of ordered omelettes for lunch.The breakfast potatoes were quite good, and they filled the New Market Veggie $10.99 (minus the jalapenos please) quite well with crisp firm vegetables, which made it feel like a sensible healthy option.  A DC however wasn't crazy about the sweetened marinade used in their fried chicken.Even though the steak tips in my Victoria's Steak Sandwich on Ciabatta $11.99 came north of the requested medium rare, the meat was still quite pleasantly tender.I've been hankering lately to give their French Toast a try, and only recently realized that their Eggs & Cakes $8.99 come with either pancakes OR french toast ($5.99 a la carte for 2 pieces) with 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes or grits, and choice of toast.  Hmmm...No more Monthly Specials for now it seems.> Victoria's Diner is something of an institution. Around for decades, it's a great local diner with a large menu selection. I went with a few friends, and we all ordered from the breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs and cakes - a HUGE portion of eggs, pancakes, home fries, and toast. It was tasty, and again - huge. I couldn't finish, but not for lack of trying. My friends ordered the Southern eggs Benedict and the breakfast burger. They were both very happy.Our server was efficient and lovely. The food came out quickly, and she was always ready to refill our coffee. The prices at Victoria's are more expensive than I typically like to pay at a diner, but I expect it's due to its popularity. Get there early on weekends because it can fill up.> I've only gone here at night. From college to now. So I've have plenty of mixed experiences. Pancakes at 2am are always awesome.Burgers usually are too but this burger was dry. Tried my friend waffles fries with cheese. Those were pretty cool.> Solid breakfast, friendly staff, quick & straight forward Would come back to try more from their menu!","4, 3, 4, 4, 3"

Amazing location with some outside seating (but just take it to go and sit by the water!), unbelievable staff and great food/beverages.The fresh-squeezed OJ is a bit pricey, but it's worth it. Great & fresh sandwiches, wonderful selection of varied breakfast platters, awesome smoothies and some decent baked items as well.The staff are incredibly fast, organized, efficient, friendly and they make great breakfast! I wish I could have breakfast and lunch here every day, but for now I'll settle for the occasional weekend visit.> While staying in Boston, I found Style Cafe because of it's close proximity to my hotel.  They had a lengthly menu with breakfast and lunch options to interest everyone.  I ordered the turkey, brie, tomato and basil on brioche which hit the spot!  My boyfriend ordered the Colombian breakfast and was so happy with his choice.  I also ordered the lentil soup to-go which was homemade, and tasted just like moms!  The cranberry bread was moist, and perfectly baked!  And their tea selection was great!  Organic teas, with several options to choose from.  I wish their was a style cafe close by to home, I would make it my go-to morning spot!> Yum!!! I can only say great things (or ""tings"") about Style cafe. Food was fresh, delicious and really reasonably priced. I'd definitely go back.> Five times is not a charm at style Café. While staying with my friend for a few months at Flagship Wharf, I decided to frequent style café out of convenience and their menu was fine. But every time I went there -- there was an issue of some sort of another. This last time I ordered a meatball sandwich got it all the way up to our apartment on the 7th floor -- only to find it had been made and served to us on moldy bread. There is no way that whoever made that sandwich did not realize that was moldy bread. There's just no way.A time or two before I remember I ordered a sandwich and a Diet Coke. As I sat staring at the cashier for 15 or 20 minutes I finally said to her ""is my sandwich almost ready?""  She replied ""oh I didn't know you ordered a sandwich.""Really? You think I'm just standing here staring at you for 15 minutes -- oy.I'm serious if you look at my profile I've never left a negative review, but after six months of nonsense they really need to get their act together. The Navy Yard deserves better.> In Boston from North Carolina on a sight seeing trip. Chose style cafe for breakfast since we were heading to Charlestown to see the shipyard. If you are looking for a ""to-go"" sandwich it is an ok place. If you are hoping to sit down and enjoy a plate with service choose somewhere else.","4, 5, 5, 1, 2"

The staff and the atmosphere made it the perfect place for a celebration. A member of our group has celiac and were accommodated with several dining options.We selected the calamari and Bibb salad for starts - both were delicious.The Veal chop, gf gnocchi with bolognese as well as the haddock were tasty and satisfying. The wine pairings were perfect. We will return.> We had a great first visit here the other night.  Lets start with the vibe and setting.  The tables are well-spaced and the ambiance is really nice for a quiet dinner.  It would be great for a group too but on a Tuesday, it was relatively quiet which is what we were looking for.The service was excellent with good advice and attention to details.  We had the tuna tartare and the scallop crudo to start.  The tartare is HUGE and definitely shareable.  It was really nice tuna with just a few crisps to add some texture.  The scallop crudo was bigger than your typical crudo and had a really nice blend of textures and flavors.For mains, we had the scallops and halibut which were both excellent.  The halibut had just a schmear of butternut squash and a nice, but modest, portion of brussel sprouts.  If you order this expecting much more than the fish, you should get a side.  We didnt need to do that and with a starter, were definitely full by the end.The cocktail list is EXCELLENT and the Cinghiale was a nice twist on a manhattan with the smoke of scotch instead of bourbon.  The wine menus is extensive and the choices by the glass are great.  We went albarino and rosso di montalcino which were both terrific.We couldnt stay for dessert but there were definitely interesting choices and a great bourbon list (and other things too) with probably 40-50 to choose from just for the bourbons.We really enjoyed our dinner which had to be quick and will be back!> I had the fish stew with lobster, tuna, shrimp, squids, clams, mussels.  Perfect soup base - flavorful without being salty, allowing the fresh seafood natural flavors to come through.  There was a piece of toasted bread with some cream sauce I didn't care for.  Just plain garlic butter bread would have been better.  The service was excellent especially I was dining alone (often neglected).  The older waiter was super sweet.  Highly recommend this dining experience!> We LOVE Prezza. It is by far one of the best Italian restaurant in Boston's North End. We love the shrimp and flower zucchini appetizers, and all of the home made pasta entrees and deserts. Service is always impeccable, and their wine selection is top tier. Prezza never disappoints and you're guaranteed to have an amazing experience and a very special meal. Valet lot across from Prezza is usually $20-$25 - parking is difficult around there. Bring cash. Highly recommend Prezza!> This is the second time visiting Prezza - and for a bachelorette dinner. The bride to be is very close with the staff and the dinner was unique and delicious. Soup to start - seasonal and fresh fall ingredients. Next a few apps! Arancini, Caprese salad, olives, prosciutto. As an entree the gnocchi and of course for dessert a selection of tiramisu, cannoli, cookies, and other delights! The staff is attentive, knowledgeable and they make sure your entire experience is the best. Love Prezza!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

First off, big shoutout to our waiter who I thought did an excellent job service wise and was also really personable. The experience actually highlighted even more how disappointing the service we'd had at No. 9 Park the night before was. We started with the clams Orfano as well as the Nonna's garlic bread (which I forgot to take a picture of) paired with Parmesan mousse. While the clams were good, I think there was just too much breadcrumbs on top which while providing necessary textural contrast seemed overwhelming and too dry. Parmesan mousse was interesting different but might have liked the warm hand-pulled mozzarella instead which was the other starter we were considering. The bf got the maltagliati for his pasta course which was good. I was also tempted by the other pastas but suspected I didn't have the space for it plus I was gonna get the pizza lasagne as my main. Our waiter brought over the largest pepper mill ever (must have been like at least 3 ft!) which made me exclaim in surprise haha. The pizza lasagne was good and had that crispy cheese that's part of lasagna's appeal. My friend got the monkfish piccata and raved about the sauce. The bf got the pig parmesan. For dessert, we split the ricotta cheesecake pie. Overall, a good meal!> It was really good but the portion sizes are so small for the price. At least the high end Italian restaurants in the north end give good portions. I got gnocchi and there were 7 for $20 But other than that it's really good and absolutely adorable on the inside! If you're balling and aren't  very hungry then no worries!> It's... fine. But as fans of Tiffani Faison's food and restaurants, we expected to be blown away- and weren't. My dining group all agreed: Orfano comes in a distant third to this group's other 2 excellent restaurants (Tiger Mama and Sweet Cheeks), and can't really compete with other local Italian spots we like. Every dish we tried was fine- reasonably tasty, cooked appropriately, not bad in any real way. But none of it was as delicious as what I've had at Tiger Mama (OMG that cha ca la vong), Sweet Cheeks (biscuitsssss and farm saladdddd, drool), or Fox & the Knife (that pasta, and chickpeas, and amaro cart tho).The garlic bread was fine- but was on the drier side and could have been amped up with more butter/garlic/cheese/flavor. The Orfano clams were fine- but were missing something (probably more butter and pancetta, both for more flavor and to make it less dry and crumbly). The fusili alla vodka was fine- tasty sauce, but the pasta was standard and there was not enough of it (definitely not an entree portion IMO, more like an app portion but for $24). My pig parm was fine- nicely crispy with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, but the dark meat was a bit on the tough side (whereas I like a tender tonkatsu) and didn't have enough moz/cheese/flavor. My dining companion's swordfish was fine- cooked nicely, good flavors, but nothing special. The chocolate cake was fine- nicely presented, good flavor, but not enough crunchy bits for textural contrast and nothing that stood out (just a solid chocolate cake). Basically, everything we ate was missing something to take it from technically OK to really good.To their credit, service was excellent, the atmosphere is classy and cool (think they describe it as an old-school steakhouse but for females?), and the cocktails are inventive yet classic and delicious. It's a place I wouldn't mind coming back to if someone wanted to go, by any means- but is not a place I'd suggest myself because I think the other places I mentioned are better and thus more worth your $. I will continue to be a fan of this chef and restaurant group though- you'll just need to find me at their other 3 spots instead of this one.> You know when it comes to a Tiffani Faison restaurant; the aesthetics, ambience, food, and service is going to be on point. Orfano definitely checked off some of those boxes. To start, service was excellent and our server Charlie was really great.For appetizers: we got mozzarella, prosciutto (?), garlic bread, meatballs, calamari, and the caesar salad. Out of that list, I would HIGHLY recommend the meatballs. The meatballs themselves were super flavorful and the sauce it comes with was good enough to drink! And I would slightly recommend the calamari but, too much onions and not enough actual calamari. The garlic bread was kinda stale and everything else was meh.For pastas: lobster bucatini, cacio e pepe, bolognese, and their summer pasta (forgot the name). The lobster bucatini was incredible, my favorite dish of the entire night. The bolognese was a little on the basic side albeit still really tasty and done right. My group really enjoyed the cacio e pepe, I wasn't a fan and thought it was bland and dry. Skip the Summer pasta, it tasted like a garden with black pepper.For entrees: veal chop, chicken, and monkfish. My group all agreed the veal chop was the weakest dish of the night. Bland and not enough sauce was the general consensus. The chicken was very delicious, tender, and cooked perfect. The monkfish dish was also good, the fish itself was kinda bland but the sauce somewhat made up for it.So in summary, get the: meatballs, calamari, lobster bucatini, bolognese, chicken, and monkfish.> Came here the night of the Billy Joel concert, and this place exceeded all expectations! I have watched Top Chef religiously since Season 1 and have been a Tiffani Faison fan ever since. I hoped since Orfano recently opened that she would be there, and she was! Such a thrill to finally meet her! She was so gracious and patiently posed for photos with me. She said Billy Joel ate there the previous evening!The restaurant itself is aesthetically beautiful- as others have noted the Lady Gaga portrait and fun signs by the bathrooms are so cool. I was really looking forward to trying the martini cart, but apparently so was everyone else because we were never able to flag it down. It looks awesome though! And we had an amazing Italian red wine. The food was absolutely delicious- I only wish I could have eaten more! Everything was so fresh - the tomato salad was incredible, and my cacio e Pepe was perfectly al dente with wonderful peppery and cheesy bursts. Everyone was happy with their fresh pastas. Next time I'm back in Boston my first stop is going to be Orfano. And I'm going to order the Pizza Lasagne, because I am obsessed with pizza! I'm kicking myself for not ordering two entrees.We had to rush off to the concert, but I hope to have time for dessert on my next visit. Thank you, Orfano, for a perfect last meal in Boston! Cheers!

Decent decoration as well- Food: really tasty, I didn't leave an ounce of that broth behind - Price: this is the only issue in my opinion. Yes, it's East Cambridge, but paying $25 for one ramen bowl (after tax and tips) feels excessive.> First of all, ramen at the back bar is my go to. Hand crafted drinks along with delicious hot bowl of ramen. Yum! Hugo the head bartender will tell you all about drinks specials and food pairing. He will never let you down. I love their hot pot too. They often have specials for like new broth and appetizers. My favorite app is the spicy shishitto pepper. My favorite broth is the goji berry and mala split pot. Delicious Definitely recommend to peeps who love ramen or hot pot or both .> Finally had time to check this place out!! Came with my boyfriend for lunch, the hostess offer to bring us to the lounge area but my boyfriend decided to try their hot pot. He had the prime rib combo with the Chinese spicy broth and I had the ""bromance"", interesting name for a ramen lol. The meat looked fresh and the charshu for my ramen was WOW, I mean, WOW. Lol. Service was prompt and nice, our server and the manager made sure we had everything we need. If I had to complain, it's a little pricey but I guess you pay for what you get.. Will def come back for dinner!!> If you like DIY foods (think Korean BBQ), try shabu shabu! Your waiter will teach you everything you need to know, but basically you pick a broth, proteins and noodles and the waiter sets up your table. The broth gets heated and, once boiling, you can quickly cook your own meats, veggies and noodles right at the table. It really doesn't take long to cook the food yourself and it's fun to mix and match broths and sauces with the various meats and veggies. Be adventurous and give it try! This place was delicious, well laid out for parties of all sizes and the staff were amazingly helpful (helped us figure out what to order, how to cook, brought us water before we asked, and checked in on our progress regularly despite the restaurant being packed).> Came here for the ramen. First off they have a pretty solid menu with lots of options. I like spicy so I went with the Hells Ramen and yes it was very very spicy. Like acidic spicy the way I prefer (haha).Great vibe and lots of space. In Kendall so easy to come to during work days and for team outings.will try the other options on menu in future.

A lot of people were also waiting in the lobby - the restaurant is quite big on the inside, it looks really nice. Upon sitting down, we were greeted by our server, and bread was brought over. I wasn't a fan of the unsalted butter and sesame on the bread, but bread is bread. Before coming to the restaurant, I already knew which items I was going to choose from.I did go with the restaurant week options, however my boyfriend and I both upgraded our entrees for an extra $25 to the 45 day dry aged prime ribeye because filet mignons are too lean. We ordered the lobster bisque along with chocolate mousse and cheesecake for dessert. We also ordered Duck Confit Meatballs - they were AMAZING, literally wiped all the sauce off the plate. Definitely worth it. The flavor and sear on the steaks were good - they actually had us cut into the steaks when they brought it out to make sure it was how we liked them. The lighting is not that great, so my boyfriend did not realized that his steak was a bit undercooked. We had both ordered medium rare cooks. It was fine to eat though, and it worked out for our leftovers when we reheated it on the stove it was still soft since it wasn't overdone. The mashed potatoes were just plain mashed potatoes, I wish we got more of it though.  Our dinner was almost two hours long before desserts, so the service is quite slow. If you're not looking to dine for a really long time, make sure to ask for your food to come out quicker. We had somewhere to go that night so I had to ask for my dessert to-go. The cheesecake was REALLY good, it was light and fluffy unlike other really dense cheesecakes. Recommended for date night but only if you're paying restaurant week prices. With the upgrade, each of our 3-course meal went from $38 to $63, which is less expensive compared to ordering the 45 day dry aged steak as an entree ($68).> I was only there for the Restaurant week menu last week. Walk in without much expectations since the past few restaurant week experience from other high end steak house did not wow me (but again, 38 dollars without tax & tips, I wouldn't expect too much). Started with the lobster bisque then The 8oz filet mignon and wrap with with the cheesecake. The lobster bisque was pretty good. It's not extra creamy like some do the ones that you got filled up after one small bowl. A few lobster meat which is fair. The taste was more real than artificial flavor. As an appetizer, I think it was a good start. The 8oz filet mignon was pretty good. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked as medium rare which I was very happy about. It came with a side of meshed potatoes and we also ordered a size of Brussels sprouts to share. We both think the Brussels sprouts was a bit too lemon juiced so the taste was overly sour. Last was the check cake. The restaurant week menu's dessert options was cheesecake or chocolate mousse. My boyfriend & I each order which. I liked the cheesecake a lot! ( prob my favourite part of the whole dinner) The base is made with cracker and nuts. The body of the cheesecake are very fluffy & light (very different from what you will get from Cheesecake Factory but don't get me wrong I love cheesecake factory's cheesecake! But those are very dense which I will not be able to finish the whole slice). The chocolate mousse was ok. If you are the kind who has a very strain sweet tooth then you might like the chocolate mousse over the cheesecake cause after I had a taste of the chocolate mousse I can't taste anything from the cheesecake and did need a sip of water to wash it out. Overall I think I would give it a 4 mostly b/c of the dessert and the service you get. But the entree was average. Prob would not go back if it is not restaurant week or might only gonna go back for just the cheesecake!> Randomly walked into this place.  We were offered immediate seating in a booth by the bar. The seating was great, very comfortable, perfect for people watching and two managers were walking to each table to check in.1. As you sit, you are offered Soft and warm sesame bread with butter on the side.Here's a list of what we ordered:-Shellfish plateau for 2 came with 3 pieces of shrimp, mango lobster chilled salad (no bueno, it was too sweet), 2 oysters, and lobster....as you could see it didn't come with crab claws.- Lobster Mac and cheese always on point and very cheesy.- For such a classy and expensive restaurant I would expect staff to cut and label my steak at table side.  Steak was soft, although I ordered medium well, was more on the well side. All the juice was by the bone and so was all the pepper...- the lamb was cut prior to being brought to the table and cooked medium well to perfection. - I was more impress by the huge bar, ambiance, wine rooms than the steak it self.> Went for restraunt week. My filet was burnt on the edges, dry inside, and just not impressive. Lobster bisque was ok. a little salty, not much flavor but small pieces of succulent lobster so thats a positive. Favorite thing was the strawberry cheesecake. Would pass on coming here again but the interior design was nice. Lovely velvet booths.> Worst service and lack of respect we have ever experienced. We got there 5 min before our reservation on a Wednesday night. There were two couples waiting to talk to the host and they got seated. The hostess was very dry, didn't ask anything so I said our names. She told us we would be seated in two minutes. While we waited we noticed that there were people seating at the bar but the restaurant was pretty empty. 20 minutes later, the hostess still haven't called us or talked to us at all. We decided to leave, politely told her and she just rolled her eyes and did say a word. No apologies for the delay, no offer for a glass of water, didn't say anything. Not sure what's the deal with them but it's certainly not getting my $$!","4, 4, 3, 2, 1"

I don't know how they did it...but the creators of the Impossible Burger and the Chefs here who put the toppings together went Balls to the Wahl!!! We stumbled on this burger by complete accident. And by 'we' I mean my dining companion, who's identity will continue to be shrouded in mystery, discovered this meatless wonder by failing to read the menu. Totally out of character for this carnivore...I asked several times if this is what they wanted and I was assured it was. I even asked that they read it back to me, which they did. And this is why I won't identify the person...after going over this 5 or so times, they still completely missed the PLANT PROTEIN mention *reading FAIL* I was low-key kind of happy cause I've always wanted to try this Impossible Burger, but not at my own expense, so I let them order w/ out saying a word...yeah I know, hell is HOT. I played it safe and stuck w/ the 'Our Burger' w/ Government Cheese, LMAO. I'll get it out of the way before getting to the good stuff and say yeah, this burger was good but very basic...I played it too safe. What I wanted to see was the reaction from the Impossible Burger. Was the jig going to be up on the first bite??? Was it going to really look and taste like a hamburger or some mystery grainy cornmeal patty??? The answer was yes and no. The jig was not up, the patty looked AND tasted like real meat!!! Even though I wasn't the one to order the faux meat, it didn't stop me from attempting to commandeer it. This burger has inspired me to purchase the patties semi regularly at places like Whole Foods. Service was not as good as the burgers and was served w/ somewhat of an attitude at times. All things considered, I'd highly recommend this burger joint and am salivating at just the thought of returning.> Had to come and try the spot! Honestly would of gotten a higher raTing but my CC information was jacked from here. So be warned and keep an eye out on your CC statement. Besides that incident the food it's self was good not greats. Don't bother ordering the Mac and cheese you can make better home from a box. The burgers were delicious, they add their flare to it which makes it nice.They do have a bar and quick service window compared to a sit dOwn area.> This place is a disaster. We stopped by at 1:30 on MLK day and ordered takeout -  2 burgers, tots and onion rings to go. The place wasn't busy but we still had to wait over 25 minutes for the place to mess up our order. Our order wasn't prepared to go even though we clarified with the staff twice that we wanted it to go. Also, why ask how you want our burgers cooked? Our burgers were so overcooked they were crunchy. Overall a terrible experience and huge waste of time. This place needs much better management and is definitely not worth it.> I've been here a couple times. Some days it's packed and others not so much but I haven't had to wait very long on my order. The portions have gotten smaller for some of the sides. The onions rings used to come in a basket like what the burgers were served in. The taters tots are about the same.I've ordered the super melt, which is really good minus how crusty the bread gets because it cuts the top of my mouth. Since that I've been getting it on a brioche bun.The Our Burger is the burger I order the most when I dine in.My favourite part of wahlburgers are the selections of the sides. Good Onion rings are hard to come by and I like how they do it. They have tater tots - regular and sweet potato. Also their pickles are really good.> Pros: The food was decent.  The atmosphere was fun if you like Markl Wahlberg.  Which I do. Cons: 1. Portions are small, 2. Drinks are small,3. The wait time is ridicules for a burger joint knowing that the place wasn't crowded. We waited for over 40 minutes for a couple of sandwiches 4. The service is bad, we had to wait for about 15 minutes before the server brought the menus, and another 10 minutes after that to take the orders, and about 40 minutes for the food to be served, and then 20 minutes to bring the check knowing that we asked for it several times, and the other waiter said that our server went out and she can't be found!  When they did bring our food, they messed up two of our 4 orders.","4, 2, 2, 4, 2"

Growlers ranging from Bud Lite to Guinness to local craft IPAs are $14 for a growler with no charge for the growler. I looked at the bottled wine list, and the prices are reasonable. Their family style menu is quite reasonable. I ordered takeout for Easter , and received a nice $5 gift card.Not sure when these awesome deals will expire, but this could be the silver lining in an otherwise awe full pandemic.> The Yard House is always good for a decent meal and cold beer. The onion rings are practically vegan with ""possible"" milk contamination which us likely in any kitchen. But they are oh so tasty. The music and sports shown just really make the meal more enjoyable! Love the many vegan options!Ok so we returned a few days later. Ordered a beyond sausage. Was told they would provide more sausage if one wasn't enough. At no additional cost.  Manager came out to talk to us to make sure all was well. This place is the best!!!!> Came here at 11:30 pm on Super Bowl Sunday. The place was nearly empty except for a small handful of tables, which was interesting to see since the restaurant is so large.My friend asked for a beer and the pint they served him was completely flat. Not a fun time...I guess they were running out of drink ingredients because people probably ordered a lot during the game. I tried asking for their new cocktail and they couldn't make it.I always feel a little weird reviewing chains... What I can say is this place is great for large parties and they have a huge drink selection. They have this tablet on each table that allows you to split the bill for each person, which is again great for large parties. The service is usually decent but not spectacular. The happy hour specials are a good deal. Sadly, they close at 12:30am so if you like late nights then I suggest visiting literally any other bar in Fenway which is guaranteed to be open later.> My friends and I came on a weekday evening for dinner. It wasn't crowded, so we were seated quickly. We ordered chicken nachos, angry orchard ciders, and a Margherita pizza to share. The chicken nachos were so delicious and the perfect size for three people to share! The ciders were delicious, as I expected. The Margherita pizza was pretty awful. It was very bland and tasted as if it were frozen pizza from a supermarket. The service was quick and efficient. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. Despite the pizza, everything tasted wonderful and we  had a good time! We'd come back for the nachos and cider!> Went here before a Red Sox game and the place was packed! They told us it would be a 25-35 minute wait when we arrived. After waiting quite a while, I checked in on our placement and the hostess said we had been waiting 40 minutes and we should be seated in another 10-20. I reminded her she had told us 25-35 initially and she said that they have a call ahead system that bumps those people up in like. This would have been very convenient to know about when we picked this restaurant! Make sure to call ahead on a game day! The food was, however, very good. The poke nachos were exceptional and on their 1/2 price happy hour menu! My husband and I split the steak and potatoes and other members got the salmon two different ways. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and ran off to put in our 1/2 price app order before 6 pm hit on their computers hit 6 pm","5, 4, 4, 3, 3"

Not only did they surprise the table with a bottle of champagne as it was our friend Elaine's birthday, they went way above and beyond in every aspect to make sure we were taken care of (putting the remainder of the birthday cake away during the game for safe keeping!) We started with the oysters and some sushi (mango tuna, another type of tuna roll that was incredibly fresh and an avocado ball) before moving on to the steak salad, bolognese, salmon and my boyfriend had a burger. The fries were absolutely delicious too!I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly!> Great pre-game fun.  Limited menu, but the food was good. Oysters were fresh and yummy.  Crab cakes, usually disappointing, were excellent.    Terrific and enthusiastice service, as well.  The place was almost empty and one of the servers showed us all around the upper level. Also, we had a view including the Bunker Hill monument, the masts of the Constitution, and the whole North End - beautiful.> Slam-dunk!If you go to see the Celtics or Bruins at the TD Garden and happen to get onto the Premium Club level, then consider saving some time and just have a great dinner inside the Garden.While the menu was limited, the dishes looked and tasted great. I opted for the short rib. It was unexpectedly covered in a glaze that had some blueberries in it. It was both sweet and tangy - blueberries?! I can tell you it was great. The short rib was set on some mashed potatoes that were great with the glaze.Think of Banners Harbor View as a swanky restaurant lodged in one of the best sports venues in New England. If you have the opportunity to try it, it's a great pre-game activity that won't disappoint!","5, 4, 4, 3.5, 3"

One of the best place in Cambridge! Even though the food seems simple, but they have delicate flavors. Also they constantly add more seasonal options, which is great. The host is very knowledgeable about their wine selections. Good pair with the food> Beautiful and clean, prompt (but not overly chatty or friendly) service. Pretty empty on a weekday morning when I went in. Every single thing here is overpriced. I got the avocado toast, and, while flavorful and delicious was tiny (one small slice from a boule if you can imagine it) for the price and also on the saltier side. You're going to get a bigger serving literally anywhere. I also got the Hong Kong milk tea. I asked if it ""comes sweet"" and they said ""we can make it without sugar."" I said ""oh no I do want sugar"" but the milk tea that came out was also small, mildly sweet at best, kind of watery but also had a giant layer of foam on top. The place is small and while they bring your food out to you, they seem adamant about having customers pick up drinks. (There were 4 people working and only 4 patrons, so it wouldn't have been hard to walk drinks out to people?!) There are now way more options in the Kendall area than there used to be, and while it was an okay breakfast, I'd try somewhere else next time!> I continue to come here because it's so close to work. Today I came with 2 other friends to enjoy their happy hour, which is a glass of wine or beer with a free plate of mozzarella sticks. I got a glass of white (well I asked for red but I guess she didn't hear me?) and it came with two small mozzarella sticks. Each about the size of a finger, for a small hand. Overall still a good price for the area at about $9.50 per glass (with free app). Around 4:30pm it's not too busy, but started to get more busy around 5 or 5:15pm. There's a more extensive app list (including charcuterie board, nachos...) but none of that is up for grabs because the glass of wine comes with mozzarella sticks. And... so all 3 of us god mozzarella sticks. Even though a couple of us tried to 'trade in' for something that was equal or lesser value in apps, so we could at least try something else besides mozzarella sticks. The sticks were ok and nothing special. I heard they just started doing this special and I'm hoping they will expand to allow other 'free' app rotations so that a group of multiple people can experience an assortment, instead of... all the same dish :( Overall good experience, nice ambiance in the late afternoon after they cover up the glass windows with black drapes.> Big fan of this place! Everything is tasty and fresh.  My favorites are the breakfast sandwiches, but the salads and smoked salmon items are also delicious.  Very hip and trendy in both their atmosphere and menu selections> I came here before my doctor's appointment with hopes to have a quick bite and a delicious coffee. I ordered a cortado with oat milk and a kale salad (that comes with bacon). The salad was good- although I will say it was very basic which was surprising for this cafe. The cortado was delicious. I enjoyed the coffee quality a lot. I thought the cafe presentation was beautiful and the fancy idea to pour out glasses of waters for customers was thoughtful. The service was pleasant and friendly. I also did enjoy the interesting biotech conversations I was overheating near me. Since this cafe is right in the biotech center of Cambridge, this cafe is probably a regular hangout for workers and makes for a decent people watching spot haha I would come back here for a quick coffee and potential pastry if I was in the neighborhood.

Tried this place thanks to Caviar. Currently my sister's go-to delivery place specifically for Asian food. Meats are very flavorful, and don't require all the sauce that comes with it. I'd recommend getting sauces on the side. ALSO, highly, highly recommend the cheesy kimchi fried rice ball. Basically an Asian version of arancinis. Total comfort food. Perfect for a night spent in while social distancing.> This place hits the spot when you just want some good Korean fusion. It's not the best I've had (I'm spoiled, SF has the best), but it's decent. We all shared an OliToki Burrito with Bulgogi, Totchos with soy garlic chicken, and the classic wings with OliToki sauce. The burrito was bomb; it's got your meat, nice kimchi flavor, their sauce, yummm. The Totchos were also good, and they didn't skimp on the chicken. Personally, I thought the wings were the weakest part of the meal. They just didn't have that crunchy glaze reminiscent of Korean Fried Chicken, y'know?Price wise, its a little up there for what you get in my opinion. Like, you could definitely finish that $12 burrito in one sitting. So no leftovers for the next day. But the price wouldn't hinder me from ever coming back. Especially, since the Kimchi Fried Balls sounded good.> I read about OliToki online and was interested in trying it, but my fiancé has the taste palate of a 6 year old... so I was a little nervous. We both left full and unbelievably satisfied. They have something for everyone, no matter what they're looking for. I highly recommend this little treasure> Preface, I LOVE most Korean fusion, so I am biased.But this place is absolutely great - definitely try the totchos with your favourite type of protein. Crispy tater tots drowned in sauces, cheese, kimchi... What's more to want?!Seating is limited, however. They are usually pretty fast at takeout.> I was pretty excited about the possibility of getting some cheesy tofu quesadillas (or in this case, kimchi-dillas) and I adore everything kimchi, but this place didn't live up to the hype, sadly. My boyfriend and I were the only people in there, and still ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes for our takeout, which seemed pretty over the top to us. Our kimchi-dillas were very light on the cheese and dry, and even though I ordered mine extra spicy it was still super bland. Luckily the side aioli was good and helped give the quesadillas some flavor. That being said, the kimchi dumplings were good, and the food was served hot. There were other things on the menu that sounded interesting, and I'd be willing to try them if in the area, but I think I'll just be making my kimchi-dillas at home from now on.","4, 4, 5, 5, 3"

It's not necessarily... my thing? But it was good food. Filling but not unhealthy. Not bad honestly.> Heard a lot of hype about Bon Me, so I had to try! I got their Food Truck Fave and their Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The Food Truck Fave was a pretty large portion and had pulled pork. The pulled pork was really well seasoned and extremely tender. The sauce was also very good and complimented and brought together the entire meal. However, skip the Viet iced coffee - doesn't taste anything close to a real Viet iced coffee, it's more like a sad iced mocha.> They hopped on the Ritual bus! Use this app to order ahead and like Level Up, get rewards and discounts. My very first order with Bon Me through Ritual had a $2.55 discount. I also realized that they switched up their menu a bit. Gone is the Five Spiced chicken which was my go to protein of choice. I did however try their newer item this time, Gochujang chicken which is a spicy Korean chili paste. Paired with the sesame dressing over soba noodles and it was a treat! Great addition to the menu.> The food is good when you can get it, but if you have dietary restrictions, it's really not worth going to the trucks anymore. I'm vegan, and the truck in my neighborhood tends to run out of tofu early on in the lunch period. I understand that this happens sometimes, but in the past, it was much less frequent and they were much nicer about it. They would a) cross it off the menu on the side of the truck and b) offer to let you substitute in any of the vegan add-ons at no charge. At some point this changed, and nowadays you get to wait in line to find out that they don't actually have what's on the menu and that you're going to pay full price for a bowl with some rice and lettuce and a gaping hole in the middle that prompts the people preparing your food to ask if you're absolutely sure you don't want any protein.I tried submitting feedback suggesting that they bring back their friendlier policies on this, but they never responded to it, which I suppose is consistent with the new policies...  It's disappointing that their attitude has changed so much. I used to love the food and look forward to visiting the truck every week.","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

I have had tacos from Los Angeles and Mexico, so you cannot expect me to say these tacos are on the same level. Affordable, yes. Authentic, no. Customer service, none! The lady who took my order was rude actually. I asked what seems to be popular here and she rolled her eyes before answering me. Lady, if I knew, I wouldn't have asked you... mind you, this was my first time coming here and every place is different. You order your food at the counter and pay. Then when your food is ready, you go back to the counter to literally get your own food to bring your table if you're dining in. It is similar to ordering at Chipotle, which I do like for a fast food place but that is a different yelp post. Overall, this place is okay.> A M A Z I N G.This place looks like nothing special from the outside, yet let me say that the food will blow your taste buds away. Great burritos and guac.If you are looking for a fancy Mexican place with tequila opt out of this little joint.HOWEVER if you are looking for amazingly fresh authentic Mexican for an affordable price stop in here. No waiter service, you order at the counter and you are on your way.> The almost perfect 5 star rating that Tenoch has really speaks for itself. The tacos are amazing and the service is always great as well. Tenoch has managed to make a name for itself as a Mexican restaurant in the North End - that's not easy to do! Plenty of others have tried, and failed. This is the go-to Mexican spot in the North End and that's not changing anytime soon. 5/5 I recommend this place to everyone.> Great tacos in north end.

Would never have known if it weren't for the deal buy one get one pizza. Have come by a couple times time and must say Vodka Classic and Vanessa's Pesto are my personal favorites as they're the ones I feel you can't find anywhere else.Vodka classic seems to be an elevated margherita but just surpasses it. It is made with vodka sauce and then topped off with fresh basil, prosciutto, and cheese. Really great option if you're looking to step away from just a traditional margherita and looking for that little extra something. A bit more though I'd say I prefer the Vanessa's Pesto. Though I usually prefer a traditional red sauce on pizza this one is a major mind changer with the pesto! The pesto base is then layered with cheese, grilled chicken, and caramelized onions. Only thing I will say is that the first time the ratio of ingredients was just perfect, second time however they went a bit heavy on the onions (easily picked off though). In any case, great flavors, many many options making it the perfect pizza for a night in.> Came in on a Sunday nigHt and  was happy to find gluten free pasta on the menu. They even know to use separate pots for cooking  the pasta. Ordered the bologna sauce with a side of sautéed broccoli. It was all fabulous. I enjoyed my meal and had some left overs to take home. The restaurant isn't fancy or trending to the hip crowd. It was baseball caps, sweaT shirts and jeans  for the most part throughout the restaurant. I'd come back for more and don't make it into the north end  area often but when I do, it's always enjoyable. Happy I found this place.> Best way to spend a chilly afternoon, eating good food in a cozy place! Had an amazing crispy stone wood fried pizza with great toppings. Many options for vegetarian toppings as well. Also had a pesto pasta which had one of the best pesto i have tasted.> Best take out I had in awhile. Usually take out isn't as good as dine in, but this restaurant was good! The fusilli carbonara was delicious. Fusilli pasta tasted fresh and soft combined with the creamy rich carbonara sauce. The pizza was great as well! It was thin crust and just the right blend of red sauce with cheese. Will definitely order from here again.> A decent find in the North End.  I came here on a Thursday night with a party of 7 and we were seated quickly without a reservation.  TIP:   whatever pasta sauce you order can be served with any noodle type.  The gnocchi, ravioli, and fusilli are made in house from scratch.  Many people in our party chose one of these with their pasta sauce, but beware there is a $7 up charge.  Our waiter didn't notify us of this which was frustrating. We started with the fried calamari.  Key main dishes from the night include the carbonara, lobster ravioli, and short rib truffle rigatoni.  The pesto was good but VERY VERY oily.  They have an extensive wine menu and it's worth splitting a bottle if you're with a larger party.  The serving sizes are large and the food comes out hot. However, it is a bit pricey compared to what you can get at other restaurants in the North End.","5, 4, 5, 5, 3"

Can't wait to go back for more!!> I keep coming back here because I'm intrigued by the menu... I've tried the Jazz Wrap around 9.50 being the total, the Resolution being around 8.50, and the Mac and cheese side for 4.99. This place does a fantastic job with creating unique and creative wraps that are vegan and vegetarian. The Jazz Wrap was delicious, although it was a little too salty. It was good, but I'm not sure if I would order it again. The Resolution was surprisingly good. The ingredients on the menu seemed bland and boring and just filled with a bunch of greens and shredded carrots, but it was actually so refreshing and yummy! They added the perfect amount of hummus to make it enjoyable to eat. The Mac and cheese was pretty mediocre. I think if there was a place to grow, this would be it! It would be epic to have a delicious Mac and cheese to accompany your meal (option for regular Mac or Vegan Mac for an extra $2). My friend got the Fire wrap and it had a really nice spicy flavor to it. I stole a bite from hers and I think I might try that one next! As for customer service, it's pretty slow. My friends and I waited for about 20+ minutes for our wraps and they were togo. Other than that, I truly do love this little place on the corner of commonwealth avenue!> I got the fire and my partner got the ballpark. It was shocking how our two wraps were so different. Mine I thought was great and ate it all (but was still hungry, so we probably should have gotten fries, looking at the reviews I guess they're really good) His however was burnt to a crisp and a mixture of hot and cold (while mine was all warm). He didn't finish his so I ate the rest of it and was shocked at the difference. Consistency is key and they're not hitting it.> Great food, I love the drumsticks and waffles! I came here with a friend for brunch and was very happy with what I got. I took off one star for the brunch DJ. He started off playing very loud and obtrusive music but eventually turned it down.> I don't know how this place got ANY stars! The food was skimpy and horrible! I got a bean burrito, supposed to have rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce and sauce- it was stuffed with bland dry tasteless rice, spoon full of kidney beans, and nothing. I couldn't even swallow the first bite. My son's Impossible Burger tasted ok but it was super small and flat with nothing on it. And the milkshake was tiny and tasteless!

Overall, a real gem of a place that needs to be supported by the community at large.  Come here and give them your money (and get delicious delicious food).> I've had lunch from here a few times, the sandwiches were good, but nothing to write home about. I also thought they were expensive for what they were, simple subs. Recently, I had their yahoo breakfast sandwich. It's a filling sandwich and different from the ones offered at other restaurants downtown. The Portuguese muffin and the hash brown make it a unique option. It was really delicious and satisfying. Come here for breakfast!> I've since moved from Boston, but I still often think about their Yahoo Sandwich... that's how good it is. Their addition of a hashbrown to a classic bacon, egg, and cheese just takes it to a level that's unmatched. Service is quick, perfect spot to get your breakfast sandwich to go.> Stopped by a local place close to the hotel to grab breakfast. Got the Yahoo, which was delicious and simple - Portuguese muffin with egg, white American cheese, hash brown, and sausage. Staff were nice and quick. Not much seating as it seems like many people were picking up food to go. It seemed busy as people were constantly coming in for lunch orders.

Their falafels are the best falafels I've ever had. Chicken and rice plate with tzaziki sauce. So good> Good:1. The falafel is really good here. Really crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. It's a tad more flavorful than other falafel I've had around the city (maybe a bit more garlic-y). They give you one while you wait too.2. The rice was surprisingly really tasty too. It was well seasoned and the texture was soft with bits of thin noodles throughout. I couldn't stop gorging myself on it.3. The portions here are generous and at an affordable price too. For 1 kebab dinner plate you get a healthy serving of rice, 2 kebabs, a side salad, and a (pre-packaged) serving of a flour wrap.Average:1. Sister and I shared one chicken kabab plate and one lamb kebab plate. Both were just ok, nothing special. We both agreed the chicken was better than the lamb (which was a bit under seasoned). Both were cooked well though maintaining a soft and juicy texture. 2. The side salad was as simple as you can get. Classic fast food greens with a quick drizzle of dressing. Fine for just adding a bit of freshness and variety to the plate.Final thoughts:Come here for the really good falafel or a filling meal that won't make your wallet cry.> Stopped in as I was walking The Freedom Trail.  I was pleased and surprised at how good the food is.The greet you with a falafel and hummus, which was nice.  Had the mixed plate of chicken and meat.  It was quite tasty.  Only thing I wish they had is a spicy hummus.  Their hummus is good, but spicy would turn it up a notch.I will eat here again.> Visited on a weekday afternoon for lunch in December 2018. Pretty decent sized restaurant for a typical take out spot but I decided to take my order and sit in. It was really busy during lunch time but despite of that people at the counter were polite in preparing and serving my order. Food was served hot and tasted really good especially their hummus and falafel.Beef and Lamb Shawarma Meat plate with Rice, Hummus, Falafel and Salad> If you've ever dined at Amelias tacqueria on Huntington this will remind you a bit of it except they temper it with a free falafel while you order. Ordered a falafel hummus combo wrap, it was supposed to come with tabouli but I didn't get any. Be vocal folks.If you order online notice how a combo roll-up w/ falafel is $8.75, combo roll-up falafel/hummus/tabouli is $8.35, falafel vegetarian roll up is $7.85. What are the differences? Why is straight up falafel more expensive and what makes that a combo? How many falafel do they include in each roll-up then?Anyways, it's downtown Boston so eating out is expected to be expensive...

Salad was HUGE, which I appreciated; great salad too--lots of tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled onions, so I felt like I was getting a huge helping of veggies. Reason I only gave 3 stars was because the burger I ordered, medium, was served rare in the middle. The waiter was great, offering to take it off the bill; the manager (Zack?) came over and apologized profusely, and offered to have the kitchen make something else, but since I needed to catch my next flight I declined. The manager took care of the entire bill, (though I did offer to pay for my side salad and coke). I would absolutely give this restaurant another try, since their service was spot on--everybody has off days.

I feel the need to balance the scale -- I stopped here randomly in the terminal gate and was pleasantly surprised. Service was attentive from start to finish despite the many full tables, and the food is on-par with typical airport (ordered a caesar and garlic bread accompanied by a cheaper merlot).No major complaints here.> It did the trick....  Layover to LA and having just off a flight from DC. One was hungry. There's was a few eatery between arrival and departure gate. But all seen more of a quick bite or to go. I had two hours to spare and seeing when we walked by earlier, it was pretty busy. Normally means it's good or a happening place. It didn't take long for us to get seated, though there was one other table available. The wine menu had an ok selection. But the one we wanted wasn't available upon ordering. Waitress was friendly, but seemed like she was the only one working taking orders for the whole place. Did see maybe one or two guys brining out food. Opted for something that's easy to share and not a meal. As some of the dishes that were coming out didn't look appetizing. First off, ordered calamari, but again. They were out just like wine. Swapped it for a the risotto balls. Also had the flatbread and a side of Parmesan fries. It didn't take that long for food to arrive. Fries came with ketchup but server asked if we needed anything else. I asked for blue cheese dressing for the fires, nope they don't have it. Then asked for ranch, didn't have that either. Wow, no ranch or blue cheese at the restaurant. Oh well. Food was ok, it did the trick.Our waitress, the only one working was perky and friendly. Having to basically run the whole place to herself.> It was probably very weird for the kitchen to cook a rare lamb burger, the the first one came out well done  lucky I had a great bartender, Diane, who noticed right away and send it back! Once the rate one came out...what can I say, absolutely amazing!!! And this menu looks much better then the other locations too...but totally willing to give a chance to the North End location one next time!> I always look for local spots when traveling. Local vs chain will win for me, so luckily Boston's Lucca expanded to the airport.Obviously, I love that it's local. This includes the drink list. Bantam Cider and Nightshift Brewing are a delight to see. I'd love to see more snack-able menu offerings. I've had the flatbread, which can feed a few. The minestrone was good but still on the larger side. More smaller bites would be ideal.The service perhaps mimics local. One of the employees (maybe a manager) called me by my name after I settled up, and said I should visit again. Airport restaurants see so many faces regularly, so I shouldn't feel excited, but I think the local charm within was calling. Terminal B is getting a reboot. I'm excited that have Lucca as a new part of it.","3, 5, 4, 5, 4"

The house beers were very good, I had the IPA and Pilsner. Overall I'd rate their beers 4/5! Their food menu was relatively plentiful as well, with tons of appetizer options and food selections. I had the pretzel (which was decent) and chicken sandwich dinner (quite spicy). Other people in our group got pizzas and wraps, which they enjoyed.Service started well, but got slower and slower throughout the night. Also disappointing was the restaurant ran out of deserts, had no candles for my birthday, and simply brought out a cookie and said happy birthday. Kinda lame! Would go back in the future, likely for just drinks though. 3/5 overall.> Not a bad spot! We stopped in for a quick cocktail before heading out of town via the Amtrak station.

We shared some of the small bites, like the pickle fries and pretzel! YUM. There is a good amount of seating and full bar area. Only drawback for me was our waitress.

And across the board, portion sizes were SMALL! The cheese board is very customizable - just let your waiter know what types of cheeses you like / dislike and you'll get some highly recommended options. The Baked Brie was super heavy on the preserves and more reminiscent of a danish than anything. The crab cake was decent, and not large enough! And the Arancini was also decent - its main purpose was honestly just to fill us up because all of the above were simply not enough. Overall - not a bad stop for some light eats and drinks, all the while avoiding the crowds!> This definitely is becoming our favorite Wine and Cheese Bar.

All I know is that you should go to Angela's right now and order anything on the menu other than the chilaquiles (Guy Fieri is a moron).> First stop from the airport was this cozy spot! We wanted a great breakfast that had both savory and sweet options and Angela's was just the ticket! Bonus: all dine-in breakfasts come with coffee! I ordered the French toast with seasonal fruits and caramel sauce. I originally asked for the sauce on the side, but after tasting it, realized I had to pour it over everything! It was very much like dulce de leche and added depth to an otherwise-lackluster breakfast. My husband ordered the chilaquiles with red sauce and despite my hatred of eggs, my mouth was watering at the smell. Crispy tortillas, meat of your choice, beans, and eggs cooked your way smothered in a delicious sauce and it was completely perfect. Prices were good, service was excellent, and atmosphere was cozy! If you are going--stick with the traditional Mexican breakfast and you will be begging for more!> This place is starting to become the beau and I's regular spot for brunch. I love it here. It's a really cute, cozy, and intimate little restaurant. There's always a wait but we have never wait longer than 30mins. The owner is very personal and nice. Coffee is not bad at all. Eggs Florentine is pretty good BUT. They are known for their chilaquiles. We get it Everytime we are here. Everyone comes here for it. Not too spicy, full of flavors, and lots of protein. I can never finish it!! The guacamole is also very fresh here but I wish their were mor flavors to it. Still yummy! Angela's! You have become my new second home :)> One word. Brunch!This small restaurant serves meals that are packed with huge flavor.  We got to brunch around 10 am and I wasn't hungry until ~5 pm that day. The portions are huge! Pro tip- make sure to ask for a bottle of hot sauce for the table. It's a green chili based sauce that makes everything taste even better! I tried the Huevos Poblanos which comes with refried beans, scrambled eggs with ham and poblanos, seasoned pita, avocado, and corn tortillas. The meal was excellent with the exception of the avocado which was rock hard. If you're a coffee drinker, you're in luck. Brunch meals come with free coffee.

I'd say the pancake was not the best I couldn't eat them all, it was really dry.The waitress who took care of me was super slow, I asked for my water twice, I tried to understand that she might busy but she went to tables around me twice but never stop at mine.I decided to take my hot chocolate for to go, I could notice that she forgot about me, again. At the end when she dropped my check and to go cup for my hot chocolate, she poured my hot chocolate into my to go cup and at the end her long nail scoop some of my hot chocolate she didn't notice anything because she was talking to people at another table, I felt like I was a ghost at the place, totally different feeling compare with my YESTERDAY visit ....I was crying inside and decided to not take my hot chocolate away.Please... I'm working in a restaurant too, please cut your nail or at least look at the cup/bowl and make sure you didn't put anything extra.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

But then there are places like this. Instant classics.I'm by no means an authority on jerk chicken, so let me just tell you this: Juicy chicken with deliciously crisp skin and penetrated by the spicy hot jerk seasoning. So good! Sides were excellent as well. I had rice and beans (with a good scoop of jerk sauce over it) and nicely crunchy stir-fries. cabbage and carrots. Can't wait to go back!> This restaurant will have your taste buds dancing and screaming for more. A friend suggested I come here and I was not disappointed. The meat was tender and full of flavor. Many hats off to the cook. The jerk chicken was so fresh and flavorful I thought I was in Jamaica for a hot second. They give you more than your money's worth. When I saw my plate my eyes lit up because it was a good amount of food. The customer service was great quality, the employees were able to answer my questions about certain food which showed me that they care. Overall this place is a must, thank me later for the recommendation!Food: 5 Customer service: 5> Really good food actually better than half the boston carribean restaurants flavor/ taste wise.. Not a long wait time.. Best fried goat  i've had in a while. Pikliz was delicious..> The food here was delicious. Not only was it full of flavor the amount you get for the cost was great. I had enough to eat for lunch and dinner. I'm happy to see a great Haitain restaurant in the community. I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes they offer.> Small take out place with a hot bar (not self serve). I don't know if I recall a large eat in area but there may be a few tables to dine in. I came here on a late Friday night and unfortunately ran out of a lot the items I wanted to try. So I went for the coconut chicken, side of the jerk chicken with coconut ride and a side of slaw. Both chicken was so tender and flavorful. The jerk chicken had a nice crispy skin with a kick to it which I enjoyed better than the coconut chicken. The coconut rice wasn't too fragrant of coconut but cooked well. I'm definitely going back to try the black rice and oxtail next time!","5, 5, 4, 5, 4"

I ended up with the non alcoholic pairing. I honestly didn't want the pairing, but was forced to get it since there was no option to exclude it from my reservation.  The crab ""cake"" with pickled beets mushroom and mascarpone was delicious! Savory yet refreshing in texture and taste.The harimasa tartare torte was satisfyingly in its crunchy texture and fresh fish taste.The foie gras in the macaron was divine! It hit the tspot in full force!! The texture of the macaron was a bit gummy. Perhaps too much xantham gum?? Its forgivable with the delicious foie gras taste.The langoustine dish transported me to a cold winter seafront that playful takes local ingredients and superimposes a japanese vibe without being obvious. The use of apple in this dish further enhances a sweet yet refreshing profile. The toasted rice vinegar was a wonderful contrast of a dark low tone that still comes off light like an old man dipping tea by his winterside window.The harimasa dish was a wonderful two punch combo of lemon and eggplant. The yuzu koshu was just enough to feel like an alley hoop, followed by the slam dunk of the pine lemonade. I love the liquid presence of a nut in this pairing!!The gremolata dumplings dish was a symphony of flavors that stimulated my mind, satisfied my tongue, and comforted my soul. Light in texture, while firm in its sensual profile. Like a multi layered platform, overarching and overlapping in structure and form, the familiar lemon and garlic, tossed in a delicious sour cream, engulfed by a literal cloud of uni foam - this was heavenly.The branzidino looks like it was dressed like pepto bismal, but its actually purple radish. Its the more adventurous aspect of the meal, where some people may be taken back by the sour pickled flavors. This wasnt my favorite, but the fish was cooked just right. Also the drink pairing of apple and thyme vinegar was delicious!!The trout dish was like no preparation of trout ive seen. The best way i could describe it is a northern take on pimento cheese and Chipotle peppers. Low toned, slighty astringent, and funk thats not sharp but hangs like fog. In a strange way, a mild cranberry is a kindred spirit. The hibiscus and smoked maple syrup tonic was an amazing combo that stretches the horizon of this dish. This dish wins me over for such an unusual presentation that speaks my imagination and peaks my curiosity.The squab was solid. Although I would have liked for the texture be c cooked just slightly more, the compromise of a bloody robust punch of the squab is delightful. What really took me by surprise was the squash piece on the backend. Its as if the squash looked at itself in the mirror and saw a reflection of the squab. The squab smiles menacingly as it takes it hooks its talons into the squash to transform it slowly into a squab!! The squab pate crumbles at its foot side hit the t-spot! The lemon ginger drink was ok but I get it was suppose to contrast.The venison dish was a homerun. What a great way to end the savory dishes. The combination of flavors seem odd but end up working well. The acorn puree really hit it home with its fermented power, harnessing this woodsy feel along with a heartiness I would get from a squash. The chef masterfully infuses chocolate into this dish, honing in on the earthy, acidic nuttiness of the cacao bean, while feeling sultry as a chocolate liquor at times. The cranberries were a great choice, further enhancing the chocolate notes, as well as the ""north American"" foraged feel.The lettuce sorbet was a sight to behold, as it pulls off what I couldn't do at home myself: take lettuce and make it into ice cream. I wonder if this place as a pacojet, cause otherwise I don't see how they masterfully removed all the fiber and grit of lettuce for this ice cream. Earthy and ""green"", while still being a sweet, creamy custard ice cream. The cucumber celery granita felt like a drink I would receive from a juice counter at the health food store. The main dessert was quite fascinating in its overall approach. Rather than using chocolates, caramels, or super sweet fruits, the chef here concocts a dessert that seems quite different yet familiar. A pastry puff, with a separate side of ice cream and sauce on the surface, but a beautiful marriage between all three. The hibiscus has the right amount of sweetness to elevate, yet not feel overwhelming. The herbal quality ties well with the pear and rhubarb. The goats milk offers the necessary tang while being easier to digest on the stomach. Everything about this was so satisfying!This is one of those places where it feels like the big leagues, yet the head chef is so humble and nonchalant. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you book this first over any other restaurant in town.> Tasting Counter is so far ahead of the curve that it's hard to know where to begin. The somewhat pedestrian name does little to reveal the many wonders that Peter Ungár and his team have created, but the unassuming frankness is a refreshing trait that extends throughout the meal.For $250 all-in, you get 12 courses comprising one of the finest meals you can find in this part of the country. The food at Tasting Counter isn't so much  about rapid-fire seasonality as it is exploring each storied ingredient to its fullest, often in surprising ways. Lobster broth will be gently foamed and infused with Uni to create an effect not unlike pure umami injected directly into your veins. Kuri Squash will provide a formidable partner to its delicate partner in Peking Duck-styled Squab. Rest assured that every experiment thrown your way is delicious from first bite to last. My personal favorite of the evening was a preparation of Nantucket Bay Scallop, Salsify, and Chestnut blanketed in a torched Tonka Bean Custard that was breathtakingly good.If you drink, go with the wine pairing. The natural wine selection looked fantastic and was so lovingly explained that it was often competing with the food for attention. I went for the juice pairing, which was great but a bit heavy on the fermentation and vinegar for my liking. By the end I felt like I was drowning in Beet Kombucha, and would have preferred something a bit lighter and more refreshing. Tasting Counter may not have the Old World class you might expect at this price point, perhaps to its benefit, but there's no question that Ungár has cemented the start of a very promising legacy right here in Boston.> Tasting Counter has been on my list for a long time. I added it when I found out guests were able to watch the chefs prep some of the food and plate it right in front of you - that was an experience I hadn't had before (until I went to Table at Season to Taste). My husband and I were lucky enough to be treated to lunch this past Saturday by friends who were thanking us for our help with their recent move. (An amazing way to celebrate a friend or say thank you, btw)! The seating is all pre-planned, so when the host or hostess seats you, you get seated where they decide you should go. (Given that the seating is very limited, this makes sense). They are also diligent about food restrictions and allergies, and mark the counter where you are seated so that all the chefs preparing the food are aware if you are seafood averse, dairy free, gluten free, etc.My husband was not eating seafood for this lunch, so there were a few dishes that he got that were, quite honestly, far better than ours. The lobster dumplings we got were tasty, but his gremolata dumplings legitimately stole the show. We all sampled a little bit, and had SERIOUS food envy. The flavor was like nothing else! We also enjoyed the foie gras macarons.The reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because this experience felt quite rushed. I can't imagine being at the 12pm seating, since our seating began right at 1pm and everyone from that seating had to make room for us to come in. We ended around 2:10 or 2:15, so we had extra time, and I don't know what we would have done without it! (I assume the dinner seatings may be a bit less hurried with 2 hours of time allotted, but they also have more courses).The food with the wine pairings was hard to fully enjoy because you couldn't take your time. There were a few times I had to sort of ""chug"" my wine because more had already arrived. Also, when we were completely finished with our meals, there were people still eating, but the chefs and waitstaff were cleaning up all around them, so I think they might have needed to finish up quickly. All in all, a great meal and I enjoyed the whole experience. I'd definitely come back if I needed a place to celebrate something really special, or impress an out-of-towner with fancy tastes.> Lunch here was divine. Each dish was so creative from the welcoming bites (see pics)to the herby ice cream at the end with the moist olive oil cake and crisp pizzelle .Our fave was the lobster dumplings with uni cream. There was also a trout dish with creamed vegetables that surprisingly had no cream and a hazelnut crunch, and dessert mentioned above. The closing bites were also intriguing. A peppery chew, bonbon, and mini canelle was served. The peppery chew was my favorite as it was great to cut through the sweetness of the bonbon. Each course had a wine pairing which was included in our ticket price of $85.Service was impeccable and each plate was presented well. To be able to see the chefs working and garnishing makes this an entertaining dining experience! At the end of the meal I was happily full despite what seems like small portions.> I had high expectations of Tasting Counter based on customer reviews and all the press, but I found the experience surprisingly disappointing.ONLINE TICKETING INPUTS DID NOT TAILOR THE PRODUCTION OF ANY OF OUR DISHES- I had pre-paid for tickets/reservations on the website -- taking time to fill out their forms noting the occasion we were celebrating, as well as dietary restrictions and food preferences.-  While the website touts the online ticketing system and its ability to keep track of food allergies, restrictions and preferences -- there was no acknowledgment of those things when we arrived or as we were given menus.- For my first course, I had to request a modification based on my dietary restriction. For my second course, they also ended up replating it since it didn't take into my dietary restrictions. - We were there on a Monday night, and there was only one other couple there when we arrived. So there was ample space and time to tend to our reservation and food notations.SERVICE WAS ODD, COLD & DISJOINTED- From the moment we walked in, it was strange. A woman was sitting near the entrance, at a computer, but she didn't get up when we walked in. So we found our way into the dining area on our own. - After standing around for a moment, a guy came out from behind the food counter and we gave him the name on our reservation. He seated us. - We were given a prix fixe menu to choose from. It was very cut and dry. ATMOSPHERE WAS FLAT AND LACKED ENERY- The chefs inside the counter looked or acted nothing like the ones in the Google photos wearing white chef coats and hats. They each wore different versions of black, one in a jacket and one in a polo type shirt. They moved quietly and methodically, almost robot like. They were focused, but didn't appear to be enjoying what they were doing. That's how it felt to me anyway. - Later in the evening, the woman who had been sitting by the computer up front came and joined them inside the counter, helping with plating. She wore a floppy fuzzy sweater and had dissheveled hair, and she kept pushing her sleeves up with her hands while she was prepping. For some reason, it struck me as unprofessional and not very sanitary.FOOD WAS WELL-PRESENTED AND INVENTIVEThe food was by far the best part of the night. While I was a little surprised that I wasn't asked how I preferred my lamb loin cooked, it was perfectly medium rare. The desserts were delicious and The appeal of a Michelin calibre menu was a big draw for me to Tasting Counter, but the service didn't deliver on a top-notch experience. I probably wouldn't go back.","5, 5, 4, 4, 3"

I ordered the homemade Carbonara and I'll be revisiting that dish in my dreams over the next few weeks. Why stray to the overhyped tourist spots when you have this hidden gem!> I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate an occasion for dinner. Most of the North End restaurants had a 2+ hour wait or were not accepting any new customers. He found this place with no wait and grabbed a table while I was on my way from work.He ordered tomato gnocchi and asked to make it spicy, which was no problem for the chef. I tried a few bites and it was delicious and very spicy per his request. I ordered the ravioli, which was filling and slightly unique tasting. It was plain cheese filled, but I detected a bit of nuttiness and a drier cheese inside, which was a nice change of pace. For the price for both of our entrees, mine was on the smaller side and my boyfriend's was average.They also give a bread basket (good bread, nothing spectacular) with butter; we asked for olive oil the first time and balsamic on the second refill. It took a while to get the second refill, but we weren't in a rush. I had a tiramisu for dessert (which was actually larger than I expected), which was also good.Service was fine; our water glasses never went empty and our bread basket got refilled once. I do have to say it was a bit slow toward the end of our meal. We waited close to 15 minutes for the check, and there were more busboys/waiters than full tables. The best part about the service was that our waiter was HILARIOUS and quirky; he kept us laughing/entertained all night. It is very intimate in here (I think this used to be a frozen yogurt shop a long time ago), so beware if you aren't a fan of small places. We could hear the conversations of all the groups around us, which didn't bother us, but I could see how someone else might be claustrophobic. The tables can easily be pulled apart/combined to accommodate party sizes, though!Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again unless someone else in my party wanted to. I thought it was a bit expensive considering I wasn't in love with it. Don't get me wrong, it was GOOD FOOD, just not the best I've had in the North End for the price.> It was a really wonderful family dinner tonight with the best service from Justin. Love lil Italy Boston. North End is absolutely the place to find that perfect Italian meal. Everyone damn near cleaned their plates. Even dessert too! We ordered veal, lamb, lobster ravioli, parpadelle alfredo, scallops over risotto and cod over risotto. I got a taste of almost everything. I'm getting too ahead of myself. First off the basket of bread was so good. Started with that. Warm and soft on the inside made to not have just one. I had three. An appetizer, the fried calamari with the red sauce with lemon was delicious too. Lightly battered, not chewy. I just got back into eating seafood from being vegan. It was flavored really well. So then our main dishes came out. The lobster ravioli was warm, covered in thick white sauce,ravioli al dente filled with chunky pieces of lobster. If you are into alfredo though, the parpadelle will probably be the best dish you've ever had. It does not disappoint. And the cod, oh my goodness. I would totally go back for their cod. Those were my favorite from my first visit. Cannoli and caramel flan was a very nice ending. We got lucky with this spot tonight. I called last minute. No reservation, just showed up, and got sat down with a party of 7. They don't seat you unless the entire party is there. Smallest little spot at the back corner with an intimate view of the back office watching servers walk pass holding fabulous Italian dishes, black curtain flying in and out. Great view of the street of Hanover on a Saturday night. Fantastic company. Food I can say was more than satisfying.> Enjoyed a wonderful dinner at this lovely, little restaurant. Plentiful portions of delicious food. Attentive, friendly service. The Caramel Custard may be the best dessert I've ever eaten.> On a Saturday night, there is a reason as to why there are ridiculous lines out the door for two of the restaurants in Boston's North End and why it was so easy to get a table at Casarecce. Like most restaurants in the North End, Casarecce is small and cozy. It was just unfortunate that we got seated right next to the kitchen so it was a little awkward to look to our left and see the servers hiding back there to cut the cold pieces of complimentary bread. So yes, the bread was cold and unimpressive. The olive oil was brought out in a black, plastic, to-go condiment container with nothing else in it. Usually restaurants will add black pepper or their own blend of herbs and spices but nope, this was just plain olive oil. My sister got the Pappardelle Alfredo and while she said it tasted okay, it was just a little sad to see that it was a small plate of pasta for $20. I usually like to try other people's pasta dishes because there's usually enough but I felt bad if I were to take one bite of her dish. My boyfriend's spaghetti & meatballs were unimpressive. The texture of the meatballs was a little too gritty for our liking. The sauce was not great either and a bit tart for our liking. He dumped a whole bunch of parmesan cheese onto it to amp it up. I have mixed feelings about my cod puttanesca. The cod was absolutely delicious and cooked so perfectly. The tomato sauce that was on it didn't do anything to help it so I ended up scraping it off. The theme of the day was ""super tart"" so my tomato sauce was too tart for me. That in combination with the super salty anchovies was blah. The pasta that it came with I barely touched as well because I wasn't into the taste. Pros for Casarecce? You'll get seated quickly and they accept credit card unlike the other well-known North End establishments. You'll also finish your meal quickly because the portions aren't that big. Will we be back? Probably not.","5, 3, 4, 5, 3"

The food is exceptionally delicious and as authentic as can be for Greek. The best part of the experience is the service and atmosphere it provides; very welcoming and attentive servers and staff. We had a wonderful experience and its somewhere I can see us returning over and over again (maybe even with a larger crowd.)> Stopped by here for a quick lunch after seeing the majority positive Yelp reviews. Now I can add to the positivity. Food was cooked fresh, flavorful, and the portions/price were not too shabby as well (although $17 for the octopus appetizer was bit excessive--I don't regret ordering it as a main meal). The food overall was exactly what I hoped for--flavorful Greek such as charred chicken, lemon, and creamy tzatziki! They also bring out a basket of nice chewy bread at the beginning. As for the rest of the menu, they have it all from gyros to salads to dips and anything else you're hoping for from a Greek restaurant--I want to get the Saganaki next time! I was surprised by how packed it was during lunch hour for this sit down restaurant. It seems to attract a local crowd consisting of residents and business people, meaning they have efficient and quick service! It's definitely a solid Greek restaurant where I hope to return soon!> The food was very good! A little expensive for the quantity, but definitely worth it.Dolmades (10$) were amazing! It was so flavorful and the texture was amazing. Usually I don't like the texture of the wrapper, but this one was so tender. The sauce was also very well balanced in lemon flavor.Eggplant salad (10$) was not bad, but very strongly flavored.Octopus (18$) was sooooo good. I've never had octopus with a nearly meaty texture, so it was very interesting! Slightly too salty and definitely pricey, but worth it.Shrimp kebab (18$) was average in flavor unfortunately. The feta on salad (75c) was really good, though the additional price seems not worth it. I had the okra for a side, and it was very tasty.> This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants. We usually go there for their seafood and have always been happy with the freshness of the sea food we ordered. Their staff is very friendly and the place is super clean. If you are craving for a European sea bass then you must check this place out. Oh and also do not forget to taste their hand cut fries with feta cheese on them  if you like octopus which is also something my friends save about in this place.> We liked this restaurant enough to be huge fans.Having been to Athens, we're pretty familiar with Greek cuisine.  Desfina met our needs for Greek food in Boston, and we recommend it highly.Why did I deduct a star?  Based on value, mainly.  We ate at 4:30 pm, early birds, the place was empty, on a Thursday.  We paid full menu price, no specials offered.Comparatively, we were able to get outstanding Italian food in North End and early bird specials at a better price, with salads, dessert, and wine included, M-F.I guess it's all about competition.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

I've never dined in here, but as far as takeout goes, I'd give it two thumbs up.> I ordered delivery and left my phone number for them to call when they get to my complex because it's hard to navigate around the place. A hour and a half goes by and I hear nothing so I call and they told me that they couldn't find my complex so they had their driver go back to the restaurant and take other deliveries. They said they will have the driver come right back and bring my order again. Another 45 minutes go buy still nothing, so I call again and they proceeded to blame the new driver and told me I can keep waiting, so I just cancelled the order.> This place is fantastic, consistently delicious and cheap.

The food is cheap (especially at lunch), is of decent quality and large portions. I came back after they reopened recently, and they're just as good as I remember! Usually, I order either the beef & broccoli or the chicken & eggplant when I eat in. When I take out, I usually get the beef and chinese broccoli chinatown plate, because I think the chinatown plates are more value when ordering to go. The food is also better and the quantity is larger if you eat in, so I would definitely recommend that! I'm definitely going to be coming back again :).","5, 1, 5, 1, 4"

It's a very small diner though, so seating is limited. It's usually packed on a Saturday/Sunday early morning, so be prepared to stand outside in a long line. Thankfully they have a heater though which makes it slightly more bearable in the freezing cold winter months. Not many places opened 24 hours and it will show with the amount of people in line waiting for a seat. Definitely quieter with less people throughout the week. Waitstaff for the most part are friendly minus a few select ones and cooks are efficient! Have only ever ordered the breakfast food, usually the diner combo but will update my review once I try some other things on the menu.> The employee messaged me requesting I not say anything online about poor service after giving a 50/50 review and claiming she did NOT cough in my face. The fact that you were oblivious to doing it the night of in question, means I have no faith or expect you to realize that you did it 15 days later down the road. I am not writing a fake review. I have zero to gain from lying. You coughed in my face and constantly behind the counter near the food cause you were sick. End of discussion.Most of my post was complimenting the food as fantastic. However the owner/employee needs to understand this is the social media age. I can blast on facebook, instagram, wherever I want. So can anyone else. People use yelp for dining advice ans I felt it very important to let them know that yes, the food is great. But my customer service was sub-par due to a sick female employee coming around the booth, coughing in my face and going ""can i take your order?"" And then coughing behind the counter as she handled plates holding food. The message sent to me was from a woman named Aurora, and she was speaking to an officer about how her father recently passed away. Don't private message customers saying ""I ain't cough in noone's face."" You did. It happened. It was gross. Don't come to work sick. You would fire any other employee who did this to a customer, you don't get a pass cause you are a manager or owner. Lead by example.> Solid diner fare, with some very interesting specials. I had the huevos rancheros meat lovers version and it was quite good. Very good service, and my table of 3 got some bonus banana bread which was also good. Decent prices as well, giving it a high value experience. It didn't get get crowded until later in the morning. If it was a little bigger and had a bigger menu, I would give them five stars. Try to come off hours, or there might be a line to get in. A diner to keep on your go-to diner list in Boston.BTW, I have been here many times before, and this place has become a standby for weekend breakfasts. It's a bit of a walk from where I usually park, but it's well worth the steps.> Some places just have a god feel. I am always a fan of the authentic diners. My first date with my wife was at my favorite diner in Rochester, NY the Highland Park Diner. We have been touring around Boston and was struggling to find a place in a Sunday afternoon that would satisfy all people in our party. My wife and I are the east ones. It's my 2 teenage daughters that can be challenging to please.  Especially when one is on the white food diet. You know, pasta mashed potatoes chicken fingers pancakes and nothing spicy. Heavy sigh...........Anyway, I decided that a diner would be a good place to try. To my surprise, this was an actual diner. I looked it up on yelp and it fit the bill. The place is small with counter  stools. I love to sit at the counter as we can talk with the staff. The staff did not disappoint. We had a great conversation with our waitress getting to n is about her and her son who was home with a weekend pass. We did order food. I had been in Boston and did. It have any sea food yet. Although it was past lunch I ordered the lobster eggs Benedict. Big chunks of lobster, delicious. The price was right too about $14 if I remember correctly. The coffee was fresh brewed!  We learned that the diner is open 24/7 and is a favorite among local police, fire and when the bars close. This is another example of a nice find on Yelp. I will go out of my way to come back to this place. Oh by the way this diner was in some movies.> Heard about this popular diner in Boston.  Walked about 10 minutes from our hotel. Didn't have to wait for a table but if you do you have to wait outside as there is no room to wait indoors.  This diner has been there for many years.  The food was very good.  The service was as well.  Most of all the company I was with.  Its a great place to come to for breakfast.  Especially if you are looking for that diner flavor.","5, 5, 1, 3, 4"

The traditional antipasto is stunning and a must have. It is customized to the size of your party and my daughter and I left nothing to take home. Our second course was a home made pappardelle bolognese. I cleaned my plate. The combination of meats in the sauce with just the right amount of cheese and perfectly cooked pasta, made this dish a must have. My daughter has food sensitivities our servers accommodated all our requests going out of their way to ensure our needs were met. Service was on point. As soon as my wine glass we getting low, I was asked if I would like another glass of wine.  The melt in your mouth bone in Oso Bucco was our main course and did not disappoint. Be sure to get a reservation because it fills up fast.> I walk in and an older gentleman asks me, are you from Jersey? I served in WWII with a guy with the same last name. Nope, my family settled in Brooklyn. Now show me those meatballs!It's the first time my wife is dining in the North end, waiting outside for these Italian spots isn't something she's ready to experience. My sons girlfriend is Vegan so my mission was to:1- obtain a reservation2- Vegan options (I always get confused, what the heck is the difference between Vegan and Vegetarian? We didn't have these issues in the 70s..)Terramia Ristorante has a nice menu I was able to make a reservation for 4 with no issues.We're seated in a very small dining establishment. The layout squeezes every table for maximum seating. I'm seeing the wait staff hustle around tables and getting the dishes to the patrons. Our waiter comes over and reads the specials to us. I'm in the mood for some freshly shucked Oysters. Fish is what I wish for dining this evening. But first! I wanna try their meatballs. Man oh man, these meatballs are fire! The sauce is fresh and gave the Terramia meatballs an added depth. There's no fillers in their meatballs, it tastes like mamma Terramia is in the back rolling these bad boys.My Oysters? Fresh and a New England treat. If I lived here, I'd have Oysters for breakfast, it's such a guilty pleasure.The same with the dinner special I ordered, Swordfish Puttanesca style. The swordfish wasn't tough, it was cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the little kick, I didn't see any Anchovies? I did enjoy the capers, this is a must order dish if it comes up for a special.No dessert, the kids wanted to take us for cannoli. (And wait on line..)Terramia Ristorante, we enjoyed dining at your establishment.> Went for the pure reason that they have vegan options - the vegan ravioli and the vegan ice cream - both were delicious. In addition, the group had the mozzarella and the 'regular' ravioli as well the scallop appetiser and another pasta dish, which escapes me now. All were very good - very rich.Is it worth the money - ehhh, not sure but I would go back for the vegan dishes alone.> This was just an outstanding meal during dine out week. Both food and service were exceptional. The inside of the restaurant is small but lovely. Definitely make a reservation. The place was near empty when I got there and full when I left. To start, rustic bread with a cannellini bean spread and olive oil was brought to my table. This in itself was 5 stars. As part of dine out week, I ordered the caprese salad, pappardelle bolognese and chicken Marsala. Everything was delicious. I'll be dreaming of the pappardelle until I return. And the chicken Marsala was exquisite with the chicken cooked on the bone and served over fresh spinach and crisp potatoes. I cannot wait to go back. And I think I'll stay for dessert next time. Can't forget to mention the excellent service by Gabrielle and staff!!!> I have been meaning to write this review for my Valentine's Day date at Terramia Ristorante. It is expected that Valentine's Day is a hectic night for the restaurant industry. We arrived about five minutes before our reservation and had to wait over 40 minutes for our table. It was freezing outside and we were huddled up next to another couple in the doorway. One thing that was upsetting was the fact that a few pairs of people were seated at a table for four with two empty seats each. I wish management appropriately planned the seating arrangements to accommodate for the number of reservations. My boyfriend and I did appreciate the two free glasses of red wine after a colleague complained about the long wait. Although the long wait was an annoyance, it was a well-prepared delectable meal with great presentation and an interesting flavor I've never experienced before. The lobster ravioli was one of the most luscious dishes I have ever experienced. I would certainly eat it again.","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

It felt like being a kid again, so much joy and surprise, and on top of that, I had gone with a group I didn't know well and it was such a good way to get to know people since the teams change often and you play with different people. We left the night like we had been old friends. When I saw they were opening one in Boston, I was excited because I visit often for work. I booked a lane late on a Monday after a work event in Boston and arrived with a bigger group than anticipated. Luckily, the lane holds a good number and you can sub people in and out if people want to stop for a while and chat at the bar instead, so our group was easily accomodated. Our waiter Sam took care of our every need and everyone loved the game and the drinks right away, just like I had my first time in London. I've been recommending Flight Club to everyone I know. Please please pleaseee open a location in Seattle!!> First off, theres not a great selection of upscale bar game hall areas in Boston so I had great expections for Flight Club once I heard it had opened. Initial impressions is that the decor is great and well done and honestly has a cohesive la. However that is where the greatness abruptly ends. The food and drinks were left to be desired.. the titos lime and soda water we got was underwhelming and not strong in the slightest for the money you pay for being in the seaport district. The bartender must have the lightest hand on the planet and the service time for getting the drinks themselves took a while. The food we got was also very subpar. The truffle fries had decent flavor however were lukewarm and cold on some of the fries. Definitely not ideal. The guac was good but the chips tasted slightly burnt. As for the darts which is one of the main reasons I want to come here. YOU HAVE TO RESERVE AHEAD. Otherwise, expect to wait until 11pm or even midnight to be able to  grab a spot. Also I have noticed that while several dart spots were open for well over 20 minutes, that we couldn't expeditite our reservation. I feel that if no members of a reservations party shows up after 30 minutes, then it should go to the next party in the reservation line. At the end of the day I love the concept and will probablly revisit in a few weeks or months to see if things are different. Especially food and beverage wise. UPDATE:I reserved for 12am-1am darts and I showed up at around 11:40 and the bouncer refused us entry as he stated we are ""at capacity"" We wanted to just go in and order drinks at the bar while we wait but he still wouldn't let us in. There were groups behind us who did not have reservations and the bouncer let them in. We had to go out if our way to ask ""why can't we go in to order drinks when other groups without reservation were being let inside after us?"" After that the bouncer apparently says oh you can go in now. ???> Loved the dart games and atmosphere. Service was excellent. Took off a star because we expected more from the food. DO NOT get the Kung Pao cauliflower. All doughy fried breading. Everything we ordered was super salty, including the flatbread, vegetable dumplings, tuna tacos, and al pastor skewers. Hoping the menu is adjusted accordingly.> Admittedly, I had a weird feeling walking in and through this place, which is on the second floor in the same building as Tuscan Kitchen Seaport. It's very circus/fairgrounds, literally. The decor is reminiscent of a circus and the menus are printed in such a way that calls to mind the same. When my friend and I arrived around 7 pm the Sunday before Christmas this week, the ratio of servers to customers seemed off, but it became apparent that servers would be near each game area. We found out after we ordered our drinks at the bar. I had the Butterfly (Citrus vodka, orange blossom, honey, Cocchi Americano, lime, San Pellegrino blood orange soda) and he ordered the Galago (Whiskey, rum, amaro, coffee liqueur, Madagascar vanilla, chicory, cascara). I thought my drink was pretty weak, and this is coming from someone who does not drink. My friend didn't seem that impressed with his drink later. The bartender told us the drinks were pre-mixed. As for the games themselves, I think there were five to choose from. While you can reserve online ahead of time for parties up to 10, we opted to check the place out after dinner nearby and did not have any trouble initially reserving for 30 minutes; we ended up staying an hour so you do have to be mindful of time especially if it's not crowded and you're having fun. We were in playing area three (oche) which offered a nice view of the area outside. I don't think areas five and six were occupied until after we started. Flight Club has a dozen oches where pricing seems to fluctuate during peak times. I don't think it's by individual so it's more cost-efficient to go with a bunch of people. I think the limit might be six people per oche. They have a user-friendly technology to keep track of scoring which helps as where the dart lands in each game has a different value. We played four games and probably could have played one more but decided it was time to cash out.A server stood between our areas to answer any questions and take food/drink orders. He was really nice and attentive but my friend did not think the automatic 20% gratuity was warranted. As we headed out, more people arrived. The space is quite large and seemed so in proportion to the number of employees and guests but I could see it filling up in the evenings and weekends or during social events. I had a lot of fun but if anything, it confirmed I really need to work on upping my game.> We had so much fun going there. This place is always packed now and you have to book in advance. The drinks are very good and the way they are displayed was very different I thought it was great. The food selection is interesting we got a bunch of different things. We got the pizza, the Tacos, the pork on a stick which I didn't love. We stayed there for 2 hours so we had to order the same thing more than once because the food menu is just a little limited in my opinion but otherwise everything was great including the service Definitely a fun place to go","5, 3, 3, 4, 4"

Warm and cozy, with down-to-earth and unpretentious vibes. And yes -- the waffles are delicious too. FOOD: Waffles can be pretty pricey. Our Liege Waffle + Strawberry Glamour toppings and a scoop of ice cream came to $9.63. But it was so, so worth it. The waffle was fluffy and incredibly fresh; the strawberries were sweet and best of all, there were a lot of them. And then the Belgian chocolate drizzle on top was heavenly. The use actual melted down chocolate here, like fondue, and none of the Hershey's chocolate syrup type. This is the real deal. If you're looking to come here to get work done, take note: their policy is no Wi-Fi on weekends (their own network), but you can easily hop onto Berryline's open Wi-Fi network instead. Berryline is directly downstairs so the signal strength is good. Zinneken's is my new favorite cozy dessert place in the square. 5/5 for quality and ambiance.> if you want the best waffles in cambridge, look no further. this little nook has AMAZING waffles - fluffy, crispy, and sweet all in one. there is definitely really limited space inside so be prepared to wait for a spot. however, it's 100% worth it for these waffles. so many different options to choose from and the vibes in here were amazing and warm. it was kinda like being in a little cabin and even if the space was small i think it just added another dimension to the experience!! will definitely be returning here if i'm in boston again.> It was late already after a dinner but we knew we were missing something.... dessert! We couldn't help but stop by this cute little store that we had seen earlier while coming into Harvard Square. When you open the door to Zinneken's, you're overwhelmed by the amazing smell of Belgian pastries and coffee... so amazing! We ordered  #3, the Sins (Banana & Nutella) + Strawberries and a Vanilla Latte to share. The waffle had the nice chewy texture that you want when having a Belgian waffle! Add the fresh fruit and Nutella and you'll have a great dessert to share :)> This is my routine rainy, cold day: go to Santouka for ramen, walk down the street after, go to Zinneken's for a waffle. It's honestly the ideal rainy day. The liege waffle is my favorite. It's warm and soft and chewy - so delicious. The bananas with caramel and whipped cream is my favorite topping combo. I'm not a huge fan of the crunchy waffle but to each their own. The restaurant itself is pretty small so it can be tough to get a table when it's busy. Especially when students are back at Harvard. And i think the waffles are kinda pricey. The menu says $4.70 for the waffle but the toppings will set you back ~$8. However, delicious waffles, cute cafe, good tea!> I L-O-V-E waffles in comparison to pancakes. Especially when warm toppings are involved. A friend of mine suggested here after we had ramen at Santouka because I was feeling for something sweet. It was my first time. We got a crunchy waffle and a soft waffle, personally I love crunchy waffles but the soft one was pretty good too- this place makes the best soft waffle I've had thus far coming from a crunchy person.We got strawberry and nutella on the crunchy and banana, caramel and whipped cream on the the soft waffle. I really enjoyed both I could decide which one I wanted to be the last taste in my mouth.I didn't realise EACH topping was an additional $1. I thought you picked either waffle for $4.70 then any combo topping. I think they should state the additional topping cost at the top of the menu instead of at the bottom since I didn't notice that off the bat. Their topping combo list is very helpful though with pairing each one to another.I'll be back again! Just what I needed on a cold rainy night.","5, 5, 5, 5, 4"
Saigon Chicken House,Boston,4.0,2,No,Null,No,Null,Vietnamese,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,Null,Null,"My friend had been to Saigon Chicken House, but it was my first visit.Saigon Chicken House is across the street from the post office and a short walk from the Red Line Fields Crossing station on the Ashmont line.  It is rather spacious inside with 4 round tables surrounded by rectangular tables and smaller round tables set by the walls.Her impression was that the chicken was good here, but the rice plates were not quite sufficient for an individual's appetite.  so we ended up sharing a half chicken portion of their Special Qui Phi Chicken Steam (Market Price - $20 on this visit), chicken rice $3 (vs $2 for plain rice), and #101 Noodle Soup with crab, shrimp paste, snails, and water spinach $10.95.The chicken was good, but I particularly enjoyed the chicken rice with a good douse of the ginger fish sauce which had accompanied the chicken.  The noodles in the soup were a thick round noodle.  The bowl generous and flavorful with a manageable hit of heat.  The snails found at the bottom of the bowl were a bit rubbery so I could have done without.The special Bo Ne - Vietnamese Sizzling Steak $13.95 sounded tempting, but my DC has her eye on trying one of the hot pots with a larger party in the future.> Came here specifically for their ""Bo Ne"" aka ""Vietnamese Sizzling Steak"" because it's hard to find as not a lot of Vietnamese restaurants offer this item. It comes with two pieces of ""steak"" which is really just basic slices of beef, an over-easy egg, pate, onions, cilantro and green bell peppers. It's definitely a cool dish as it's brought out on a sizzling platter with french bread. You basically assemble the sandwich yourself - spread the pate on one side of the bread and the runny yolk from the egg on the other side. Unfortunately the sandwich was hard to eat because the ""steak"" is tough and hard to bite into - I guess they didn't do a thorough job of tenderizing the meat. I would definitely recommend cutting up bite-sized pieces with your knife first...which is kind of lame. The sauce/marinade was WAY too sweet for me. It was like a flavor explosion but not in a good way. It's a cool dish to try but I wouldn't order it again. It also comes with a side of fries? So strange.We really liked the ""Oc Len Xao Dua"" or snails with coconut cream. You're supposed to be able to suck out the snail from the shell but we were struggling to do that...asked for a few toothpicks to try to pick them out. The coconut cream sauce was delicious. The ""Nem Cuon"" was just okay to me...the nem or grilled pork was much too thin. For such a thick spring roll with so many veggies and a fried egg roll wrapper it needed a much thicker piece of meat. I did like the crunch I got with each bite though from the fried egg roll wrapper inside the spring roll. The dipping sauce was just alright as well. My date ordered the com tam 4 mau and seemed to like it because he ate the entire thing.> The bot chien and bo ne here is absolutely amazing. Our go to dishes that we always get when we come here. The oc xao dua is also pretty good. They give you a pretty good amount of oc and it tastes so good with the creamy coconut sauce. One of our go to spots for Vietnamese breakfast!> I've had my eyes set on this restaurant for quite some time now as it's a Vietnamese restaurant where the main attraction isn't pho like many others around the city. Scrolling through the pictures, it was apparent that their chicken rice dishes and the beef Napoleon are the stars of the restaurant. As this as my first time visiting, those were the two dishes that I tried. Chicken:For this dish, I opted for the dark meat which was $1 more than the white meat option. The chicken comes deboned on top of a mound of rice with what seemed to be some steamed Chinese yu choy, sliced cucumber, and a thick cut tomato. The chicken was topped with a dollop of scallion/ginger, similar to HK bbq places. There's also a cup of soup that came in the side as well. believe it also came with a side of sweet dipping sauce, but not too sure on this as we also got the Napoleon.As far as taste goes, the chicken was actually quite bland. The dish as a whole is reminiscent of the Hainanese chicken rice dishes that you can find in Singaporean restaurants as it has the chicken on top of flavorful rice with a side of soup and dipping sauces. 3/5 for this dish.Beef Napoleon:I actually had a hard time finding this initially as it was the last item on the appetizer menu. This dish consists of cooked tenderized steak (probably from baking soda) in a tomato-esque sauce, a medium cooked egg, some pate, topped with some raw onions, cilantro, green peppers, and a healthy dose of butter on a hot sizzling platter. The dish also comes with a loaf of bread that you'd see used for banh mi sandwiches and French fries. We took chunks of the bread and made mini sandwiches out of all the items on the platter. The sauce on the beef is more on the sweeter side but the star of the show has to be the pate! 5/5 for this dish.All in all, I was pretty satisfied with the meal but the beef Napoleon takes much of the credit. I am actually quite disappointed by the chicken as it is called Chicken House. The restaurant also had an unpleasant smell similar to some Asian grocery stores. Not sure if it's always like that,  it definitely not the best when trying to eat.> Their staple is their farm raised chicken buuuut it was rather anticlimactic. My boyfriend got pho and the broth was oily. I got the chicken & dried bamboo noodle soup with glass noodles and that broth was just super bland no matter how much seasoning I added. The service was slow as well but maybe because they were understaffed and it was busy since it's Sunday. The only good thing we had that I would strongly suggest is their Bò Né, and that's it.","4, 4, 5, 4, 3"

The coleslaw had a nice amount of dill and I wish there was more of it.> Came here while waiting for my colleagues flight to arrive. I ate here because I thought I could use my priority pass membership for a discount on my meal. However, as of last August, apparently they discontinued this benefit. So - if you have priority pass, just know that you cannot use it here anymore. This was disappointing as there is no other priority pass lounge in the B terminal and there is no way to access other lounges in the other terminals without exiting security. I got a coffee (I am an espresso snob but they do not have espresso drinks here) which was actually decent for drip coffee. Also got the caprese panzanella salad. The salad was ok. It was arugula, large chunks of yellow and red tomatoes, large croutons, large chunks of mozzarella and some basil pesto on top. It took a while to come out and when I got it, I didn't understand why it took so long to throw that together. Everything was in very large pieces and just layered on top of the dry arugula. The tomatoes didn't taste very fresh either, felt like they had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while. It sounded like a good idea, but not too well executed. The service was friendly and timely. However the food was overpriced. My salad was $17 and coffee $3. I probably wouldn't eat here again.> Pretty good for airport food.My order: Caesar salad (15) add pan seared steak. (10) cooked medium rare. This salad hit the spot. Very fresh lettuce with no rotten leaves. Steak was perfectly cooked.Con: steak was drastically under seasoned. Though this isn't a problem, as there's freshly ground pepper which was an easy fix.Friendly service (I believe Colin was my waiter?). They immediately ask you how long until your flight, which is lovely.Overall I'd eat here again. Kind of expensive, but definitely tasty.I would have had a cocktail if it wasn't $15> Very friendly staff willing to go the extra mile for an airport breakfast.  Though the menu only has the fruit listed as gluten-free, I asked for additional options.  The grill cook cleaned his entire grill ( they often toast their bread on the same surface so be careful) so that I could have a veggie omelet.  It was so delicious.  The spinach as perfectly wilted with tomatoes that were just cooked enough that they were soft but not mushy and tons of feta cheese.  Additionally, the gluten-free toast was an unexpected surprise!  This is my new terminal B breakfast of choice!","3, 4, 3, 4, 5"

Everything we ordered was delicious but the star of the night was definitely the salt and pepper squid! It was phenomenal. If you're big fan of clay pot rice, this is the place to go. They make them in family size for sharing.  This place serves some of the best authentic Chinese food I have ever had in the USA. It is a small place and no frills but don't be fooled, the food was fantastic. Even as I write this review, my mouth waters at the thought of ALL that delicious food. I will sure come back when is Boston.> It is a great restaurant if you care about the food taste and affordability. It is a bad restaurant if you care about the atmosphere and decorations. The service is good and prompt.We had three dishes for two: Gui Fei Chicken, fried sticky rice and garlic giant mussels. All are amazing! The total price is around $30 before tax and tips. We ended up with enough leftover for next day. Certainly will come back and try more dishes!> This pace was recommended by a friend whom I implicitly trust for Cantonese cuisine, since he grew up in Hong Kong. Came with a couple of other friends and thought the food overall was quite good. Pro-tip: always bring someone who can order off of the Chinese only menu.Pro-tip: I think food is always better with good company.> After eating lunch, I'm sitting here puzzled why this place has so many raving reviews. I ordered their brisket w/ bean curd rice plate and I got more bean curd and fat than actual peices of meat! I counted 3 LITTLE pieces of flesh in there and that was it. Now I see why the plates are reasonably priced, because it's mostly rice and barely any meat. No thanks, I'll stick to my regular spot up the street from this place. I'm giving it 2 stars simply because they are friendly and give good customer service.","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

I do hate that they consistently change their menu to take away my favorite pizza but their pizza is great. A lot of places or people wouldn't believe in such a thing but my wife has a tomato intolerance. She developed it about 7 years ago and it has made my pizza eating life hell. I love pizza. It was something I ate a lot of. And then the intolerance came where she couldn't digest tomato anymore. Pizza became a rarity to me. Then we found Ottos. I was always against the idea of a white pizza. It just didn't make sense to me. But their white pizzas are enjoyable not only for her but for me too. I ask that if Ottos reads this you bring back two. The arugula, pear and blue cheese. And the pineapple and red pepper flake pizza. They were quite divine. If you're adventurous in your food and willing to go against the grain of your typical cheese pizza or your pepperoni pizza give this place a shot. The mashed potato pizza is a great choice. Also the house side salad is great. I love the house dressing. I was mad when that went away but happy to have it back.> OTTO has been on my list for a while and I'm happy that I was finally able to give it a try. From best to just alright are:1. Mashed Potato, Bacon, and Scallion: a really unique combination and taste exactly like a baked potato but way better. Points for originally and overall tastiness.2. Spicy Pulled Pork, Sausage, Pepperoni: what I considered a ""classic"" pizza. What I expected from essentially a meat lovers pizza and it delivered.3. Pineapple, Bacon, Hot Honey: this was my least favorite. Compared to the other two pizzas, it didn't hit the spot for a pizza. You get a wide range of flavors from spicy, sour, savory but still just meh.Definitely want to give their other pies a try next time I'm here.> Need to improve pizza delivery, arrived very cold.  Avoid cookies.  Meatballs good.> I've passed this place so many times on the B line and never once went there until this weekend. It was real cold and snowy outside so when my boyfriend and I went, there was only 1 other couple in there besides us. The lighting is very cool, industrial-looking lighting with just the individual bulbs. There's tons of space. I imagine this place fills up on a Friday or Saturday evening when it's nice out and school's in session. They had one large TV playing the AFC Championship game and they also serve alcohol so it's a pretty good option for game nights, I'd say.We sat down, looked at the menu and once we were ready, went up to order. I had the buffalo cauliflower with no scallions and bleu cheese and boyfriend had a spicy pulled pork one. Both were large-ish pizzas and we were both full after eating them. Great flavor, great amount, crust was pretty good as well. They also have a water dispenser in case you didn't want to buy any drinks but still want to stay hydrated. They have pizza by the slices @ 3.50 but 13 for a whole pizza is not bad, especially for dinner. Pretty typical dinner prices.Really love their buffalo cauliflower pizza so would definitely come back and get some! Right off the B line too, easy pick up.> Nice staff. Quick service. Pizza was ok. Lots of different and tasty options. Unique choices that would surprise you at how good they taste. Depending on the pizza, there are some things I was not a fan of. Others may find it really good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce on the cheese pizza. I found it to be a little too sour. The outside of the crust was dry and lacked taste. If you don't eat the crust, you'll love it. If your favorite part is the crust, go into it without expectations.","5, 4, 3, 4, 4"

When we arrived, our server greeted us warmly and gave us our choice of seating.  You wouldn't know it when you firs walk-in, but they do have ""outside seating"" towards the back of the restaurant.  During the colder months, it's an enclosed outside patio, with heating, which is a great way to shake off the feeling of being cooped up inside.As others have mentioned, it's pricey.  We ordered about 5 small plates from the menu, and had 2 bottles of wine, for a little over $220.  But, the food is great!  We loved everything we ordered (avocado toast, tuna crudo, anchovies, mussels)- with one exception: the cauliflower dish.  The avocado toast is awesome, and while I think it normally comes in 3 slices, since there were 4 of us, our server added an extra slice so the entire table could enjoy - a nice touch!  Our server also very graciously brought us out multiple orders of bread, that broth from the mussels was too good to go to waist! There are 3 things you won't find on the menu:1) tea2) warm drinks3) dessert  Happy Dining!> Select oyster bar does seafood perfectly in Boston. This restaurant is tiny and romantic and a perfect spot for a special evening out on the town. We decided to split the lobster salad and beet salad to start. The lobster salad has large chunks of lobster knuckles, cabbage and radish and is dressed in a light vinaigrette. This salad is a large portion and well worth the cost. The beet salad is the best I've had in Boston. The beets are atop a goat cheese-yogurt spread and covered in candied Pepitas. For main dishes we ordered the swordfish, halibut and sea bass special of the day. All main dishes were delicious but it was agreed that the swordfish was the winner. I have never had swordfish so light and moist. It is seared and placed atop a bed of roasted cauliflower, crispy chickpeas and mango. The special was a seared sea bass on top of a bed of farro with lobster and cherry garnish. The halibut was the least favourite of the dishes, however, it was hard to compare when the swordfish was so unreal. The only downside to this restaurant is that they do not offer a dessert.Overall select is one of my new favourite spots in Boston and a place where I will frequently return.> Select was really good. I had the Arctic char ($33) and it was one of the best fish entrees I've had in a while, cooked to a perfect medium rare with a beautiful crisp skin. The octopus and salmon crudo were also good, although less memorable. The oysters were great as expected, and offered a nice local selection if not a particularly expansive one. Our waiter was really nice and attentive as well.A couple of things to know--it's very expensive. Like others have mentioned, when factoring in the included 20% gratuity you should probably expect to spend around $100-120 on dinner for two. Another thing, there are no dessert options, which is fine since there are plenty of walkable options around, but keeps the experience from deserving the full five stars.> My husband and my go-to for date nights. We've tried most items on the menu, all of which are amazing. You can't go wrong. We always ditch the main entrees (which are good, don't get me wrong) and get a million appetizers. Our favorite is the salmon crudo that comes with pistachio oil. Ask for bread to dip in that oil. Talk about foodgasm. Another favorite is the octopus. If you think that sounds gross, you can go be a loser and miss out on life.Service is always amazing. Get a reservation.> Terrible service experience, and from what I've read of other reviews, Select does NOT respect its customers and appeared Dishonest in its communication. We had a 7:45 dinner reservation for a special occasion. Recognizing that we were running a little late due to traffic and parking condition, I called Select as a courtesy. The man who answered the phone immediately responded ""just so you know that would cut into your dinner."" And proceed to put us on hold. Excuse me? I didn't realize that we had a time limit to our dinner. Looking up on OpenTable yielded plenty of availability in the next hour. I'm not sure if we only had 30 mins time limit to a potentially $200+ dinner but seemed to be so according to this logic?We gave up waiting after 5 minutes on hold. Afterwards, I've tried calling them back a couple of times and got an answer machine.As a frequent restaurant goer, I've always wanted to give a place a try and disregard the occasional bad reviews. But I will not tolerate disrespect. If you are still considering this place, just read about the reviews of similar treatments that had happened to other guests in the past, and SAVE your special night.","4, 5, 5, 4, 5"

We were greeted and seated immediately as we were they before the dinner rush and were given a run down of the menu. I started off ordering the  New England clam chowder (local clams, potatoes, celery, carrots, bacon, and cream) and Flemish Red Ale.The chowder was really good with large chunks of clams, potatoes and a very cream sauce that really hit the spot on a cold day. The Flemish red ale was also really good so much so that I ordered a second one. Red Ale's are not always readily available in my home town so this was a nice surprise. For my main course, I decided to go with the Seafood Stew (fennel, onion, tomato, local clams, shrimp, fresh PEI mussels, Spanish chorizo) served with a Baguette. The addition of Spanish chorizo to a seafood dish really peaked my interest so I decided to give it a try. When it came out, it looked and smelled delicious. All the ingredients were fresh and the zesty, lemony broth brought it all together. It was a no brainer to use the baguettes to soak up all the broth and not waste any of it and I didn't. All that was left were empty clam/mussel shells. Overall, this is a great neighborhood type restaurant/pub to come relax and have good drinks/food with friends and I look forward to coming back.> Best kettle fries and dip I have ever had!Hubby loved his clam chowder and salmon BLT.Excellent lamb burger.Great service.> Fish and Chips, solid! Clam Chowder good. Flatbread pizza little bland. Steak Egg Rolls very good. Root Beer on tap is like mainlining sugar, very flavorful, could have used some ice. Over all a winner. Was staying at hotel next door. Enjoyed.> My damn my damn! Excellent service and even better food!Had an amazing waitress (don't know her name bust she's from Lithuania) gave me some great recommendations and kept a smile on. The music made me feel is if I was at an old school concert of 70's and 80's R&B. Jam, after jam, after JAM!!Ambiance is very chill but yet live. Definitely, a place for families and friends.  I had the Colombian skillet and the mimosa little bar. Phenomenal! The seasoning on the home fries were really tasty. Scrambled eggs were done just right and the pull pork was beyond flavorful. If I could give this 10 stars I would but I'll give the requirement, five lol. Great place for brunch> Expected this place to be your average tourist trap given its proximity to the Freedom Trail on the way to Bunker Hill. However, I was pleasantly surprised by their brunch offerings. I had the Charlestown omelette which is a simple ham and cheese omelette (sans the included onions/peppers). The omelette comes along with toast and home fries. The serving was more than enough for the price and everything seemed freshly prepared. Service was friendly and good. Would come again if in the area.","4, 5, 4, 5, 4"

Seems like it would be a cool spot on a game day.> We came upon this place as it is located right by Fenway Park and it was a good find. They have a good selection of beer, lots of American classic eats and the prices were fair especially for their location. I had a chicken, bacon and blue cheese sandwhich which was on special and it was delicious and huge!! The fries were my favorite part. They were crispy and airy. Everyone liked their food. They even offered gluten free buns which is a plus for my boyfriend with allergies. Downside was they were very understaffed with one girl doing over 7 tables so it was hard to order drinks or ask for things but she did her absolute best and was sweet. Also the soda had a bad taste to which she gladly replaced with water and apologized. We would return in the future when we finally get to see the red socks in season.> Went recently and it was dead. Two others at the bar. Got take out. Was missing one item, one item was wrong and one was just awful. Roasted pear salad had raw shaved pears on it. When you order tots for your kids you get sweet potato fries. I just ordered from somewhere else. Staff was nice though but how was everything that wrong and bad if nobody was there?Okay. It won't let me reply to the response given to me. Instead of an apology how about a reimbursement for getting it all wrong Joe?> Really annoyed with this place. I came here looking for some good beer and a soft pretzels with cheese. They didn't have either!!!! The yelps pictures of the pretzels were old and they no longer carry them on the menu so BEWARE! Call and check before you think you're getting something good lol. The beers were alright- average- nothing special. Many of the beers I wanted they were out of.

Hojoko is one of Boston's more trendy restaurants that will guarantee a good time for both smaller and larger groups (and those with dietary restrictions).They offer ""bowls"" for those of us 21+ in sizes for 2-3, 4, and 5+ people. My friends and I ordered the Fumador, and while it might not have been quite *worth* the amount of alcohol for the total price, it was still a really fun experience. The food matched the drinks, great tasting but potentially a little on the expensive side. I had the tuna burger which had wonderful flavors and INCREDIBLE McDonalds-like fries, and my friends enjoyed their noodles and sushi as well. A member of our party is allergic to both eggs and gluten, and our waitress who was incredibly well versed in the menu, readily accommodated his restrictions. Further, when bringing out each dish, they would announce whether it was one of the gluten/egg free ones.> I met up with a coworker last night for drinks and snacks at Hojoko (previously the Howard Johnson's from way back) to see what it was like. We got there around 5:30 and sat at the bar, as we were the first ones there.The bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly and poured a very good cocktail (shout out to Jen!).Well the food was very delicious I was a bit disappointed by the cost/amount ratio. We started off with an order of fries and the chicken win from the Robata Grill. The fries are shoestring style and very hot & tasty. The wings while hot and delicious were lacking in numbers; only 3 wings for $9 - yikes. Then, we ordered chicken tails (there's such a thing) skewer for $6, Kurobuta pork belly skewer for $6 and the sashimi salmon for $9. Both of the skewers were tasty and easy to eat, but didn't have a lot. Then, the sashimi salmon was excellent, but only came with 4 thin slices.So, we had a nice time, but I left still hungry and wondering how it all came to just under $85. I guess that's what you get when you mix trendy and the new Fenway neighborhood.> Came here with some friends last night around 11. The man working the door was very strange and pushy even though there was no line. They were what I would call a normal amount of busy for a Saturday night but appeared to be extra busy as two bartenders were running around like lunatics trying to serve everyone,while the other two moved at a snails pace sipping on their own beers more than serving others. One bartender took our order first, then continuously got distracted taking other orders and serving people that came to the bar far after us , that he actually  had to come back and ask what we ordered again. No apology. And then still closed someone's tab before making or drinks. Fast forward a full 25 minutes, and we finally have  our small, decently tasting $13 a piece cocktails. Recap: overpriced and very poor service, but cool vibe.> Love the vibe here. Dark, colorful, retro. Saw music and ate delicious prawns the first time I came. The second time I tried the funky chicken ramen with a friend- which was wonderful. The noodles are great- the flavor has a nice salty punch, and the chicken and gooey egg on top are amazing. This past time I came for a late night bite with friends. They got fruity drinks- mai tai, and a passion fruit drink. We had the funky chicken ramen, wings (half soy garlic half gochujang), and the kimchi fried rice.  The gochujang wings and ramen were the stand-outs. My friend liked the crispiness of the rice (which had thick cut pieces of bacon and shrimp).Update! Came back- still lots of fun. Started with Jasper's rum punch for 2. Very fruity and icy (lots of ice- gets hard to drink towards the end). I appreciated it more towards the end of the meal, when the nutmeg topper along with the fruitiness added a nice touch.Nori taco is the show stopper- fatty delicious fish, crunchy nori. Shrimp toast was also delicious. It's like shumai with a crunchy exterior. Never had that before. Awesome vibe here. Come, it's so fun!> This place has great vibes for a date or group outing. The decor is rock/retro/eclectic with Japanese touches - all kind of odd when put together but also entertaining. Highly recommend making a reservation, so you don't have to stand outside and wait in the cold!My boyfriend and I both had sake. I had the Kunizakari Nigori (unfiltered sake), and I loved it. It reminds of the Chinese fermented rice dish (tian jiu niang). In terms of food, we loved the salmon sashimi, crispy nori taco, and spicy miso ramen. The Hojoko cheeseburger was good but underwhelming (also not worth $18). Service was decent. Prices were a bit steep, but a date night in Boston is pretty much going to cost $80-$100 with food and drinks. Happy to have found another place for Asian/fusion cuisine.","4, 3, 2, 5, 5"

The service was very quick and efficient after I ordered!Overall, I had a great experience and I loved the blueberry cheesecake a lot!

They give stellar service and have an extensive gluten free menu. I got the BLAT sandwich and it was incredibly yummy. They have a stellar latte as well. Really the best part of this please is the ambiance- full of white bricks, and wood finishes it's a really beautiful natural light spot.

The food here was alright, not amazing nor horrible. The service can be a hit or miss. This area is also mainly frequented with college students, so it can get rowdy and chaotic. I would usually order crispy chicken fried rice which is pretty good, though the portion size isn't the biggest.If you need thai food and can't walk any further, Pho & I will do. If you want amazing thai food, walk 5 more minutes and go to Pho Basil which is closeby.> Ordered Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea ... liked the place the hostess is not super friendly but overall her service was good and acceptable.I like that you can eat at the bar area allows for quick turnover :)Unfortunately the pad thai had a melted chemical flavor. Maybe the plastic utensils they are using in the cooking process. Tastes like pad thai plastic special> This is a very decent Vietnamese establishment. They shine with their tom kha soup and the seasoning on the beef.I had a vermicelli and beef noodle bowl and Tom kha soup. The soup was on par with all other places for this soup. The vermicelli bowl was good, but the portion of beef was not really enough. It was deliciously seasoned though. The overall bowl was a smaller portion than you'd expect, but it was enough for me for dinner. If you've got a big appetite, expect to finish it.The service was fine, and when they got my order wrong it came out correctly within 5 minutes. - I had ordered soup in the beginning so I wasn't starving.My friend has the pho (with beef) and she said that the beef was abnormally good, but the broth tasted more veggie based to her. She was not a fan. I'm giving this three stars because I'd come back here willingly. I'd likely check out other options first though.> The seafood dish was extremely spicy, but had 5 mussels and nice shrimps and scallops.  Drunken noodle was great.","4, 3, 2, 3, 4"

If you do, then you're lying to yourself. Other than their poké, I've tried everything else on their menu (pulled pork, mochiko chicken, BBQ chicken) and they never disappoint. They even make sandwiches too?!? Thanks for bringing island flavor to Massachusetts.Much Aloha,Ben T.> Truly the king of poke in the Boston area! The energy is lively, and the people are so friendly and approachable. It's a pretty casual space - you order at the register and pick up your plate at the counter. Also, the art on the wall really added to the ~seaside~ vibe and made for a really pleasant dining experience. I got the salmon poke bowl, which was really delicious! In addition to the super fresh and well-seasoned fish, I also loved the cucumber kimchi and crispy chickpeas. We ordered the banana pudding (I love tapioca so this was a huge hit) and wanted to try the pineapple cake, but they were sold out around dinner time. Definitely looking forward to coming again!> Had my first visit here yesterday and I was completely wowed and regretted that why I hadn't found this hidden gem earlier. Food was insanely good and the service was also amazing! I ordered the two protein plate and chose the shoyu salmon and fried chicken. Salmon was very fresh (I think they cubed it and seasoned it after I placed my order?). The fried chicken was very amazing: crunchy on the outside and juicy and tender in the inside. They also coat it with a honey glaze seasoning, which gave another kick to its already amazing flavor. Side dishes include a salad, some pickled cucumber and fried chickpeas. Those were good too.For dessert, I got both the banana pudding and the pineapple cake. YOU HAVE TO GET BOTH BECAUSE BOTH ARE INSANELY DELICIOUS. The pineapple cake, which is what the restaurant is famous for, completely change my biased opinion towards pineapple cake. Before I tasted this one, in my mind pineapple cake was dry, overly sweet and boring. However, this one was super delicious. They glazed the outside with some form of sugar, and after baking or caramelization, the outside became super crunchy. The cake itself was also not overly sweet and the pineapple flavor from the top of the cake was strong. For the banana pudding, it had tapioca in the inside, which added a very interesting texture to the pudding. On top, they put some crunchy cereal and coconut cream, both of which balanced very well to the overall texture and flavor. Again this one was also not overly sweet too, love it! The server here also recommended another way of eating it: put the pineapple cake inside the bowl of banana pudding, and have them together. I tried it, it was good, so get both desserts lol What also impressed me here was the service. Apparently there were a lot of old customers from before the restaurant was closed. When they came in they all greeted with the workers here and expressed how excited they were when they found this place reopened again. Customers treated the workers as friends, and vice versa. When I left, the workers here also said my name and said goodbye to me :)So warm and welcoming! I will definitely come back and check the other dishes that I was not able to try out this time!> We grabbed some take-out from here a few weeks ago, we planned on eating there but all the tables were full. I love the atmosphere and the staff was super friendly, surfboard used as a table for chopsticks, forks, napkins, etc., is such a cool idea. I got the Kalua pig sandwich with mac salad, sandwich was huge and delicious and I am in LOVE with the mac salad, but the portion was very skimpy. My son got some kind of tuna poke bowl which of course I had to try and it was excellent, even the white rice is really, really good. I wish the place was a bit bigger and open more often, but it was a real treat. can't wait to go back.> Update: They are only open during the weekends!Came back to Manoa after a year or two, with a big craving for the deliciousness served here. I ordered a mix plate with salmon belly and spicy tuna- it was perfection. For dessert, my friend and I couldn't decide between their signature pineapple cake or banana pudding, but the guy who takes the orders gave us the banana pudding for free so we could try both! What a gem. He is such a pleasure. Anyway, food was amazing as always, and the dessert blew us away too. I knew the pineapple cake was good from last time, but the banana pudding tasted so fresh/natural (like, the taste of REAL bananas and not just sweet yellow goo) and had tapioca in it so that was definitely my favorite. The prices are fair because it is so so good and the service is always a pleasure, so no complaints. Can't wait to be back- wish it wasn't just weekends!","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

This place has it all, ranging from savory rice bowls to hearty salads as well as breakfast/brunch options that I have yet to try. Their menu is super long and diverse that anyone should be able to find something to their liking.I got the winter vegetable wild rice bowl (warm wild rice mixed with baby spinach, celery root, sweet potato, dried cranberry, toasted pumpkin, sunflower seeds and black sesame served with sherry dressing and labneh (yogurt cheese) - $11.50. Very tasty with a creamy texture and healthy ingredients. My friend got the maple, squash and chicken salad that comes with a roll (mixed greens, roasted butternut squash, acorn squash, carrots, delicious chicken breast topped with toasted almonds and dried cranberries with maple labneh dressing) - $13. The chicken was the right texture btwn chewy and tough. Ask for the dressing on the side tho, since default is to mix the dressing into the salad.We then finished off with a mixed fruit tart ($7), which was heavenly. Topped with blackberries, blueberries, and a strawberry, this pastry was creamy and memorable without being overly sweet. I had the iced americano ($3 for small), which was smooth and perfect with the tart. In summary, Tatte has excellent food and desserts of high quality, all tastes were of good balance without being overwhelming, for reasonable prices (desserts might be on the pricier side), and food is served to you at the table. I'll be back to try their other items!> At 8:30 am this past Sunday, I strolled in surprised to see customers planted at tables and enjoying food and drinks. I loved how the corner location of this Tatte was illuminated by the morning light, which is further amplified by the nearly floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the store. There are various configurations for seats, including along a counter that is the length of one side of the cafe and faces Atlantic Blvd. and small circular tables for individual, pair, or small groups where the seats are either individual chairs or banquette. There is also a long table for more communal seating and bar seating where drinks are made. Pendant lights and sconces provided additional lighting. I listed four pastries and the server waited until I was done before grabbing them even though she was standing right in front of them. The ham and cheese croissant was interesting as it had wholegrain mustard slathered inside. I liked the kouign-amann for its sugar sprinkled layers and buttery and sweet flavor but I didn't think it had a crispy enough caramel coating on the exterior. While the chocolate within the chocolate croissant was good, I wish there was more, either with chocolate drizzled on top or folded more evenly within the pastry itself. Here, the chocolate came in the form of two cigarillo-like forms, spaced on each end of the croissant. Also, when it comes to chocolate croissants, I have yet to find a place that makes the croissant the same as a regular croissant. Of the four, I preferred the almond croissant most. I liked that the croissant tasted croissant-like, that it was dusted with powdered sugar, and that it had both almond slices on top and almond paste within the layers of pastry. I thought the pastries were good, but a few could have benefited from being warmed up, which was not an option offered to me. (I'm not sure it is one.)Service was excellent; everyone spoke clearly, smiled, and was eager to help and answer questions. I haven't been to Tatte in awhile so I was a bit overwhelmed. There were laminated menus on two small tables, as well as a whole display area of pastries. In the display case, two pear pies, an entire cinnamon walnut coffee cake, a honey apple cake, several pistachio, cherry tarts, an entire orange upside down cake, and a pear almond galette were all neatly and prominently arranged. For most of the pies, slices or the entire thing could be purchased. Behind the cashier, there was also another wall menu and a separate area for drinks. It's also worth noting that items were clearly labeled with their names and prices.> This is a solid place.A bit on the pretentious side, but most of what is available is really good.I've always had really good service and knowledgeable help when I had a question.Service is quick.A bit on the pricey side.  That is, the value isn't there, but it is always tasty.If you have a lunch date, you can't go wrong here.> Visiting Boston for a few days with my husband and we were recommended Tatte for breakfast on our first day. It was AMAZING, and I am so sad we don't have Tatte on the west coast. This was the best shashuka I have ever had, and it was big enough for us to share. The house latte was also delicious and the pastries looked amazing. I loved the atmosphere too, it was crowded, but there was a great energy in there. When we come back to Boston, we will 100% be back at Tatte.> A lot of brunch places seemed to be closed on Sunday, but luckily we were passing by and this place was buzzin. There were a lot of people so we saved two seats before ordering. My bf got a muffin which was good and bottled carrot juice which was surprisingly okay because it wasn't too carrot-y. He also got egg in a hole, adding ham. I got the croque madame - the ham and cheese were delicious. I think you can get black coffee and tea at the regular counter, but other drinks have to be picked up at the coffee bar. The decor was simple and clean.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

Seating available there if you would like to eat in. I also love the compostable take away boxes if you are looking to eat out. Highly recommend.> My friends and I stumbled upon this place while we were in the area looking for sushi. I ordered a sushi burrito with shrimp tempura -- the shrimp was stale. I would like to believe it was a bad batch. However, my friends ordered poke bowls and they seemed to enjoy it.The workers work well together and are very quick.> Yum! Was working from out of town and needed to grab a quick lunch nearby. Located in the seaport district, it was easy to find and a quick order using my Ritual app. The bowl was loaded and the sauce was tasty. One downside: there's no complimentary water..> This review is for the porter square location which doesn't have a yelp page yet...save your money and your time. I was excited to have a poke location close to home but They have a shortage of toppings to add into your bowl (granted you're limited to four) and the protein doesn't taste as fresh as what I've had at other places. Also, they barely add sauce to your bowl so it's lackluster protein without a sufficient amount of sauce to mask this issue. That being said, Ill head to pokeworks in Davis Sq. Comparable price point, more options, bigger bowls. Perhaps the underwhelming food is due to the recent opening but I wont be returning to find out.> Another Poke Place in the books for me! I got a Make Your Own Regular Cold Proteins with White Rice, Fresh Tuna and Salmon, Corn, Seaweed Salad, Red Onion, Sriracha Mayo, Tobiko and Jalapeno - which is typically my ""go-to"" range of flavors give or take a few things. I enjoyed it and it was fairly fresh. The one thing that my coworkers didn't like was you couldn't mix the hot and cold proteins which we didn't know about until we got there, so they were super bummed about that. Unlike a lot of places, this Poke place charges an extra dollar for Fresh Tuna, which I think is silly since almost none of the others do.It was a tasty poke bowl and filling, as is every poke bowl I've consumed to date from all over the country. Poke is honestly one of my favorite things to eat, so I would totally come back here if I were in the area. It definitely does not beat my favorite Poke place, but it works.","5, 3, 4, 2, 4"

We have been here a handful of times since moving to Boston and it's always a blast. We always get the D20, a random drink from one of twenty secret cocktails not on the menu. They give you a card to track how many of the 20 drinks you have tried, with even more secret options available to those that fill out the whole list. This has been a fun way to try cocktails we would never order on our own! We have three each so far, but we hope to try them all. The bar tenders wear dated outfits, and never break character. One even wears a monocle! Limited seating. We've never eaten there, but it's a full restaurant too. Parking may be difficult. Update: maybe we had one too many and started seeing monocles> So I've been coming to this place for the past 3 years consistently - hands down favorite restaurant in Boston. From the extraordinarily friendly staff, to the fun drink programs (proudly a DM2), and the amazing food, you feel at ease and almost at home every time you visit. I've only had amazing experiences at this place and always recommend Parla to everyone I know (and sometimes strangers when I can). I can't believe it took me so long to write a review for this place but I definitely recommend you stopping by for a drink, a bite to eat, or both! Also the music is always on point - just a spectacular atmosphere. I know I'm missing a lot and not providing crazy detail - check it out for yourself. My words won't be able to match your experience!P.S. Parla is the reason I like pickle backs now> The place to go if you want to be robbed. Went for a drink and apps. We got right in, took a while to have a waiter come over (about 15min), despite having two servers and a bar tender. We ordered apps and drinks when he came over. They came out and were great! The time to cash out came, got the check and spilt it. Christmas Day- woke up to find out the server added an extra $60 to my tip! Luckily I had saved the receipt and my credit card reached out and I was able to flag it. When we were leaving one of the waiters was saying they were all full with a 2 hr wait. The people started leaving and he goes 'tis the season'. Clearly it's the season for scamming their guests - happy holidays you thieves.> DINNER REVIEWMy girlfriend and I walked in here on Wednesday night around 8 PM for dinner and were seated immediately, right next to what would be the window but there was no window!). I had heard good things about this place and it seemed like they had some modern takes on classic Italian dishes. This is not your typical North End Italian restaurant.SETTING: This place is small and has a cute bar in the back. It maybe seats 20 people. You will definitely be able to hear the conversations of the people next to you so don't plan to come here if you're looking to have a private conversation.DRINKS: We didn't order any but I have heard great things about the drinks. They have this dice you can roll where each number corresponds to a drink so you can let fate choose your drink.FOOD: The menu is small for a North End restaurant (which I like) but it definitely has some things you wouldn't find on a classic old-school Italian restaurant menu (i.e. ceviche, patatas bravas, chicken & waffles). They also refer to a certain section of the menu as ""(Biggie) Smalls"" and they have a picture of Notorious B.I.G. So again, not your typical North End Italian restaurant.Fresh Burrata - You cannot go wrong with burrata and this was no exception. It came with fresh bread and tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. Would definitely order these again.Ricotta Fritters - These were yummy fried dough/cheese balls but there were only 4 to the serving which I thought was somewhat skimpy for $9. I would skip these.House Made Pappardelle - fresh pasta with a delicious homemade lamb ragu. My only wish with this was that it was a bigger serving.Overall, it was a great experience but I would want to check out other places in the North End before coming back. Don't come here if you're looking for huge portions.> We popped in when we saw two open bar stools to kill some time before a dinner reservation. We were happy it wasn't too crowded since it was Friday night (this place is tiny). All the staff we encountered were really great and bartender - really welcoming.Come here for the experience! From tossing and flipping cups to the outstanding old fashioned mustaches, this place is really unique. We tried the Dungeon Master game, where you roll a legit metal 20-sided dice across the bar for a surprise $15 drink. I rolled a Smoke in the Sunshine and it was good! I may not have picked this on a list so I'm happy it pushed me to try something new. We'll be back next time we are in Boston!","5, 5, 5, 1, 4"

They have benches for you to sit outside, which is fairly good for a place on Newbury st. The doggie ice cream comes with a little cookie on top as well> Great icecream and service! We needed a couple minutes out during the coronavirus quarantine and decided to walk over to JP licks, it was a great walk and break from social distancing. They had tapes placed 6 feet apart in line and the employees were wearing gloves and friendly. Lots of options between sundaes, ice cream, icecream sandwiches! Only thing I didn't like is that they don't offer napkins, despite asking. But other than that I think my fave local Bostonian local icecream shop.> Better than JP Losman's (they lose customers as much as their owner lost football games), JP-a-nese (they just sell Matcha Ice Cream, which gets old - literally, because it's imported from Kyoto), and JV Looks (which are the weird glances and stares I used to get on my Junior Varsity team).But on the whole, I'm not a fan of this chain - and especially not this location.I have to be honest and say that I found the ice cream to be extremely overpriced and the service to be extremely unfriendly - to the point where I almost walked out. I haven't tried this franchise before and after this experience I highly doubt I'll be trying it again.The ice cream wasn't awful, and despite the prices and it being a local chain, I may have given 3 stars, but the service absolutely blew, the guy was really confrontational while also being disinterested and abrasive, and even if it would have been one of my favorite ice cream places, when the price is this high, you really expect the best of everything just to justify it. Mediocre product and the worst service I got in Boston, basically.> I love JP Licks and that I can count on each location to offer up a great product that is consistent. The folks here were super nice which is also consistent at each location I go to. I can always count on their amazing hard fro yo mint chocolate chip - it is DELICIOUS! And fro yo is good for me right? Like a salad? :)My only complaint about this spot - though minor... I needed to use the facilities before heading back out into the night. The line is tight and consistently long - it is roped and keeps two rows of people VERY tightly together so it is nigh impossible to get through to walk to the back of the restaurant which is where most of the seating for the place is and also where the restroom is at. SO, you get through the two rows of line which leads you to the front door completely screwing you from going to sit in the back or using the restroom...without squeezing through the throng of humans vying for their treats.> Based on the constant line, it's safe to say that this local chain is a Boston favorite. I give it a solid four stars. I love that they have inventive flavors that rotate monthly. I ordered a small cone with strawberry rhubarb and banana cookies 'n cream. The strawberry rhubarb flavor was good, but I didn't really taste the rhubarb. The banana cookies and cream was delicious and packed with Oreo cookies.One star lost for prices (they're a little high). And while flavors/consistency are solid, there is definitely better ice cream out there.","5, 4, 2, 5, 4"

We had pre-ordered on our phones before heading over, but by the time we arrived 10ish minutes later, they hadn't even begun making three out of our four pizzas despite the store being pretty empty. Luckily we weren't in a rush, and after another 5-10min wait we all received our orders.All things considered, they do a decent pizza here if you're a thin crust fan. I appreciate that they offer ""edgy"" toppings like mission figs, white beans, and Beyond Meat, as well as the option to order just a half pizza. Call me a heretic, but I thought the figs and beans worked as toppings. Added more flavors and textures and felt like I was hitting more food groups with my pizza ;)Our curiosity and sweet tooth got the better of us so we also ordered the chocolate chunk cookie pizza. It's baked on the same thin crust as their normal pies but topped with ricotta, cookie dough, and powdered sugar. It actually wasn't super sweet, maybe because of the ricotta. The cookie dough ""chunks"" looked substantial but collapsed into hollow shells as we bit into them. It was worth trying, but I probably wouldn't get it again.I've also been to the Blaze Pizza several doors down. Whenever I'm in a thin-crust, smaller portions kind of mood, I'd probably prefer Oath. But I haven't decided whether Oath or Blaze is better overall. Only way to figure out is to chow down more pizza...and break the new year's resolutions I just made.> I have always gone with oath because the crust and vegan cheese options are delicious. However I rate 3 stars because the attention to detail these last 3 orders were slim to non. I get the vegan cheese Bc I have a severe dairy sensitivity and cannot consume cheese. I always put in the notes dairy allergy in all caps yet every time I order a salad from them (now no longer simple salad ) I'm stuck w getting Caesar salad. I have asked previously and was told no dairy in dressing so ordered no cheese but with dressing. Then second order got cheese and dressing. Got sick Ordered one last time and wellll got no dressing ( to find out there's dairy on it!!!!!!!!!!) and cheese on salad. Like A. CAN THE FOOD PREPARERS PAY A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION Please!!!!!! I won't be ordering from here again> Oh i love it!The food is fab!Just got lunch there a few hours ago, mamamia!Salad was fresh and tasty. Same for pizza. Small portions though, but i think it s one of those places you pay more for quality of what you re eating than the quantity of it. I will definitely go back and explore that menu some more!> First time here --- great experience! The staff was so friendly and helpful. One spent time explaining how it worked and helped me get the right order while another one came to the seating area to check every customer and made the area tidy and clean. I liked the pizza I ordered. The crust was thin, the size was decent, and most important of all, it tasted really good. Highly recommended!Yesterday I found they offered breakfast sandwich. They used crispy pizza crusts as bread to make sandwiches. I ordered egg and cheese with additional veggies. The crust made it a great combination. I think it'll become one  my breakfast selections for a while.> Solid choice for some quick and easy pizza, yet with some high-quality ingredients! You can really tell that the ingredients are fresh and that the pizzas are made with a little more care and intention than other places. I got a half pie of the Dougie Pizza and found it to be really good compared other similar joints (such as Blaze). I love how thin and crunchy the pizza is and that their menu includes some delicious and unique combinations. It is true that Oath is pricier than most places and the serving size is on the smaller side (with the half pizza I felt fully satisfied yet felt like I could maybe have had more), but I think what you get in return is really high-quality artisan pizza which consequently tastes fresher and tastier.Plus, I have to say that the service at this particular location is very friendly! The cashier was very personable when I ordered and when we left, we were greeting with a warm goodbye from all of the employees. So all in all, you really can't go wrong here if you're looking for fresh, tasty, and friendly.","4, 3, 5, 5, 5"

The best I ever had.  I highly recommend Ruckus.  I ordered a couple of the extra  ingredients to go in the soup for an additional charge, and it was well worth it.> I had the Miso Lit Ramen, and tbh the cheesy name should have tipped me off. As you can see, I had less than half of it. The ground pork made the broth fatty-tasting and heavy -- not in a good, several-hour-broth kind of way, it was like I was sipping fat -- and it had little to no kick despite being labeled as spicy. It seemed like my friend had slightly better luck with her Tokyo Style Ramen, but we agreed this place wasn't worth coming back to anytime soon. Overall, this place was an unsatisfying bummer, though I hope they improve.> Cool atmosphere, I walked in and the hostess was very nice and friendly. I ordered the dope yolk and the salmon poke bowl. I was super excited about both of these and was pretty impressed by the portion of the poke bowl! It was flavorful and the green onions added a nice green freshness to the dish. Super disappointed when I realized that the dope yolk was missing the uni... I didn't realize until I left and was about to write this review, when i saw other pics of it. It was small portion of rice, egg yolk and tobiko. Super upsetting and don't know if they left out the uni on accident and feel like that is a crucial and rather important ingredient to leave out. Just kinda super irritated already left and paid. Just called - and they said they ran out of uni, that's why there wasn't any in my bowl. Well, if they knew they were out of the most expensive ingredient in the dish, they SHOULD have let me know when i ordered so i would have probably ordered something else and get that next time. Honestly, feel super gyped and hope they will give me extra uni next time i come in. Will update this review if this actually happens...> The best is the dope yolk but never come back again because the ramen and udon soupbase is so salty and deep flavor. Make me keep drinking water. Came here on friday for lunch, the place was empty.> Best place in Chinatown for food! Great twist on ramen!

Helped me get through the 5 hour flight.Now, the issue. How hard would it have been to wrap the burger in foil to keep it hot longer.Box was easy to handle but half filled with cold fries was a waste. A small  side something to easily eat on the plane would have worked. Could the ketchup packets be any smaller?Lesson learned.

But food is overpriced and bad. A better impossible burger can be had at Burger King. And those aren't especially good. This was served so cold, on dry stale bread, with no sauce, that I sent it back! They fired me a new one. Just as bad. So disappointing. Can't understand why one cannot serve hot food.

It's the same concept as hot pot, but the food is served on skewers and cooked according to the spicy level you choose. I have to say I don't have high spicy tolerance so one chili sign has already thrown me off the roof, I was sweating non stop... but even though it was painful, we enjoyed our food. The meat and veggies are super flavorful and the broth goes well with the steamed rice.The main courses and others appetizers are way spicier than the skewers. But still tasty.Def will come back!> Recent visits prove that the quality of food decrease dramatically. Pig feet with lots of uncleaned fur on the skin. It showed that the food was never washed or dealt properly. The ingredients in the dish were burnt as well which made the pig feet tasted bitter.I was even shocked they used chicken wings which had gone bad. The chicken wing dish tasted sour and fishy. The taste did not come from the ingredients. It came from the wings themselves. They definitely went bad and the restaurant still served them. I threw away the entire dish. What a shame. The rabbit dish was also full of gamy taste. It does not even close to the same type of authentic dish I have had in Szechuan province.Some authentic and nice dishes disappeared. i.e. duck intestine and so on.> The food is delicious. It's flavorful and delicious. For the spiciness level, we got the level 3 and that was perfect. We got nine skewers for the two of us - cauliflower, two types of mushroom, tofu skin, beef, fish, shrimp, lettuce, and quail eggs. It's a $1 per skewer so we guessed we weren't getting a whole lot per skewer but it's the combination of it all we look forward to. To give you an idea of the amount to expect per skewer:  three pieces of cauliflower, three quail eggs, two pieces of fish, three mushrooms, one piece of shrimp. We also got an order of the spicy dumplings, which were fried. The spicy dumplings were spicy and salty on the outside. Everything we ordered was delicious. We were about 70% full after eating everything. Next time, we may consider ordering a few more skewers and maybe another appetizer.We thought the service was good. Some reviewers say the service isn't that great but different cultures have different types of service. At this place, the service was speedy and hospitable. I know everyone's experience is different. We came here for a late lunch on a rainy Sunday for lunch. The staff happily us get our stroller with our sleeping toddler into the restaurant and a towel to dry the stroller. A different staff member took our order and then went on break. The last staff who helped us got us our check. Then she said in Mandarin that it was pouring heavily outside suddenly and that we are welcome to sit and stay inside for the rain to die down. That was really nice of her to offer that. We ended up deciding it was better to finish running errands while the toddler was still asleep so she held the door open as we got the stroller out. So we thought the service was attentive and nice - maybe it was less busy at that hour so the staff was more attentive or we got really lucky with the staff we interacted with.> Service - not that great, they treat you like you're part of the assembly line, just saying they could do much better. I had to ask for my own water after she had asked my friend Food - surprisingly good because almost every place I've tried that's affordable in Chinatown has been disappointing.  Definitely the place to go to get your sinus cleared with all these allergies around> Recent visit knocked down a few stars ):Hot and sour noodles were all sour--no heat. The noodles were not cooked long enough. Ordered Level 5 for the skewers and it wasn't spicy. Very very sad. Was so excited about this place.","4, 1, 4, 2, 5"

If you are looking for authentic Asian foods, you will be disappointed.If you are coming here with a large group, you should call beforehand to make a reservation to be safe. A group (6) of us came here around 6:30pm on a Friday night, and it was PACKED. Luckily we made a reservation beforehand. It's a place that is slightly more fancy than the casual eatery (like Panera), but not super high-end.Service was wonderful. The owner of the restaurant offered us Miso Soup on the house, which was really kind and generous of her! She also managed all of our drink orders efficiently. The 6 of us decided to split our bill 4-way, which might have been confusing for her, but she was very accommodating and brought out the bills accurately, with the tip already calculated for us! Overall, really happy with the friendly and courteous service we received.In terms of food, I am a picky critic when it comes to Asian food because I grew up with authentic Asian food. I had the Korean BBQ Galbi, which had a lot of beef short ribs with bones, bowl of rice, kimchi, and very little veggies. I will say the flavor of the beef short ribs was decent for an Asian-fusion dish, but it wasn't as authentic as the ""traditional Korean recipe"" stated in the menu. There was actually a decent amount of meat on the short ribs, also some ribs just came with bone. I wish they gave more rice with the dish. The flavors in the short ribs were very strong and it would have been nice to balance them out with the rice.APPETIZERS: Kimchi was DELICIOUS! Fresh and spicy. I really enjoyed it. The 6 of us ordered 2 separate sides of Kimchi to share, and it was worth it. Fries were ok, I wish they were a little more crispier, but it was fine.This was my second time here, which was a lot better than my first time. The reason why I am giving it 3-stars was because the food is OK-average or, depending on what you get, a little bit better than average in terms of authenticity and quality; it's also a little pricey, especially for Asian food in Boston. BUT, it's a good place to go for a group to chat if you're looking for an environment that is a little more fancy than Panera.> The name ""ginger exchange"" is pretty generic and isn't exclusive to a specific type of Asian cuisine. I appreciated the range of options in this pan-Asian friendly restaurant, but the food was subpar and overpriced.I ordered the sushi tower as an appetizer and I'm not sure why it's called a ""tower"" because it's essentially a deconstructed bibimbap or poke with very little fish/imitation crab. The waitress told us to mix everything together but didn't give us any utensils to do us until we asked. What a weird concept for something to be described as a ""sushi tower""? Aside from the odd aesthetics of its construction, there was no flavor in this dish and so I asked for a side of gochujang (red pepper paste) which instantly gave it some life--as one would do when eating bibimbap. Afterwards I got the Korean BBQ galbi bento box which came with a good amount of galbi, 4 piece roll (I believe it was spicy tuna), rice, edamame and a spring roll. The menu was really confusing because the sushi roll and appetizer were ""chef's choice""--like....ok.. the galbi was actually very good and tender.My friends and I came for a late dinner, so it wasn't very crowded, but not once did a waiter offer to bring us more water during the entire meal! We also had a bottle of soy sauce on the table that wasn't being used so a waiter came up and filled our already-filled soy sauce bowl with more soy sauce for no reason and then left with the bottle. I guess it was nice of him but it was also really weird and slightly uncomfortable in my opinion.If you're really desperate for food late at night, this would be a decent place, but if you have the time definitely check your other dining options before committing to this strange food establishment> Ginger Exchange Symphony is a short walk from the Symphony Station on the Green E Line.  I walked in and was immediately seated without a reservation, right next to a table occupied by a pair of diners.  Ah, no, can I sit over there instead one table over?  The next several parties to arrive were also similarly led to this table, now between me and the two diners, and asked to be seated elsewhere.It wasn't like the room was packed.  There were occupied tables scattered about, none beside another.  I don't know why the host was so set on occupying that particular table, when the best way to seat tables is to scatter them about so that two neighboring tables are not stuck with one another the entirety of both their meals.The table he had attempted to sit me right next to was happily chatting away.  Loud enough that I still heard every word from one table over.  And they outlasted me, so they would have been my neighbors my entire meal.  Not ideal for a stop for a quick and quiet meal before I headed off to my evening activities.After mulling over the menu and asking my server for her recommendation, I went with the Korean Beef Rice Dish $14.50 Tender slices of our Korean-style marinated beef served with wok-seared baby bok choyBased on a 2015 photo posted by Bonnie C, I'd say the portion of greens in the dish has shrunk considerably, as mine came with perhaps 2 and a half halved baby bok choy stalks.  They were crisp firm, rather than crisp tender.The beef was tender as advertised, however, the marinade wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  You say Korean beef, I think bulgogi, and this wasn't bulgogi.  It was okay, but I love bulgogi, and so this was not what I was exactly hoping for.  The portion was okay though, as I had some leftover to take home with me.Sounds interesting:Shrimp Tofu Poppers $7.95 (app)Sweet Garlic Udon Noodles (price depends on protein choice)Porky's Bao Bao (I wished they served a two bao appetizer portion)> I am outraged by this restaurant. I ordered a salmon SASHIMI bibimbap bowl. When it was delivered the salmon was cooked. That's not what sashimi is. I find cooked salmon disgusting so I can't even eat it. I guess I'll just be hungry tonight. en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/…I ordered through grubhub so I had to go through them to request a refund. The restaurant refused and said they were ""sorry"". Okay. No offer to send me something else that I can eat. I will NEVER consider eating from here again. If they don't actually know what sashimi is, what other questionable choices are they making in their kitchen? Disgusting.","4, 3, 2, 3, 1"

Food was great and service was awesome. The waiter was very nice> Ordered the surf and turf, Charlie As seafood combo (fettuccini), and the shrimp bianco - one in penne and the other in fettuccini, and ended with a slice of lemoncillo for dessert. The surf and turf came with three strips of beef that had a marinated/grilled barbecue flavor, very good and quite smoky. The shrimp in this dish was baked in butter and breadcrumbs which gave it a very unique and savory flavor. Great if you want a mix of seafood and meat!The shrimp bianco has a refreshing lemon and zesty flavor, with a generous amount of fresh shrimp. Definitely a favorite in the restaurant for a good reason. The seafood combo had a similar baked breaded haddock, and we ordered a pasta bolognese side (no meatballs) and this was also a very filling and delicious meal. The lemoncillo was tart, zest, and very flavorful. Great way to end a great meal. Luckily we found parking within two blocks of the restaurant, and reservations for weekend meals is recommended (it gets crowded with reservations for dinner). More on the pricey side for pastas, however the restaurant serves great quality seafood - fresh and well seasoned.> Last night I ordered from East Side for  the first time and it was great! I went with the Vodka Sauce Shrimp and Scallops over penne for my main dish and their homemade buffalo chicken tenders as an appetizer.The tenders were AMAZING. The chicken was fresh and perfectly cooked. The sauce had a goo of kick but also a hint of sweetness. Perfect Balance! They reminded me of the famed ""Puritan Backroom"" in NH. The main dish was good but left a little to be desired. Maybe my expectations were too high after the chicken. The penne itself was great but the sauce flavor was a little weak and the scallops/shrimp were a bit overcooked. I will definitely be coming back but next time I will try one of their more popular main dishes.> I ate there last night, and still cant stop thinking about the bolognese... it is family friendly with lots of kids there till about 7pm. If I was in town one more day, I'd go back and bring food with me on the plane home. I can't stress enough how delicious the bolognese was.> Let me start by saying that if I could zero stars as a rating, I would. In fact, if I could give a negative star rating, that would probably be the most accurate. Food was bland, beer was flat and the service was abysmal. After finishing our meal, we sat unattended to for close to 30 minutes, with dirty plates, as well as empty pizza trays and water glasses littering the table (there was not even a line to get into the restaurant at this point so i can't even blame the poor performance on any sort of 'rush'). When we were finally able to get an employee's attention we were met with a verbal attack, the likes of which I've never experienced in all my time dining out. A middle-aged man (or should I say, middle-aged bus boy), came to clear our plates and while doing so, began berating various members of our group, and even attempted to insight a physical altercation. We were bewildered at this sort of behavior, and upon expressing this to another employee, we were told he 'does this all the time...'

They have come a long way w/ all their stores & their menu (I loved their garlicky greens). Smoothies, grain bowls, etc. Change is good but at the same time they've missed the mark on certain things too. I have always appreciated their sense of buying local, it's important to be supporting farmers in the area. You see this on the board when you come in, where everything comes from (produce, dairy, bread). They have changed their veggie burger recipe several times & I guess since I haven't had it in such a long time I am not sure how it is anymore. Since there are always trends that come into play, the grain bowls are a thing right now. This place is busy, like really busy during lunch so be prepared. I have been a fan of the salads that they have over the years. What I don't understand is why they are now automatically giving me a stupid plastic cup of dressing instead of just adding it to the salad when they're making it. I find that to be super annoying. If I wanted to do all that work I would make a damn salad at home instead. This is also a huge waste, why are you creating more plastic in the world? You should be helping the environment, not adding to its demise.> Came here for lunch with two coworkers on Monday and I enjoyed my salad that I got (the spicy avocado and lime with chicken) but I felt like it had a lot of kale in it, way more than it should have (and so much so that I couldn't finish all the kale). I'd return for something quick and easy if I was in the area, but it wasn't anything amazing.> I came on a Friday around 4pm and ordered the Spicy Avocado & Lime Quinoa bowl. There was 1 other person waiting ahead of me, but between the time that I ordered and the time I got my food, 20 minutes had passed!! More than being impressed by the fresh, local ingredients, I walked away with astonishment at how slowly the kitchen operates. Thankfully, I wasn't in a rush, but avoid this location if you are! I can't even begin to imagine how frustrated people must get during the lunch rush. Overall, my bowl was simple and tasted pretty fresh. I wish they were a bit more generous with the avocado portions though! Come by for a healthy bite to eat, but do expect a long wait!> I've started with this restaurant when it first opened and the chain was new and exciting. Over the years and even until this very day the quality has steadily dropped to the point where it's really not even as competitive as other restaurants. I've eaten here over 200 times so I speak with experience Today we just blew 14 bucks for two vanilla shakes and they were terrible. The bowls and the breakfast offerings are mediocre. The restaurant is often messy and even dirty and it gets later on in the day> This is for customer service. walked in at ten minutes before closing and said I know you're about to close, just  get me whatever you can make quickly. The young woman mopping the floor came right over and said ""Please, order anything you want""...very genuine, no attitude, guy behind the counter was just as nice as he made me my fries and shake...wished me a warm good night.

He hooked me up with a veggie burger (the black bean one) and it was really good! This was my first experience with a veggie burger and I am glad that I came to Larry and his team for that!A few of my friends got the BBQ and weren't happy about the amount of meat on the ribs for the price they paid, but they were happy with the chicken they had.I would say if you come here, grab the veggie burger and some sides or grab some chicken- either way you'll be happy!A bit expensive, but I expect that in Seaport. Larry has to pay bills lol> I ordered food from Larry J's BBQ Cafe via an app, but then I realized it would be a while till I could sit down to eat, so I called in to see if they'd be willing to pack the fries separately in my Hillbilly Nacho appetizer (Fries, chili, pulled pork, cheese, jalapeno peppers) Half $7.95 before I headed on over.Larry J's is located in a building plopped in the middle of an urban greenspace with tables and chairs strewn about before it.  You order at the window out front, and await your order by the window to the side where you may also claim some paper napkins and sauce packets if you wish.The fellow who took my call let me know in a reasonable manner that this request of mine took more time than they can normally extend to each order, but that it was no trouble this time.  I appreciated that.Turns out they packed everything separately - the fries (as expected), the pulled pork in a pile, the chili in a soup cup, and the cheese in a sauce cup.  Wow.  I was imagining the pile of toppings layered up in a dish, with the fries separate.The pulled pork by itself was a bit dry in spots, but mingled with the chili, it was perfect.  This was a nice mess of a dish once put back together.Their sweet potato fries $2.95 small from their Teasers menu was a goodly portion, all soft (no crisp) but full of nice sweet potato flavor.> First of all, I'm from Texas so when the website mentioned Texas on there, I got a little excited. Let me tell you this is NOT Texas style bbq. I got the box combo and a side of Mac and cheese.The brisket was dry, the baked beans tasted like Bush's baked beans from the can and I cannot figure out their potato salad. The Mac and cheese was dry and hard but I think that's because of the bread crumbs. I ordered sliced bread on the side which I did not receive. Complimentary sliced bread on the side is traditionally served with Texas bbq. There was also no bbq sauce on the side (which should be automatically served with bbq right?). No extras were given such as onions, pickle slices or jalapeños either. I attached a picture of the meal that I received and the Texas style bbq I was expecting and that I'm used to.> Short takes: Would not recommend the burnt ends or mac. Brisket was OK. Nice location nearby a park.A large group of us ordered while in the area for a convention. I didn't look up the place prior so I went in open and ordered what I would usually get from a place such as this. The guy in front was nice and it appeared the workers liked being there. It took a while for the food.I personally got the Burnt Ends platter with mac and cheese/baked beans. Burnt ends were very different and not in a good way. The rub was heavier with a strong peppery (black peppercorn and something else) flavor and the fat wasn't as rendered as other places.  I wouldn't mind this if it had better flavors but it was also very chewy and slightly dry.  It was overall some small bits of meat on a very large piece of fat. The portion size was good though I wouldn't expect a smaller one for around 19 dollars.The mac was also different, also slightly dry. It could have used more cheese. The beans on other hand didn't have the issue of the mac/meat where they were almost too soft, lacking some texture. Sauce reminded me of a slightly stronger version of their BBQ sauce, a lot better than what they give out. I usually don't add BBQ sauce to good burnt ends or brisket but it was necessary to cut the pepper and heavy fat flavor. I found it alright though watery; definitely ketchup based. The meal was alright though I would not go back if I was around there. I also tried a bit of brisket from someone else which lacked a bit of smoke/texture but was overall fine. 2.3> Burnt ends 5 starsRibs 5 starsSpice sausage link 5 starsPotato salad wonderfulCole slaw wonderful.

Their other sandwiches are good too, but The Wilson tops them all. Quality ingredients, spicy, tangy flavor, 10/10.Little bit pricey at $15 for pickup or $20+ for delivery factoring in tip/fees but it's absolutely worth it. I go out of the way (1.2 mile walk from my apartment) to treat myself every now and then. Only other caveat I can think of is that it's messy AF. I wouldn't want to eat this on a first date -- it comes with plenty of napkins for a good reason. If you're prepared to tackle this beast of a sandwich you won't be disappointed.> First time stopping in after driving by many times.$13 for a club sandwich. I was expecting something large and delicious at that price. What I got was a relatively small club sandwich, with rubbery bacon, over-grilled bread that was hard to eat, and an herb mayo that was so overly-potent, it also made it hard to eat. All this in a sandwich so small, it would probably cost $7 next town over. Oh but don't forget the thimble full of direct-from-a-box coleslaw it comes with.I was not impressed.> This was our second time ordering from All Star, having ordered from there about a year previously. The first time we ordered the Gobbler, Mr. Miyagi, and Chili Cheese Fries. It wasn't super memorable, but I didn't remember hating it so we decided to order again. Both times we ordered for delivery which is available through DoorDash. The prices are $1-$3 higher per item, as well as fee DD charges, so it's definitely much more expensive to do this. Our food took about 35 minutes to arrive. I ordered the Atomic Meatloaf Meltdown and got the sauce on the side. I dipped my sandwich in it and found it WAY too spicy for me, so I'm glad I got it on the side. Otherwise it tasted pretty bland and wasn't much to write home about especially for $15. WE also got the Friday special of a Fish Po'Boy that was alright. The fish was clearly fresh and served on a baguette. It was decent but nothing special. And again, for $15 wasn't worth it. It also comes with a mustard sauce (not tartar sauce) that I enjoyed. The chili cheese onions rings were good, but I feel like these should be eaten at the restaurant. Sitting in their container they just got all soggy and greasy from the chili. The chili was a little spicy but I liked the chunks of beef in it. Overall, I probably won't go back. The food was alright but it's so expensive for not a lot of food. Maybe if I were int he area my experience would be better at the restaurant, but I won't go out of my way to order from them again.> This is not just any sandwich bar it is an all star place to eat. All kidding aside, the ingredients tasted fresh, with no detail seemingly left out. There are some unusual combos with fun names. Then there are some regular sandwiches, that do not have regular flavor, the food selections are above average. The only thing that I did not like was the cookie, but it still tasted fine. It was more biscuit like than gooey cookie. The rest rooms are gender neutral and clean. On street parking is available, but during peak times not always plentiful.> This is a sibling restaurant of All stars pizza joint across the street. This restaurant offers a huge selection of sandwich/burgers...and you are bounded to find something you like there for sure (if not, just build your own!).I had a chance to try their specialty burger and it was so huge that I ended up having the same burger + fries over my next few meals..and the good thing was..it was still very tasty after reheating it up, too.The price isn't cheap by any means..but I wouldn't say they were expensive either..esp given a large portion size. Try on if you are in the area. It's a casual place to grab lunch/dinner...and I think based on the people who stopped by there...most of their orders were for to gos...so chances are you we'll be able to find some seats to enjoy you meal if you want to find some placed to sit and relax, too.","5, 2, 3, 5, 4"

I don't think I've had a seafood plate like that in Boston thus far. Definitely recommend!All the desserts are to die for. Tried the cannolis, cheesecake, and tiramisu cup. All unique and definitely well made.Service here was excellent. There's a quaint bar on the first floor but dining on the second floor with a quiet dim ambiance.Overall some of the best Italian food I've had in tHe North End and in Boston.> As someone who has become spoiled with homemade Italian meals, it's hard to admit that a restaurant can feel like your charming grandmas house where the food is almost as good.I stopped in her purely by process of elimination. After seeing all the long waits for the popular restaurants in the north end, my family and I stumbled upon Ciao Bella, and boy were we glad we did!The restaurant's atmosphere is very cozy, spacious, and nice. The waiting staff was very friendly (unlike the rude wait staff at Carmelina's) and attentive. The wine selection was delicious and the food was well prepared and tasty.I am giving Ciao Bella a 4 star, not 5, because it simply is not the BEST Italian restaurant in Boston. Regardless of the fact, I would recommend that anyone try them out instead of falling victim to what seems to be the tourist traps of the main road. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service.> Yummmmmm. My daughter lives nearby so we went for dinner. Party of 4. We sat at the bar for a drink and decided to stay for dinner. I sent my pasta back because it was undercooked, but no one else in the party complained. I will say that I do not like my pasta ""Al dente"". Other than that it was excellent. I would definitely go back. Drinks were excellent. Bartenders were perfect. Drinks were spot on.> Really good place. Nice interior, nice staff, and yummy food. Check them out on a Tuesday for cheap date night.. good deal on bottle of wine, app to share, two entrees, and a dessert to share for $49. Small menu to choose from for date night, wish it was bigger but I suppose beggars can't be choosers> What do you get if you challenge 10 randomly selected Lyft drivers, 5 CVS employees, and 1 person waiting for a water taxi to create a trendy, pop-up Italian restaurant in 3 hours with a grocery budget of $50? Ciao Bella! Let me just say that whatever was going on at Ciao Bella last night would make great reality TV. I'd give it 3 months before Kitchen Nightmares comes calling.Really, I could forgive the amusing confusion and endearing chaos of the front-of-the-house staff if the food had been good. But it was quite the opposite: week-old Prego a la microwave, chicken marsala cup o'noodles. And two sad little anchovies swimming in Hidden Valley. It was a real kick in the face when the bill arrived and we'd spent more on this dishwater meal than at any other restaurant we've ever eaten at in the North End.I live in Boston and like to try new restaurants. Normally Eater is spot-on with their recommendations, but in this case, it's a cold hard PASS.","5, 4, 4, 4, 1"

My husband and I spent our evening there to mark our anniversary celebration. I was apprehensive about trying Reelhouse since I had never been and read mixed reviews. But boy was I blown away by the impeccable service, the amazingly unique and flavorful menu, and even our bartender, Erica, were exceptional. Being wine connoisseurs, we were very specific with our wine ""taste's and distaste's,"" but she was knowledgeable with her grapes, vineyards, and regions and knew exactly hot to steer us toward complete pallet bliss! I have a plenitude of food allergies and dining out is always quite the experience! But the waitstaff and chef were so accommodating and made substitutions that were so robust with spices and flavors that I wondered if my ""altered-dinner"" was better then the actual menu item. I would highly recommend ReelHouse Boston. A ""reel"" treat for the food enthusiasts! Thanks for help making our anniversary so special!> Unfortunately a little disappointed and maybe would have preferred eating here as a lunch or brunch instead of a dinner. As an app I had the calamari which was served with marinara--when I asked for tartar sauce they sadly didn't have any. The calamari itself was what I would expect from a burger joint rather than an seafood restaurant, but still tasted okay. For mains I tried the BCC (I think that's what it was called) and the baked whitefish dish on the seasonal summer dinner menu. The food overall was good and the flavors in the sauces were nice. The baked fish mentioned that it came with mussels on the menu, which were nowhere to be found on the plate. When I asked the waiter about them, he wasn't sure at first and then got back to us letting us know that the muscles were ground up and put in the sauce... The BCC was a pot of various shellfish and had a good flavor overall! I wish the bread had been served on the side instead of in the broth because it got really soggy.> The shrimp cocktail is good, but not much else. Ordered a vodka cranberry which tasted like nothing of the sort. Told the bartender and she pushed the drink back and said that's just how it is. She also didn't give my friend their change back after taking their order, assuming the rest was her tip LOL Horrible experience. The food is super bland too. The additional star is for the unbeatable waterfront view. Wouldn't be a bad drinking spot if the service and drinks were better.> tl;dr: All out the outdoor seating on a nice day.Great view and ambience from the outside seating. Service was friendly. Food was good, but only good and a bit pricey. I didn't find the cocktail menu very inspiring and wine list was short. But still pleased with the experience on a beautiful summer evening.> Great view. That's it. Over priced drinks and sad food. Our Malaysian Style Chicken Wings were over cooked and dry. The $17 Kobe beef and Foies Gras dumplings are simply hideous. Not sure what the chef was planning with this dish but it definitely didn't work.","5, 3, 2, 4, 3"

I went here with a few friends and all of us ordered appetizers and main course. Veggie Fried dumplings were good, they had an unexpected texture which I didn't love though others liked it. But the main course was very tasty and the portions were a good size. We ordered drunken noodles, mongo curry and veggie noodles.Its a nice small restaurant to grab a weekday (or weekend) dinner.> Glad there are two Thai Dish's, since the one near us closed.We love the Duck curry lunch here! Tender duck in a flavorful, creamy sauce, at a super reasonable price for duck. I prefer the duck curry to the mango curry w duck myself, but go w mango if you like slightly more sweet and mango-yTofu/massaman is great too, though it's difficult for us to choose this over the wonderful duck curries.Sauces are high quality, clearly made with care and each sauce tastes unique.And service is so fast + attentive, too. Great lunch spot.> I love coming here for weekday lunch. There are usually plenty of empty tables, but that's not to say they're unpopular. They have a very busy delivery service. Here's what I've gotten:Spicy chicken with green beans - excellent, freshly cooked, and the green beans retain their crunchiness, perfect spice level. Green curry with chicken- again large portion, not very spicy though, left feeling full.Service is quick and prices are good.> They make the best and most comforting green curry I've had in a long time. The restaurant has a very comfortable environment, the people who work there are nice, and I appreciate that they also do takeout.> Great lunch specials. Never a long wait for pick-up. Can't speak for their delivery service as they are located literally right behind my apartment building, but they have never quoted me longer than 15 minutes even for large orders.Favorites include Pad See-Ew (try it with duck!), Pad Khee-Mao (5/5 spiciness is the way to go), and the Thai Dish fried rice. But honestly, you can't go wrong with any of their duck dishes. I tend to not order any of their curries, however, because I feel like there are better to be had at other Thai places in town.

And we were pleasantly surprised. The food came out very hot, very tasty, and relatively quick. I can't remember the names of everything we got. So I'll just add pictures along with this review. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat with some good vegetarian options definitely consider this place. The only reason I reviewed it four out of five stars was because I wasn't super impressed with the flavors but it was still good.> Spectacularly marginal and underwhelming. We walked past the restaurant and it smelled good and there were a lot of people- a good sign. We, a party of 5, sat down and ordered. As soon as dishes started to arrive, we all started looking at each other with questioning eyes. ""These are the worst Crab Rangoon I've ever had... anywhere,"" said my daughter. And she was right. Everything else was marginal. Not terrible, but not anything worth recommending. We didn't feel compelled to take pictures of our food- an oddity in our family.Oh, and then, the waitress seemed offended that I asked for the cash discount that was posted on signs all over the restaurant. And then she pressed for a larger tip even though I left a little more than 15%. We'll pass on this one next time.> TLDR: great lunch special Came here for lunch with a friend and had a great time. The inside is well lit, clean, and friendly.  We were seated quickly and ended up getting the fish filet in Szechuan sauce, beef with long horn peppers and fried green beans. Food came out quickly and was delicious. It's definitely spicy so be aware but absolutely delicious. Great value for the money and great for a quick meal.> Given that there's a handful of Chinese restaurants in this area (I mean they don't call it Chinatown for no reason lol), I would say that this place gets the job done. They cover all of your favorite staple chinese dishes and have quick and easy service so you are in and out of there without any hassle. My friends and I ordered sesame chicken and house fried rice, which were both good. However, while this place is just like many of the restaurants in the area, this place does stand out in one aspect: customer service....and NOT in a good way. My friend had requested that the sesame chicken sauce be put on the side just because she personally doesn't like the chicken to get too soggy. And while I get her request is a little bit of an unconventional one, it still does not justify the waitress giving us a rude look and totally judging us as she replied "".... yeah you know that's not how it works right?..."" Her objection was subtle yet it left us a bit peeved to say the least. We got our way after some insistence, but we were disappointed with the way the waitress had handled the request. Surely this might be the fault of one individual person, but with so many similar restaurant nearby I don't have the strongest of desires to come back here :(> After eating nothing but seafood for a week, we just wanted some old fashioned Chinese food. And Chinatown never fails to let anyone down, well not completely. We came across this place by accident. It had the items we were both craving so figured why not, lets give it a go.  The inside is nothing to write home about but thats everywhere on that side of town. Place was clean though and there were open tables so no complaints!We started with the crab rangoons and what should have also been the potstickers, but we'll get to that in a minute.  The rangoons for the price werent bad at all, definitely get moneys worth.  The waitress forgot our potstickers. Halfway through our meal we asked another lady if they were coming and she said they weren't on the ticket. Another 10 minutes went by and we saw our waitress who said they were coming. The came about 20 minutes into the meal. So that was a bit if a dissapointment as by then, we had already eaten almost everything else and it was more an afterthought at that point.I had the General Tso's chicken and the sauce I will say was so overly delicious it was memorable, but the chicken was so deep friend and overcooked that I could only each maybe half the pieces of it without having to spit out because it was so chewy and tough. Shame because that sauce was soooo good and it had potential but deep friend chicken thats way overdone is just impossble to chew and swallow. The Walnut shrimp though was another dish we had and it was superb. The flavor wasn't too sweet and the portion was insanely large. It was our favorite by far.Honestly, if you want your standard chinese food, this place is worth wandering into. Don't expect bells and whistles but overall the portion for the price was there and they have enough options to where you can find what you're looking for.I did want to free the poor giant fish in their lobster and crab tanks. Not gonna lie that was depressing as it couldnt even move but I guess someone will eat it but still, let that fish swim at least it's last week of life!","4, 2, 5, 3, 3"

Therefore, I am extremely picky with my Thai food. I am also not a vegan but my friend is and this is one of her favorite spots. After observing the menu,  I ordered the Golden Triangles to share and then went with something a little more than the classic Pad Thai...I ordered the Veggie Beef Pad See Ew and my date ordered the chicken version. I usually like my Thai food, ""Thai Hot,"" but that day, I just wanted noodles. I was extremely impressed with the flavor and taste of the dish. I didn't know how the veggie meat was going to taste, but I was surprised on how much it taste like the original dish. I can't believe it was Vegan!The only thing I could say that can improve was the attention from service. I drink a lot of water, so I need my drink refilled often and I never got a refill. I also was going to order dessert, but the server brought the check before I could ask.> To be clear, I absolutely adore this place and have come 10+ times over the past several years. That said, the food is a hit or miss, and you really have to know what to get. The service is also not great and the staff mostly doesn't speak English, though they are usually pretty kind (it's a family run restaurant). The entrance/stairs to the restaurant are sketchy, but the interior is cozy with strings of lights and lots of plants. The 3-star review is mostly because of 2 things: I went today, and portions were WAY smaller than usual. When I tried to ask staff about it, they didn't understand me, and didn't bother to try finding someone to translate. The second thing: the bubble tea has consistently had really hard bubbles. They used to be so chewy and soft, but they stopped cooking them properly. The reason I love this place though is one dish: the pad kee mao with veggie chicken. I haven't had any better, even with the smaller portions. The fried eggplant is so delicious, and the dish is just so savory and fragrant overall with the fresh basil and spicy sauce. The half pineapple dish is also really good and well worth the money (please actually eat the pineapple bowl though by scraping it out lol).Overall, still a decent place. I just hope the smaller portions were a one-time thing.> I was in the Tufts area and decided to come here with a friend for the lunchtime special. My Thai Vegan Cafe has about ten options to choose from for lunch time offerings. I chose the Pad See Ew which came with soup, hot tea, and the choice of a fried spring roll or a fried dumpling. I've never had a vegan style fried dumpling before so I chose that and was not disappointed! The food was good here. It was above average and the portions were large and memorable. The ambiance was spacious here with high ceilings and plenty of tables. If I am ever in the area, I would definitely bring my husband or family here for a quick bite. The word vegan always scares off people but Thai food here tasted like Thai food I have enjoyed at other establishments. There was nothing irregular about the food here if anything it tasted better!> Came back after 2 years - service is still lackluster, and the food next door at Cuong's Vegan is the same if not very similar for lunch. Literally saw the same soup and curry that I ordered. Got the mango curry with tofu this time - lunch special. Food came out in 3 minutes, but everything was undercooked. There were big pieces of green onions in the dish, and I also had to ask for the cup of jasmine tea that was supposed to be included in the lunch special.  Flavors were okay, but not great enough to come back.> I want to give this place five stars but the service is SO bad. When it's busy, it's a struggle to place your order. Even when it's dead, good luck getting refills or getting the check in a reasonable time. Also, on my most recent visit, my fork was dirty, the plates were chipped, and there was a gnat pestering me. Last, My Thai Vegan Cafe isn't receptive to splitting checks. *Ugh*But the food is good if you can look past all this. The boba tea is meh and the spiciness levels are hit or miss, but the tamarind duck ($17) and spring rolls are amazing. My friends rave about the pad kee mao plus ($9.25). I'm a fan of the basil chicken but even though the menu lists it as spicy (like 3 chili peppers hot), the two times I've ordered it the spice level was non-existent. It was still good though!YELP'S 2019 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #17","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

I loved the food and the service! We had a whole grilled fish and it was magic! I 100% recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fresh food.> DINNER REVIEWTo date, one of my most memorable and exceptional dining experiences in Boston. This place is an absolute must-try, for the food, the setting, and the overall dining experience.I had read about Field & Vine somewhere so it had made it on my restaurant list so when I was looking for restaurants nearby Bow Market (where we happened to be in the evening), I thought we should try Field & Vine.This place is tucked in an alley among some other popular Somerville restaurants/bars like the independent.SETTING: When you walk in, you are overwhelmed by the greenery and nature in the dining room. The entire front window has potted plants and there are branches above the entire bar seating area which looks right onto the kitchen. If you get the chance, sit at the bar to watch the chefs in action.FOOD: We were seated immediately (2 on Saturday at 7PM, mind you, but it was still busy) and were greeted by one of the most unique menus I had ever seen. It wasn't too big (it only had 4 categories: Raw bar, Snacks, Vegetables, Not Vegetables) but every single dish had several elements that really intrigued me. Some had za'atar and others had Marcona almonds, and others had house fermented hot sauce. Each element had an intention which we really appreciated. And upon talking to the waitress, we learned that the menu changes often based on what's fresh and in season locally. We, of course, LOVED that and couldn't wait for the meal. Though the menu does change, it tends to stay relatively consistent within a given season so if you go in the summer, maybe you'll find some similar dishes to what we ordered:Spiced nuts - these were spiced with Old Bay and lemon, both of which we love. They were a nice snack to kick off the meal. Focaccia with lemon-garlic-tahini - some of the doughiest cubes of focaccia I've ever had with some delicious tahini. These are a must-order!Shishito Peppers - perfectly blistered peppers over a yuzu aioli. We were fighting over the last pepper.Baby Tat Soi - as evidence of the ever-changing menu, the waitress said that the day prior to the day we dined there, this was bok choy (with the same preparation). Tat soi is quite similar to bok choy but a little leafier. This was probably our favorite dish, it came atop cashew butter, smoked onion, and gochujang vinaigrette, three unique and delicious elements. It felt like the tat soi was the canvas for these strokes of culinary genius.Brisket Lettuce Wraps - what would happen if my Jewish grandmother teamed up with an Asian grandmother. I immediately thought of my grandmother's brisket when I saw this brisket but the lettuce wraps with the fermented hot sauce gave it an Asian spin. Definitely recommend this as well.I would 100% recommend you make a plan to go to Field & Vine ASAP to enjoy this amazing restaurant. I can't wait to go back to try some other things on the menu.> My mother and I stopped in here when i was taking a flight out of Logan, unfortunately my flight that night was canceled but the service and food was great!!My mom chose this place because it said there was parking but in all honesty, there were only about three spots for guests and the rest were for permit holders. Luckily there were metered spots nearby. We didn't have reservations but they were able to accommodate us and we were grateful. Our server, Kristina was very patient with us as I was on the phone to Southwest for a while but she gave us space and made sure our waters remained filled. She also provided us with great recommendations. Since this is a small plate place, they recommend about 2-3 dishes per person but be ready because some of the dishes are quite are quite hearty so you may not need that many. For my mother and I, we started with the bread and spread and that bread was soooo yummy and warm!!! Then we shared a beet salad and squash blossoms - both were amazing! We could have (and should have) stopped there but we ordered two more plates - a pork and a fish dish and both were great! We ended with a dessert because it sounded too good to pass on but in all honesty, we should have done salads and desert and that is it. My mom lives nearby so she will definitely be back!!> I had a great experience at Field and Vine. Very quick and friendly staff. The seating is limited, so definitely make a reservation.The scallop tostada was by far my favorite! Very fresh and light. I did not like the Roasted Mushrooms we order though. I thought the mole sauce it came with had a very odd after taste, my date liked it though. The cast iron pork should cornbread was a little overly sweet for an entree and didn't have much pork shoulder, but was still pretty good!They seem to pretty regularly change their menu, so I'll definitely be back!> It isn't often I get to Somerville anymore but was taking my daughter to Logan and decided to try this based on reviews.  They weren't wrong.  GPS had a little trouble finding it but we did and lucked out with a parking spot right there.It is mainly tapas. We started with the focaccia which was excellent. Then we ordered the tomato & watermelon salad (5 stars)grilled squash blossoms, seared green bean, burrata and grilled shrimp & cabbage.  Everything was good.As was the service.  Cudos to chef and owners.","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

I am sold!I was scrolling through my Uber eats one day planning to order lunch and NANI? Chick'n Bunz popped up on the front page. With the whole Popeyes vs Chik Fil A chicken sandwich, it really got me craving for some chicken sandwiches. I immediately clicked in to browse through the menu. This is a pop up shop that is part of Love Art Udon. For the sandwich, you get to customize your sandwich. You get 1 of 3 choices of a pillowy, sweet, flaky bun (Hokkaido, matcha, or brown sugar), then for the protein/""inside"" you can choose from chicken, shrimp, spam, sweet potato, and finally the flavor; classic, okonomi, and Korean-style. I ordered the Okonomi chicken sandwich with Hokkaido bun. It was super delicious! The chicken was super crispy and juicy! It comes with the yakisoba sauce and Japanese mayo and a side of slaw. The buns were super decadent, soft and pillowy. The pictures of the sandwich on Uber eats look quite small but it was actually pretty hefty!!! I was pretty stuffed and satisfied afterwards.> A delivery-only (via Ubereats) enigma, NANI?! Chick'n is straight out of your wildest dreams. Set up out of Love Art Udon's kitchen, NANI?! has a range of fried chicken, spam, sweet potato, and shrimp sandwiches, nestled on sweet Hokkaido buns. The hype is worth it and I've never ordered on Ubereats before, but it made sense just to try this sandwich. I got the K-style crispy chicken just on the classic Hokkaido bun. The burgers are delivered in fully enclosed bags, to keep the heat insulated, and on trays that really help keep the sandwiches presentable. They come each with 1 sauce and coleslaw on the side. I don't actually think the sauce is necessary since the sandwich is super flavorful already. The K-Crispy comes with kimchi and pickled vegetables on top of the chicken-already flavors that pack a lot of punch. If anything, the saltiness of the chicken could be dialed down a bit with all that's going on, on top. But the chicken was super crispy and every bite was amazing, really well breaded and fried. The sweet bread was fluffy and thick and had enough body to keep everything together; even with all my toppings, nothing leaked/broke apart due to the structural integrity of the bread - MVP of the sandwich for sure. The nice bit of sweetness too from the buns was a good finishing touch and added to the flavors. Would definitely order again, going to recommend this literally hidden gem.","4, 4"

On my first Boston trip, I was obsessed with their malted cold brew and Potato/egg/rosemary breakfast bagel. Since moving to the area, I've had time to come study here every few weeks. And honestly, I'm not impressed. The cold brew is just as bitter and..not smooth. Tastes similar to Starbucks which is just bad coffee. The malted version tastes no better. The last time I came I had a Chai Latte which tasted just like milk with a light peppering of spice. No thank you. If I wanted to spend $5 on an overpriced drink, I'll go somewhere where it tastes good. The upside to this place is the ample study space. Lots of outlets, lots of tables.> Really cute coffee shop in the back bay (: I'm not local to Boston and was only in town for a conference, but I found this place on Yelp.  Their delicious malt iced coffee is what attracted me to this place because it showed that they have unique drink options.  I got there at around 8am on a Saturday, there were already a few people in the store but it wasn't too busy.  However, during the half hour I spent there a steady flow of people came in and out of the shop, many staying, many obviously returning customers.  It was so obvious that the workers formed close relationships with the local patrons and that many people frequently visited the coffee shop as part of their daily routine.  I ended up getting an Americano because I wasn't feeling a sweet drink, and they were happy to help me customize my order.  There are also plenty of food options.  There is outdoor and indoor seating including some indoor seating in a very pretty enclosed patio.  If I lived in the back bay, this would definitely be my go to coffee shop","5, 5, 5, 3, 5"

This is literally on a random street in Somerville so I had no idea what to expect since it's not like Somerville or Boston in general is known for Pakistani food. But man this place blew my mind. Very little seating and a card minimum of 25 might throw you off but trust me it is worth it. We got 2 chickeb kebabs, 1 beef nihari, a garlic naan and rice.Chicken Kebabs- juicy, super flavorful, near perfect. Better than any kebabs from any other desi place I've been to in Boston. Beef Nihari- a very labor intensive dish, I was really surprised to see it on their menu. My mom makes her Bangladeshi style nihari only at the end of Ramadan so being able to eat it not during Ramadan is a huge treat for me. Suuuuuuper tender beef, basically fell apart with the side of my fork. Spicy base. Also gets a perfect score from me.Garlic Naan- You can literally see them slap the naan together and roll the garlic into it and stick it into the tandoor yourself. This puts all the other naan in Boston to shame. Loaded with garlic. I'm salivating thinking about it.Rice- HUGE portion of rice, we could have ordered twice the items and wouldn't have ran out of rice. PLEASE check this place out, they deserve it.> This restaurant is probably the best example of worst service. I was visiting Boston last weekend and we had ordered food to go from this place. The person who had taken our ordered jumbled our order and gave us wrong order. We had ordered chicken tikka and there was no chicken tikka in the food order that came, and gave us Chicken Karahi . We called the restaurant to let them know, and remove that item from our bill. But the person behind the phone argued with us and told us we never ordered chicken tikka in the first place. We also ordered Garlic NaN but they gave butter nan and charged us for Garlic NaN.This is not the first time it has happened to us. They did the same thing a couple of months ago, we ignored it as we thought they would have mixed it. The problem is not just the wrong food, but the restaurant's denial and arrogant behavior.Also, the food that came was ice cold and inedible. Stay away from this one.> Heard a lot about this so we decided to try kebabs. Half the items were not available so taking out one star.We ordered:Chicken kebab- it was okay, that's why one starChicken tikka kebab- we didn't get this order. The owner gave chicken Karahi instead. The chicken was very cold as well. And when we called to inform them of the missing item, he was rude and didn't even apologize for once and instead turn it on us. Mutton karahi- very oilyGarlic naan - first they gave some other naan. Then we waited for 15 minutes more to get the garlic naanMango lassi- they didn't have it. The owner insisted on trying a mango juice for free. That was kind of him but we really didn't want to try anything else. Giving one star for that.Taking out one star for messing up our orderTaking out one star for being extremely rude and unapologetic. Why will we order chicken and mutton karahi together!! Also even if we had ordered that why was the chicken so cold in ten karahi!!!!!!I don't think they care if they lose customers.> Was craving Pakistani biryani one night and this place seemed to check off everything on my 'must haves' list. Legit, good, flavorful Pakistani place! Tucked away in one of the side streets of sommerville, the place is quite the gem. They do take phone orders, so if you know what you want you can order ahead and just pick up.They don't deliver, but I was told doordash does pick ups (haven't tried that myself yet). It's not a real sit in restaurant, with only two tables.but they also serve as a mini convenience store for Pakistani/Indian items/spices/dry grocery- very reasonably priced! Food: massive portions and very good! 3/5, definitely recommended, the amount and quality is worth your dollar! Comes with raita (free)I also got the chicken kebabs (these are seekh kabab)- AMAZING! 5/5 and again reasonably priced.Can't wait to go try their chicken/lamb curries as my sixth sense says (based on the food I had) that it would be great!> Suuuuch flavorful food! Butter chicken is a little runny, but definitely very tasty & garlic naan is to die for!!! Super garlicky and soft. Tandoori Chicken tikka is very  tasty. Chicken tikka wrap is unique and delicious (the chicken tikka wrapped in naan with yogurt sauce, onions, lettuce, tomato) The star of the show is the chicken kebab!!! Ground chicken mixed with garlic onions peppers and spices and cooked in tandoor as a kebab.Beware of the location though, its a small shop that used to be a convenience store. Never made a full transition to a restaurant lol. One table and a few chairs for dine-in option. Not friendly staff at all--but the food is worth all these negatives","5, 1, 1, 4, 4"

Glad I stopped in but will look elsewhere next time.> Ordered their paglia e fieno which was an egg and spinach fettecine coated in a nice creamy sauce. Dish also had pancetta, peas, and mushrooms. Simple but pretty tasty. Pasta was cooked perfectly and prices were pretty standard for Italian. I know other people in my party were not impressed with their dishes, but from my dish alone, I felt pretty content with my meal.> We had a decent lunch here while visiting Boston last Sunday. The food was overpriced ($11 for a watered down Bellini that was listed at $9.50 on the menu, but went up in price when the bill arrived). Still the food had good flavor, and was perfectly portioned - it's an authentic little place. The venue was dark inside, but staff members were friendly. We were the only customers that afternoon during our visit and we received adequate service. I would have left a 3 star review, but I was very disappointed when the charge from this meal posted to my credit card and I discovered that the server adjusted her tip to be more than I provided. I cannot recommend this restaurant due to the dishonesty component. Sad because the food was good.","5, 2, 3, 4, 1"

I started with The kale salad which was very good. The dressing on it was amazing. For the main course I choose the Gnocchi. I was surprised by how big the portion was it was very hearty and filling. Other then the chard, which now i know i am not a fan of, it was the perfect dish. Lastly, for the dessert I got the cheesecake which was incredible. It wasn't your traditional cheesecake, but man I could come back just for that. The service was top notch and when I had a question about a dish they didn't give me any sass and was happy to answer it. No idea why there are so many bad reviews this place is great. Even though it was way over my price range on a normal night, I will be back for a special occasion.> Started with the amazing New England Chowda! Whole clam included! Chorizo, celery, chives, fresh thyme and tender little necks. Perfect! Then I went with a cheat and enjoyed the handcut Pasta Bolognese. Out of this world! I cleaned my plate with the bread so well that no dishwasher was needed! I don't know what the lousy reviews are about. Bring in an attitude get an attitude, I guess. I was treated stellar thanks to my server, Faith. She was very kind and prompt.> I stayed at The Liberty over the weekend. I had not planned on eating at Clink, but since we were there, we decided to give it a try. I ordered a cheeseburger, thinking that at $21.00 and being at a reputable place, the burger would be delish. I was expecting a handmade patty topped with a nice cheddar,  ripe tomato, and bib lettuce. I was served a mediocre, pre-made patty,  topped with arugula and an underripe piece of tomato. My boyfriend's chicken dish was not much better. I am not saying Clink's food is bad, but with so many good restaurants in Boston, Clink is kind of a waste of time.> Clink or stink?  My bf and I went here for Valentine's Day. We got brunch the next day at CLINK. Our waitress was 100% not attentive and did not care to even ask how our meals were. I asked a nice bus boy for a water refill. She forgot everything and didn't even pre bus our table meaning setting up condiments before our meals arrived. The Bloody Mary my bf ordered was filled to the rim and she not ONCE asked if there was an issue. To make matters worse after she forgot my bread and dropped the check (with a brand new happy personality, of course) she never even left a Pen. Won't be going to clink again. She was the woman in the turban. I wish I could have tipped out the busser than her. She did nothing at all. Horrible experience. Horrible waitress. Food was just OKAY. Wasn't going in expecting much we were just checking out and we're hungry. She was horrible.

The schezwan fried rice had huge chunks of smelly chicken. The chicken gravy dish was disappointing too. Asked for it spicy but they dumped every Chili at hand in that dish. The chicken fried rice was terrible, also had huge chunks of the disgusting skin on chicken.It looks like they cook a whole bunch of chicken and throw it into everything. Disappointing meal.> Ordered the Leechitini (Martini) it was pretty good. Not too many customers where there and service was a bit slow...> The food itself is not bad; however, it's not good to that point to wait forever. I was so close to leave, and then my food finally came. My order was just chicken biryani, chicken tikka marsala and two appetizers. Nothing too special for an Indiana restaurant, but I waited for more than half an hour! It happened to me three years ago. I guess it was not an accident. They are just simply slow. And what more ridiculous was the waitress came twice to ask if I was still working on my food while she could absolutely see I WAS still eating!! What's the rush for?? If you want customers to leave early to increase the turn over rate, then bring the food fast. Will not come back in another three years!> TLDR: where else can you get Indo Chinese? Nice little Indian place along mass ave. Prices are fairly comparable to other Indian restaurants. Menu has all your favorites like garlic naan, but you also get slightly more hard to get favorites like chicken Manchurian and other Indo Chinese foods.

You're in the mood for breakfast, but you think you're only option is lunch. I settled on pizza. I start heading to 'Same Old Place'. As I'm walking I look to my right and see a bright pink sign 'Little Dipper'. The logo has a diner look to it.. and Diners typically serve breakfast. As I'm standing in the doorway of 'SOP', I research Little Dipper. I see serving breakfast all day for Friday. I immediately head to Little Dipper. When you open the door, there are large red curtains that you need to separate with your hands making you feel like you're stepping into the past. The hostess, very kind, immediately greets me and I get to choose where I want to sit. I sit in a nook near the window experiencing both the present and the past. At this point, I feel like I'm coming back simply because of the ambiance and great service! Before leaving to get me a menu, she asks is the music is too loud. That's when I realize I'm listening to ""You can't hurry love"". I order the classic orange juice, short stack, and the Little Dipper (2 eggs any style, toast and home fries). The pancakes: nostalgic. Toast: a bit more crunchy than I normally eat it, but it was oddly satisfying. The eggs perfectly over medium, and the home fries are browned to perfection and served with onions! The cutest thing - the kids drink comes in that small glass milk bottle from back then. Loved it! Every moment.Server: Emily (5-start service: she came over. Initiated convo.. and checked in a few times. But never invasive.Until next time,Your friendly pescatarian> I came to this little gem after seeing some photos of it on Instagram. It's extremely small and cute, and on the new side as they opened in 2018. Talk about a great location too. I came in for brunch on a Monday early afternoon so we were one of a few tables there. Our server was kind and prompt. I got the eggs Benedict but subbed spinach for the ham, which they were more than happy to do. My counterpart got the major tom breakfast sandwich. Both came with potatoes. We also ordered 2 of the available  donuts that day, a Boston cream and a glazed. Both of our dishes were solid for the most part. The potatoes were cooked beautifully but just had no seasoning at all which was a disappointment. Salt, pepper, hot sauce, and ketchup still couldn't help the incredibly plain potatoes. The English muffins they use are definitely a step above a regular English muffin and it showed. They used their own chipotle sauce instead of a traditional hollandaise which I did find to be extremely heavy, but still tasty. The donuts were both tasty and a good size, the Boston cream being better than the glazed. I would just be a bit weary about ordering a soda here, we ordered a ginger ale and it ended up being an all natural very hipster ginger ale that came in a bottle (definitely no free refills, if that's something you're used to) and was $4. At the end when we received the check we were very confused to see a ""KAF 3.75%"" charge. A quick google revealed that this is a Kitchen Appreciation Fee, which I have never heard of in my life. Once we actually found out what it was I was more than on board to  pay for it, as long as it truly goes to the kitchens wages as is claimed. It may be helpful for the waiter in the future to point out the charge and explain it, may avoid some confusion or conflict. Overall I would return! So cute and they frequently have new things.> Been living in JP for a bit and really wanted to try this place! Every time I walk by it's fairly busy and I love the space theme. We made the mistake of trying to get a table on Saturday morning and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table. To be fair, she did estimate it would be half an hour and they were friendly about adding us to the list and giving us a call when ready. When we finally got our table, the service was quick and friendly. I got the Ground Control (which was just a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and avocado). I would give my plate a 4/5 because the bread of the sandwich was kind of dense and dry and I couldn't really pick it up and eat it. But once I picked up my fork the dish was delicious and the home fries were SO crispy that I honestly wanted to order another side of it. My friends kept stealing more, just for reference of how amazing the potatoes were. One of my friends got the huevos rancheros, absolutely delicious, the one and only small critique it that the tortilla got pretty soggy underneath everything else. The other dish we got was the pumpkin French toast which was absolutely delicious if you are the type of person that has a sweet tooth for breakfast. I definitely didn't not have any room for one of their delicious looking pastries, but will be back to try one for sure.> I had the pleasure of dining in this little neighborhood gem,  I actually  walked past it a few times  and never  really paid it to much attention until,  I  decided to see what was local, I  have my regular go to spot  that  NEVER fails and this would be the 2nd  new place I tried  this weekend,  and since  it was local  why not, Well,  I  was pleasantly surprised and  although I wish they had more options the breakfast wasn't bad, , I will definitely go back the pancakes were good and the homefries were cooked well, I like mines with a little more onions,  I got just  a side and 2 eggs, with cheese,  I  wanted cheddar cheese, I  got American..however the food was tasty  I will definitely go back to try something else.> Really good home style breakfast with a themed twist. It was a last minute breakfast option that was 8 minutes away. We were definitely glad we came here and will mostly come again. The space theme was awesome with all the model rockets hanging from the ceiling. I was expecting my breakfast to be average at the least but it exceeded my expectations completely. I got an omelette and added a pancake that was dusted with sugar. Delicious!! With be back for more breakfasts! , just watch out for parking in the area it could get a little tricky.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

I always go for the steak with yellow rice. This is a mom and pop restaurant and the food is made with love. The prices are beyond reasonable and the flavor is spot on.

It isn't large so seating it fairly limited but you can always take out.Food: 5Customer service: 5> Ok let me just say I'm from NYC and raised byMy Puerto Rican mom who cooks authentic Spanish food. If your expecting something like this you will not be disappointed. Had the pernil and chicharrons with yellow rice and beans and I can truthfully say I was pleased with meal. Not only that put the food Came out hot and fresh after you place order with counter person as there is no waiter service. A Latino cuisine that's not watered down highly recommended. I give it 4 out of 5 Coques.> Mmmm very homey. I could tell Everyone who came in was from the area . The lady who  took my order was nice .. small seating area glade I grabbed a seat when I did . Keep in mind this is a Mom and pop the building won't be spike and span little run down but that gives it flavor. The food was delicious  I'm so Mad I order only 1 chicken empanada to go and ate it in  1 minute.... (buy more than  1 ! ) I Ate the stewed chicken and rice con tostones did not disappoint. Chicken had perfect flavor .> Puertorrican food just blocks from my home...horrible news for my non-existent diet! I was excited to learn this place was nearby and finally got to try it out this week. Sadly the food was great so guess I'll have to keep coming back when I want some food to remind me of my childhood days.I had the fried pork with fried plantains. Both were freshly prepared right after I ordered. The food was delicious and tasted just as good as the versions of that dish I've eaten in Puerto Rico and in Florida. The prices were very affordable and that's without taking into account how expensive this city is. The staff was super nice and there were plenty of regular customers eating in. I took my food to-go and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes.> I was recommended to stop by here for lunch for a patty and I'm glad I did!

Chefs at the grill are nice guys and way talented, please remember their tip jar - very well deserved! Edit: Upgraded to 5 stars because Management cares and is making this right. Thank you, Kacee!> I've been going to fire and ice since I was little. The food has always been very tasty however over the weekend I decided to go with my family. I do not think I will be back. I had received many emails that they were renovating the place... yet it honestly may look worse than before. Upon walking in the place is just run down, handprints all over the windows on the doors, dust on the floor/stairs leading up to the grill area. The upstairs looked a lot more open / lighter than it used to be as it used to have a darker ambiance. The tables looked old and put together maybe as a place holder in waiting for new furniture? The finish on the floor was extremely slippery, and it wasn't even wet.Moving on to the buffet - the glass fixtures above the food were lowered making it pretty difficult to get your food in a sanitary way (especially the noodles). It didn't appear that anyone who worked there had maybe tested this out and saw that it wasn't efficient. In addition, I picked up two silver bowls that were dirty before finally grabbing a clean one. The countertops of the buffet were not wiped down, some guy had his small child standing on the buffet as he filled his bowl and no one said anything..At the end of the buffet near the new sauce section there was a bunch of bowls half filled that seemed to be left by customers and no one cleaned up. The sauces were moved to the buffet section and the area was not well-kept. The spice section had its own area and was a complete mess. I just felt pretty dirty after being in there. It's sad because the food is very good but I don't think I can bring myself back in. I would definitely work on sanitation, and maybe not have reopened until the place looked better.> More than disappointed...disgusted.  The place is completely disorganized...was moved 3 times in the first 15 minutes.  Table was dirty and damaged.  Bathrooms were disgystiAppetizers were inedible and the main bbq food was less than average for the price (over $$120 for 3 people).  Couldn't find my waiter.  I just felt embarrassed for them.  I will never return and will tell everyone I know to avoid it.  After reading other reviews I don't now how they stay in business. Update:  it was nice of fire and ice management to reach out to me after I wrote this review.  We had a short conversation but I had such a bad experience I told them to keep the money and invest it in the restaurant.> Very disappointing. I had expectation of sophisticated food implied by name of the restaurant. Food turned out merely random, unexciting stir fried stuff. Waiting was bad. We were told to wait another 15min even though we arrived on time for reservation. 25min later we were finally seated. Other servicing was fine.> First time here and we were definitely pleased. It's not your average spot. I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a rush to eat or if you have lots of trouble deciding what time eat. Though there are plenty of items and tastes to choose from. We went during Brunch and truly was pleased with the options. They made pancakes, omelets and crepes fresh on the grill with any toppings or stuffings that you like. Truly with creativity you can definitely make a great dish. There is rice, noodles, pasta or salad you can use to create a base for your meal. There is a great selection of meat, toppings and sauces to add. Once done you stand around the grill awaiting it to be cooked. Everything is made to order right in front of you. Once done your creation is plated and bon appetit. You are the creator of your own delicious dish. The service was great and the prices were reasonable. When in Boston I definitely recommend stopping by for a great meal and experience.","5, 2, 1, 1, 2"

I am a Northeastern student, and I had passed by this place for years, always wanting to try it. I was deciding between the naanizza and the naanini, but they were out of the naanizza so that made the decision for me. And what a great decision it was! A big piece of naan filled with rice if you want, saucy chicken tikka, and then topped with whatever toppings you want! I elected for lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and cucumber, as well as lime juice, cilantro, and a dash of chaat masala for flavor. Then, I got to choose sauces; I asked how many I get to pick and was told I could choose as many as I wanted. I love when a place doesn't limit toppings and sauces! So, I chose 4 sauces, which may be an abomination to most, but to me, is an explosion of flavor: tamarind, mint yogurt, garlic chili, and hot mango. Then, they go and grill it in a panini press; yum! All the flavors together work super well. Don't come seeking traditional Indian food, but for fast fusion, this place works really well.> Really good chicken tikka pizza ($10) and super mangoey mango lassi ($2.50). The naanizza had a good crust to hold the thick sauce and large deliciously marinated chicken chunks. The pani puri ($6.99) were interesting but it was my first time trying this. The shells were crunchy and surprisingly could hold many spoonfuls of the sauce provided. The filling is described as ""tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion or chickpeas"" but it felt more like a cold blend or potato and chickpeas.I like this fast casual Indian food concept. Though service is hit or miss with some of the men working there the food is good. I ordered online for pickup and it took about 15-20 minutes. Highly recommend if you want chicken tikka pizza and a mango lassi.> If you're looking for quick, affordable, and healthy Indian food- this is your place! At first I was confused upon walking in because the restaurant shares the same lobby as  a Subway. I was greeted immediately and was told how to order. You can choose from a wrap, bowl, or Nanini. I opted for a bowl with the halal curry chicken. At first I was not sure how curry chicken would taste with salad but all the flavors ended up coming together nicely. I like that there is an option of brown rice. I chose all my vegetables and asked for sauces on the side (2 max). I chose the tamarind and the raita (yogurt). The portion is plentiful and lasted 2 meals for me. The chicken was tender and everything was delicious.I am giving 3 stars because we tried to visit the restaurant on another day during stated business hours on the door however it was closed. There was no sign stating why they were closed. It is really inconvenient for people who come from far away, find parking just to eat at the restaurant, and find that it is closed.> Moheesh (probably not even his real name), a super defensive employee, blamed the customer for ordering Samosa chaat with description that is clearly for vegetable dumplings, as shown in their own website. Told me that it was my fault for not calling even though there is no option to call in the menu. Keep on arguing with customer, Piss POOR Customer service and refused to fix their own faulty mistake... will never frequent this place ever again.> Stopped for a quick bite before hopping on the T. This restaurant is steps from the Symphony station which is just what I needed on a rainy, blustery day. It's definitely fast food, and you can't go in expecting gourmet quality food or you will be disappointed, but for a quick, easy, and relatively healthy option this place is great! I got a lamb curry bowl with mint sauce. The curry was a little spicier than I anticipated, but it warmed me right up! I like that you can customize the bowl with veggies and sauces that you like","5, 4, 3, 1, 4"

We dined in the main seating area upstairs. The restaurant was relatively quiet while we were there. There were two tables next to us with a party of 4 and 6, but the rest of the 2nd floor was quite empty. I've dined here countless times over the years, and each time the food and service has been consistent, which I appreciate. The ambience is dark and warm with the wood tones. The staff is friendly and efficient.For appetizers, we order the full sized seafood tower ($90) and crab cake. The seafood tower had 12 oysters total (3 types), 6 little neck clams, 6 shrimp cocktails, a tuna tartare, and this time, some smoked fish pate (I believe salmon?). The seafood was nice and fresh. However I felt the fish pate wasn't very flavorful and felt like a downgrade from the seafood tower I ordered many times in the past, which had crab claws instead. Hopefully those crab claws could be reincorporated into the seafood tower in the future. The crab cake seasoning was a delicious charred lemon aiol and I loved that it had a touch of grapefruit. It was garnished with baby arugula The meat wasn't over-floured and I could taste the crab meat. My only comment is that the portion was smaller than expected.For entrees, we order the 2 lbs beer steamed lobster, halibut, and filet mignon. Lobster was garnished with some cilantro and came with a side condiment of melted butter and grilled lemon. Highly recommend.Halibut was pan roasted and it came with a parmesan-roasted cauliflower. The meat was on the dryer side, but the flavor was good. The filet mignon was simply prepared with salt & pepper corns with a side condiment of brandy cream. Temperature was a little over. We ordered medium, but it was more of a medium well. Finally for dessert, we ordered the dark chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse, peanut cocoa nib brittle. Rich bittersweet chocolate with more of a fudge like consistency with crunchy bits within. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Overall, I'm a fan of Post390. It's been around for at least 10 years now, and the flavors are there. There is complexity in the dishes in the right places and the presentation is well put together. Maybe some technical details could be tweaked a little occasionally, but we had an enjoyable dinner!> Went for dinner with a group of 6 on Sunday night. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The waitress was attentive when getting drink and food orders.I got an old fashioned to start. They didn't have my old fashioned go-tos of Buffalo Trace or Four Roses, but the waitress recommended a different bourbon and I enjoyed it.Shared a half dozen oysters and started with a baked potato (like a weirdo). The oysters were nice and briny - just how I like them. The potato was also good. I asked for everything on the side as it came with chives, sour cream bacon and cheese sauce. I'm pretty simple when it comes to baked potatoes, so I just used butter. The outside was nicely salted, so that's all I needed.For dinner, I had the poke bowl off of the tavern menu. It wasn't super authentic (I took out all the nuts), but the fish was fresh and the rice cooked well. It was a good serving, especially because I had just eaten most of a potato.Almost everyone liked their food, but there was a problem with one of the steaks. The waitress did warn two of my group that there wasn't much of a certain kind of steak yet, so it would be cooked medium instead of medium rare. One steak was medium well, so it was sent back and waitress took it off the bill and gave another steak for free. What great customer service! I wouldn't have expected that, but she apologized and got a different steak out as soon as possible.This is a nice restaurant with good food and good service. Prices are to be expected for the area and quality. I would return.> I called multiple times trying to arrange a reservation for 10 people.Got someone on the phone once who referred me to the Event Manager (Jamie) as the # was too high for their usual system. Jamie was not available, but I was told to email, which I did.  Never received an answer. Called again and left a message, again, no answer, no call back.Ended up doing a private dinner elsewhere with 14 people, so there's that.I do a fair amount of events and private dining events, so this place is off my list now with that lack of communicating.Update:An update where an update is due. Anyone looking at my history can see that I rarely leave one star reviews....it's not my thing unless something really irks me immensely and trying to organize an event for what ended up being 14 people and waiting on responses clearly did irk me :)THAT being said: The Team at  Himmel Hospitality clearly  are on top of their social media. I appreciate the explanation and follow up that things fell through the cracks despite different channels and efforts to get in touch.  These things do happen unfortunately. That communication most certainly is more reflective of what we all hope for!> Good place for business lunches. Always has space available and food is quite good. Usually just order salads here. Nice to add some protein on top. Usually go for salmon but the steak tips are quite nice as well. Has the calamari and oysters as well. Pretty standard, good but nothing necessarily stands out about them in Boston.> To be clear we came for drinks. But we came back twice as the bar service was excellent!.I was in town for a work related activity and had the chance to socialize with colleagues and friends developed over many years.After day long sessions and working dinners many of us took the opportunity to gather at the end of the evening. We were looking for good Bourbon choices, a good wine pour and a setting that allowed us to gather and talk.We found all three! Best was the bar staff, friendly knowledgeable and even busy they found time to connect and offer friendly insights to the bar choices.We enjoyed ourselves one evening, we came back another, and some folks came back for lunch.I know I have it booked marked to return for a dinner event. Looking forward to it.","4, 4, 1, 4, 5"

We had minimal wait time before our seating, and our waitress was super nice and efficient. They did their best to create a nice little oasis in the middle of a transportation center, and the food was generously portioned and the beer was very cold and sudsy.  I had their clam chowder and my girlfriend had their beef chili, both were just right in a cold afternoon after returning from a trip in the Caribbean.> Came here while waiting for my train. Surrounded by places serving crêpes and McDonalds, I was pleased to find this mini bar situated next to the board with train times.For a train station tavern, I found it to be a overall decent experience. Sipping a seasonal Samuel Adams draft, the Winter Olympics on the TV and wooden seating really created a cool winter feel. I was disappointed to find that most of the drinks I was looking to try on the seasonal menu weren't available. Combined with the pricy food options ($13 for nachos), beers and game watching is probably the way to go. For a spot in the train station to kill time, probably your best option.> If you aren't into the SportsBall stuff, one of the monitors is just a view of the Big Monitor with the train times. That's what I was there for.Beer is overpriced. But hey, try going to many other Union Station-like places throughout the US and even find something resembling a bar. So 3 stars just for existing.> Loves these guys!! So many great beer choices and service is always prompt and very friendly. I come here all the time after work to grab a beer before I catch my train home and they're awesome. Jess and Tim are great, stop by if you get the chance!> Quick! A crowded mini bar with good options for someone waiting for their next bus or train. I had the chicken quesadilla that was pretty good I couldn't really see the shredded chicken it was kind a mush. The clam chowder wasn't good for it to be in Boston. The waitress who was very nice offered me the tomato soup which was soooo salty. The wings were good crunchy and perfectly seasoned.","4, 3, 3, 5, 3"

They have $1 for 4 wings and $5 margaritas (or $6 if frozen, which is a slushie consistency).Pro tip: the Thirsty Thursday menu only lists frozen strawberry margs but according to our waitress, they can technically make any of the flavors frozen! Just ask them :)I came with 3 friends after work, at around 7:45pm. The line was pretty long (about an hour wait) to be seated indoors, but my friends and I decided to eat outside since there was no wait for that. It was around 40°F probably, so not too bad, although my hands were frozen by the end of the meal.I ordered 4 teriyaki, 4 honey bbq, and 4 buffalo, as well as a strawberry margarita. The wings came out pretty fast. 12 wings was the perfect amount to fill me up. My favorite flavor was the buffalo. The margarita was sweet and fruity, just the way I like my drinks.I highly recommend coming for Thirsty Thursday! Such a great deal and everything was so good.> Eyes, Eyes,Eyes ! This review is dedicated to the wonderful sparkling shiniest Greenish eyes I had ever seen, the food was great, but having the opportunity to see a Waitress with such amazing eyes surely lighted up my day. Her eyes were radiant with so much inner light, Greenish going into yellowish, it was a very unique color and shine in her eyes. I told my brother and he told her. I admire the beauty in all, from an artistic point of view, I can see and recognize amazing beauty and colors around me. This lady eyes are like a dream come true kind of, such magical eyes !The food: Was great of course, my brother picked this place for breakfast and the two days we visited was excellent food and service. I really didn't know someone could mix Mimosa and Coffee, well, my brother does that and much more, talk about one on one family time. The things one learn about family.The outdoor seating is great, I liked the way the bar is situated and the seats in the indoor part of the restaurant. This is definitely a lovely place to eat and one of my brother's top favorite.> Thornton's never disappoints!!! We've been here many many times, both for brunch/lunch and dinner. Been here for a few Wednesday night Trivia nights which are a lot of fun. (Have never won though ;). I've had the turkey burger a few times which I really liked, also had the fish sandwich which was good. Most recently went for Saturday brunch and had the french toast which was soooo good. Crispy on the outside, soft on inside. Was a lot to finish so took it home and ate it the next day - so yummy. I'm drooling now thinking of it.  Hubs had the belgian waffle with strawberries which was good too. Our server was really great. She forgot the oven browns we had ordered but promptly rushed to get it. I think they must have hurried with them because they were a bit undercooked unlike how they usually are.This is a very popular place and rightly so!! Has a comfortable neighborhoody vibe, food is great, prices are good and outdoor seating in the summer is amazing. Keep it up Thornton's :)> One of the servers spilled hot coffee down my back and didn't even apologize or come back after it to say anything about it. Terrible service other than that too.> Thornton's used to be my go to place but recently the quality has gone down hill. I found two hairs in my food and the oil reside from the fries is brown, it's hard to miss. Clearly they don't change the fryer oil.","4, 4, 5, 4, 4"

The chicken was extremely tasty and didn't need sauce to be eaten. I was more disappointed in the 2 sides. The salad and fries were only okay. We also ordered the Shy Lady drink which was delicious.This place is new so I think the my have more tweaking to do but I enjoyed it. I wish they had more sand which options for dinner.> Review based off of dine in and food.This place honestly felt like a hen house. I was here for lunch on a Wednesday and the place was chaotic. The entrance itself is strange and you find yourself navigating through the restaurant to get to the ""front"". There was no real host desk so we were awkwardly standing in the restaurant until I flagged down a server. She then stated it was a seat yourself and first come first serve. We all looked each other with a big ""OH"" and made our way to an open table. Once we were seated we saw waiters bringing out food so we assumed we'd get a waiter for our table. We were all talking for about 15 minutes when we realized no one had come over yet. Again we flagged down a waiter and asked to order. She politely stated you have to order yourself and then we bring it to you. Another big ""OHHH"" but longer this time. Jeez okay so we've now waisted about 20 minutes because there's no signage or proactive directions from servers to help. When we were told it was a seat yourself that felt like it was probably the right time to say it's also order yourself. It chewed up a good portion of our lunch hour and just felt like it was something they should still be communicating to patrons since the restaurant is fairly new.The food itself was mediocre. My two co-workers got the lunch chicken plate and said it didn't have much flavor. I got the cauliflower sandwich and it was okay. I'm comparing it to State Park's cauliflower sandwich and that's a pretty high standard. Overall it was a bit of a lackluster experience and I think it's more convenient for those who work down in that area to dine here. We are on the other end of Kendall Square but I don't think we'll be missing this place.> 3.9Nothing to boast of but a perfectly reasonable meal to eat in the area. Wasn't a fan of the sauces but the chicken didn't need anything.> Came for lunch on a Friday night. It's an interesting place. You're supposed to walk in and seat yourself, which makes it feel like a self service restaurant. Although you have to wait for someone to bring you water and glasses. Then, you can order at the counter or possibly just grab one of the employees walking by to take your order (it's a little unclear as to which of the two is preferred). It's nice that you have the option of paying right away so you don't have to wait for a check to leave.On to the food. I shared a combo chicken for two, which came with a whole chicken, an arugula salad, and a side (we picked fries). The fries and arugula salad were great, however the chicken was kinda disappointing. The bird is quite small for the price. It's about the minimum size to feed a pair of people, but compared to a $6 rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, it's small. It's also a bit dry, although the sauce can help alleviate that.> Came on a weekend so I was handed a brunch menu upon entering. It's an order at the front then seat yourself kinda place. Since the Kendall area isn't really busy on weekends it was easy to find an open table after ordering. I went with the lunch plate which consisted of rotisserie chicken and I swapped the salad for their rosemary pepper fries. While they have several sauces, they were not needed as the chicken is flavorful on its own. The fries were well seasoned and freshly fried so overall I think this is a good option for a simple meal.","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

It is one of the more affordable joints around Longwood and the food here is healthier than that at the NRB by a long shot. The paninis (just under 7 bucks) are a good bet - I recommend the roast beef panini for its generous servings of meat and perfectly melted cheese. The breads used for the paninis are also very fresh and grilled just nice. The ingredients are of high quality and well worth the price.The soups are also relatively good, although at times, the vegetables in them might get so overcooked to the point of looking withered. Service is always prompt, friendly and courteous, which is great (especially when tips are not required)!> I've been working at BWH for almost 5 years now and before this cafe opened up I would walk down the street to the Longwood Galleria foodcourt. This place is much more convenient, being downstairs from my office and all. Sandwiches are great, never really tried their wraps so I can't say much. Service is nice and they always greet with a smile.","5, 2, 4, 5, 5"
Clover Food Lab,Boston,4.5,Null,No,Yes,No,cloverfoodlab.com,"American (New), Cafes, Sandwiches",Closed,Closed,Closed,Null,Closed,Null,Closed,Null,Null,"I absolutely adore Clover! They use locally sourced fresh ingredients and food that you can feel great about eating. The atmosphere is cozy and sunny inside with a large communal table for everyone to enjoy. I had a Chickpea Fritter sandwich which is served on pita that is made at Clover! On the sandwich comes hummus made with organic chickpeas from Connecticut, falafel balls, fresh cucumber tomato salad, pickled veggies, and tahini sauce. It was so tasty and so filling. I brought half of it home. I also had an order of the rosemary fries and they were phenomenal. The perfect amount of seasoning and crisp to really satisfy you.I really love that they provide all their nutrition and ingredient information on their website, too! Super helpful for people with dietary restrictions, or just those who want to be more conscious of what they're eating.> Excellent first experience at Clover!This review should be taken with a grain of salt as we went in the first few weeks of this location opening and not during the busy lunch hour (we went around 11:45). That said, it was an amazing experience and is reflective of the care and intention puts into their experience.I show up slightly before my friend and I am greeted by a beautiful interior that is graced by a ton of natural light (this is obviously affected by the time of day you go in), a beautiful light fixture with hanging bulbs, and a long-custom made wooden table which is the main seating area for the restaurant. I'm then greeted by 2 smiling humans who eagerly engaged me to talk about the menu. They answered all my questions and used the dynamic menu functionality where they can choose to display the ingredients of whatever you want on the menu depending on what you ask about. That's something I've never seen anywhere else.The menu is vegetarian (but you probably already knew that) and it's not too big which makes it manageable to order off of. They recommended the Chickpea fritter sandwich as a first-timer and I made it a platter with the beluga lentils and roasted carrots (definitely make it a platter because you can still make your own sandwich. The chickpeas were crispy and well-spiced and the fixins' that it comes with (hummus, hot sauce, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage) were plentiful and delicious. I also got a side of the Roman Tomato soup and I'm not a tomato soup guy but this was GOOD. The pita that it comes with is perfect for dipping in it too.I should also mention - the food came out quickly as well so this will be another one of my go-tos on Boylston along with Cava, Chipotle, and Dig Inn.> First time trying Clover. This spot is new so I am sure they are still figuring things out. Was greeted by two individuals who were there to help/take orders. There is also a self serve station. I got the egg/eggplant sandwich - this sandwich looks smaller than what is really packed in to it - boiled egg, fried eggplant, tomato/cucumber salad in a pita. It was delicious and filling. There is a prepackaged section if you are in a hurry and want to grab and go. Place was not packed but did have to wait a bit for the sandwich. Large communal table if you want to sit and eat. Overall great experience.> Some of the food is very good. Some is not. But portions are small and prices are high. Go to Dig Inn instead. Excellent quality and much better value. Update: Clover sent me a canned message. This is my response:The sunchoke platter was a mixed bag. The sunchoke / mushroom dish was excellent but could have been warmer. The side dishes in the platter were ok but not great. The salad had two issues. 1. The lettuce looked very wilted, old and brown on the edges. 2. The kale just didn't work. These two dishes cost just under $20 and the portions are very small. Compared to Digg Inn your prices are high, portions are small, and food quality of the recipes is less. In general, every time I go to Clover I always feel it has promise but then fails to deliver.> S, xx, des ss. ,ssse x e w.ws essdes rseee see ese We,srssseseeeeee.

HIGHLY recommend going here!> So I came here on a food tour, I did not have the classic dining experience so bear that in mind while digesting this review.The Boston food tour in which we participated was very heavy on the mama mia, Italian cuisine. This was actually the first stop so we were hungry and ready to shovel some carbs with seasoning into our pie holes. We were able to sample three of their pasta dishes: spaghetti amatriciana, penne putanesca, and gemelli with broccoli rabe (NOT on menu after thorough research). The gemelli with brocc was my FAVE. I love pasta seeping with oil with some wilted greens (nutritional value) and parm. The pasta was al dente and simmering. The penne putanesca was good, which isn't surprising given it is a BOMB sauce. I would say their version is slightly salty but definitely a good choice if you're here and in the mood for the tomatoy/olivey goodness.I didn't get a chance to sample the amatriciana because it had pork in it but everyone else in the group lost their shit going back for it repeatedly. The pasta at this place was good but I'm not sure how it matches up with other pasta joints in the area.> While visiting Boston, we had to make a second trip to Little Italy. The food, atmosphere, and people make it so fun. After wandering around trying to find a place to eat that didn't have a crazy wait, we stumbled across Artu. To be honest, I was the most concerned and least interested in this place. Nothing on the menu stood out to me and they had terrible reviews on yelp compared to everything around us. The entryway makes this place look like a crowded nightmare. You walk in thru the bar area, which is very narrow and busy. It wasn't until the host waved to me in the back and I made my way thru that we realized that it was much larger and had ample dining space and not too loud. We started with an appetizer of calamari. The flavor was good but a bit over cooked. The sauce was more of a cocktail sauce, not bad but not what I'm used to with calamari. We ordered the Chicken Marsala, Penne Puttanesca, and the Fettuccine Norcina for our meals. The Puttanesca didn't come with any protein so he ordered a side of sausage. I didn't try the pasta but the sausage was delicious. The chicken Marsala didn't come with any sides, which would have been ok if it had said that. $19 seemed excessive for a chicken breast. It tasted heavenly though. I ordered the Norcina, which had ground pork and a mushroom cream sauce, with black truffle cheese. This dish exceeded all of my expectations.  I would eat it once a week if I could. Overall, the current ratings do not do this place justice. The food was good and the service was exceptional.> This was pretty much the ONLY place still serving food after a Sunday night Bruins game and I'm happy to have found it! Food was excellent! Roasted Brussel sprouts, pizza and spinach pizza were delicious! Paired it with a glass of red wine. Service was great too. Loved it here, will definitely be back!","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

A $200 dinner for 2 people can get me at least a 10-12 course omakase meal for 2 in the Greater Boston Area, but at Momi Nonmi, it was only enough for 5 small dishes. The 5 dishes we got here was about the same portion size, quality, ingredients, etc of 5 courses of a nice omakase meal, so we were still hungry at the end of the meal. We just didn't want to order anything else here. We came for the toro flight, but we also got the agedashi tofu with truffle, ""loco moco"" (rice, beef, gravy, and egg on a sizzling plate), (a very salty) cucumber seaweed salad, and ""raindrop"" dessert. The toro and tofu were specials not on the menu, and I think they change it once a week. The restaurant was relatively empty on a Monday night, but the waiter was very friendly. The chef also came out for some of the dishes, like grating the truffle, but it's not like service was amazingly spectacular. Again, I don't mind paying for ambiance, expensive ingredients, a cool dining experience, a highly coveted chef, quality, or something, but this was like paying extra for nothing.> over priced, not satisfying, disappointedMiso soup is good with strong flavorThe tuna don is and chirashi are too small- very expensive and not satisfying> Came here for a late Sunday brunch with the boyfriend! We got here at around 1pm and there were only 2 other parties there. Gotta keep this place on the DL before it blows up I guess. We (okay I) got the Bento box and my boyfriend got the special for the day, which was a Toro donburi. The bento box consisted of 9 small dishes, which is presently very aesthetically. Perfect for your photo needs. It's enough to fill you up. Not all of them were hits, since I don't like pickled veggies or cooked seaweed. But I did have a few favorites. The short rib stew was super flavorful and packed with meaty goodness. The mini toro rice bowl was also delicious and fresh. The cod was SOOO flavorful with crisp skin, I could have eaten just this and been very pleased. They also included another stew with a fried shrimp which was fried to perfection. I ate it, tail and all. The toro rice bowl was also good. The fish was super flavorful and they gave quite a bit of it! It was exactly how they described, fresh fish and rice lol. That's it. It makes sense, but I thought it would come with something else I guess. However the star of the meal was definitely the bento because of the huge variety of dishes. This place is a little pricey for brunch. But if you consider that you're getting fresh fish for brunch, it evens out!> Momi Nonmi was certainly an unique experience. We came in for a Saturday lunch. The interior is cozy and intimate. Sitting at the bar meant we could chat to the servers as they came by. In general, the food felt very light, but certainly didn't leave us hungry. I ordered the bento box. It comes with 9 small portions of different items. It was a great chance to try a variety of options. I really liked the fish dishes. The tuna tartare for example was very tasty. However, I felt like the vegetable items were exceptional. They were very different than vegetable dishes that you find in other restaurants. I also tried the shaved spare ribs. The meat was savory and curiously sweet. The miso soup was interesting. It has a fish base which was almost overwhelming to everything else in the soup.Finally for dessert we tried the raindrop, which was very unique and I'd highly recommend trying it at least once.","5, 3, 1, 4, 5"

Ordered the sampler which came with spring rolls, dumplings, and fried chicken! All very tasty! The sauce on the fried chicken was delicious! The dumplings could've used a little more seasoning but were relatively good. Staff were very friendly and efficient! Would recommend and try again!> I've wanted to try the Moyzilla Food truck forever but never was able to make it work until today. My food truck dining partner and I took off on our lunch breaks to visit the truck near the Alewife station. We got there around 12:30 and it wasn't too busy. The wait was pretty long though. Not sure what happened as a man waiting said it never took this long. The wait probably seemed longer as it was raining but it was at least 15 minutes. For food we went with a variety. We got a spring roll (greasy), Japanese fried chicken (the winner, especially the spicy sauce), garlic noodles (okay), Asian slaw salad (very nice) and dumplings (way over cooked to the point they were blackened completely, yuck). I'd give the food 3.5 stars. Nothing special. I can see the appeal if you're working in the area and can run down to the truck for a quick meal but for me going out of my way to find it I really wanted a bit better service and quality. Price was just okay (a little expensive but they do take cards which is a bonus) and portions weren't that big (all of our items fit in the same box). I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't go out of my way again to find it.> While the dumplings were just ok, I saw other peoples dishes and they looked amazing. I found the dumplings that I ordered to be under-seasoned, frozen tasting, and lukewarm. I will definitely try again if I see them around, but it wasn't a great first impression. It was a little sad considering i'm a HUGE gyoza connoisseur.> My co-worker and I came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The service here is very speedy so you don't have to worry about cutting into your lunch time! :- ) I ordered the vegetable dumplings meal box which came with four pieces of dumplings, a choice of rice or garlic noodles, and a side of vegetable slaw. My total came out to be $9.63. The dumplings were yummy, perfectly fried, and not at all greasy! They were filled with diced edamame, carrots, and cabbage. I was hoping for more dumplings, though! The rice it came with was plain but paired very well with the dumpling dipping sauce. The vegetable slaw was dry and pretty bland. Overall, I don't think it was worth the price but I'm glad I got to try this place out!> Ordered the Japanese fried chicken lunch box ($9) from their Seaport pop-up. What I got was a solid, average meal. It did its job, but didn't leave a lasting impression. Fried chicken sort of tasted like the orange chicken from Panda Express without orange sauce. It came with a spicy mayo on top. The lunch also included Asian noodles which were somewhat bland. And Asian slaw, which was just ok. I think if I came back, I'd opt for the dumplings to see if those were better.","4, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Being local, there is quite the competition in the area. We wanted to try a new spot before the Celtics game and DAMN did we pick good.Cute, quaint little place away from the hustle and bussle of some of our other favs. When we arrived it was hot as hell in there, which was a little unsettling but that changed after we got our app. (Thank you for not sweating us out)The chicken soup was BOMB. SO much flavor and a huge portion! Definitely can be split between two people. My man got the chicken parm, and for me the chicken manga.OMG this dish was crack chicken rigatoni pasta with mushrooms and a delicious pink sauce. I am STILL drooling over this. So not good for the summer body but good for the winter body. See ya soon Lo Conte!> This restaurant is an absolute joke. I ordered $78 worth of food through Yelp / Grubhub and when I CALLED TO CONFIRM I was informed the ""service was turned off"" and that I can't order food from them? The 80$ charge already went through my bank account, what do you mean the service was turned off?The person on the phone I spoke to was extremely ride and unhelpful and told me they wouldn't make my food and that I would have to sit on the phone with Grub Hub to deal with this and get my money back. Literally the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I've also heard this restaurants food is bad in general with SO many better options in the North End. Don't give these people your business.> We were looking for a new spot to try in The North End and came across LoConte's.  From looking at the reviews, it seemed that a reservation would be necessary.  We made one for 5 p.m. on a Weekday.When we got there, it was apparent that no reservation was necessary at all that time of day.  There was only one other occupied table.  We got seated in a side room and got a table by the window.  The furniture is on the rickety side.  Still it was nice to have the room to ourselves for most of our meal.Our server was prompt and efficient.  We started with soft drinks.  Both of us had ginger ale.We liked that LoConte's has a section of old school Italian dishes.  It was from that section where we selected our meals.  We both started our meals with their house salad which consists of:  ""Fresh romaine lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, served with a side of our homemade creamy Italian dressing"".  This is a simple but flavorful salad.  The peppers were yellow ones and all the ingredients were fresh.We were give a bread basket which had real Italian bread in it.  The bread had a nice crust with a soft interior and had that nice, yeasty smell to it.For my main course, I chose ""Ravioli in a plum tomato sauce with fresh basil"".  I asked our server what was in the ravioli and he said ricotta.  This dish was great!  While I enjoyed it, I just couldn't finish it all.  It was one of those times where you wish you could bag up the leftovers, take them home and eat them the next day.My husband chose sausage cacciatore which consists of: ""Italian sausage cooked with green & red peppers, onions & mushrooms, served over fresh ziti or linguine"".  He said he chose penne but I think it was actually ziti.  This was a unique take on cacciatore.  He said that the sausages were sweet ones.  If he could have had his way, he said he would have had both sweet and hot sausage in it.  Still, he actually managed to eat all of his dinner, enjoying every bite of it.We were too full to order dessert.  I don't remember the exact amount that the meal costs but, before the tip, it cost around $70.  It's on the pricey side but we thought it was worth every penny!> We went to Loconte's Saturday at 4:30pm.  Lots of empty tables but we were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant next to another couple.  I asked if we could sit in one of the window tables or against the wall for more privacy and was told they were all reserved.  I didn't think I'd need a reservation at 4:30, but the hostess was rude and said I should know about Open Table.  The food was fine, but the experience not worth it.   We left at 5:45 and none of the ""reserved"" tables were filled yet.  We won't be going there again and wouldn't recommend it.> AMAZING FOOD!

My friends tried the eclair cream puff, green tea cream puff, and creme brûlée cream puff. They were balanced with the perfect mix of creamy, smooth center and soft, flaky outer layer. One of my friends said it had ""the texture of a cloud"". This ambiance is great as well. There is a row of seating (but it was completely empty when we got there) so we were comfortable. The place is bright and welcoming. You also get a free mini vanilla cream puff if you check in here!!! That was just enough if you're not a huge fan of sweets. They have a flavor of the month, as well as a HUGE selection of cream puffs. You can make your own too - all the ingredients are fresh and they make these to order. If you love cream puffs or dessert, you won't be disappointed. The only thing is be aware that the cream puffs are pretty expensive (about $4.50 each). However they are very filling. They also have mochi cream puffs, which looked INCREDIBLE and I would love to try them sometime!!!> I became a fan of Bear Papa's in NYC and was SOOO happy to find this on in Boston!  Fresh choux puffs, filled with various creams, what's not to like??I ordered the minis and chose vanilla cream, excellent!  There is also a check-in bonus on YELP for an additional mini.  Yes!I also sampled the honey butter while I was there, and it was fantastic.If you've never been to Beard Papa's, do yourself a favor and head on over!> A hole in the wall desserts place, Beard Papa's is a Japanese franchise specializing in cream puffs. I sampled the matcha, honey butter, and creme brulee. The pastry was light and airy, and the custard was rich and delicious. My favorites were the matcha and honey butter. Creme brûlée is a limited edition, but had a muted flavor. Seating is limited, so best to take your cream puffs to go. There were a lot different flavors, so I'll definitely be back for more.Tip: check in and get a free small vanilla puff!> If you haven't been to Beard's Papa, you must go!! It's fantastic. During the Corona virus scare, my friend and I were desperate to get our sweet tooth fix and our friend Jack was so gracious to help us satisfy our cream puff fixing. Not only did he offer us suggestions, he also gave us a good recommendation for cream puffs. Thank you thank you thank you!!> Lately I've been craving cream puffs, and the only place that really even does it is at Beard Papa's! And they REALLY DO IT. Today I got the Honey Butter Cream Puff and tried their new (well new to me LOL) Strawberry Cheesecake Eclair and it's soooo delicious and creamy in all the right places. I was hesitant at first because I was afraid that it would be way too sweet (as most cheesecake flavored items are), but it was PERFECT. And don't even mention their cream puff sandwiches with ice cream in the middle....that's the ideal snack/dessert for me here. I would have gotten it today but it's really cold outside so I got the Strawberry Cheesecake Eclair instead hehe no regrets","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"

I have yet to try their sandwiches so I'll definitely be back!> Cute little bakery/cafe with amazing variety of baked goods. We ordered the sticky bun, their most popular item and it did not disappoint. The caramelized pecans were crunchy and so delicious with the warm bun underneath, it was perfection with perfect mix of texture and flavor.The cafe itself is cute, small and can feel tight when it is full so I wouldn't come here to study but it's nice to hang out in the casual atmosphere. Service was quick and nice. Would want to come here to try the other goods !> As soon as we walked in, I got a whiff of warming, welcoming bacon scent. I am a stickler when it comes to bacon, but this did not smell like added fats or grease that you often get in diners or breakfast restaurants, just simple good old bacon like I haven't had in ages. That prompted me to order the smoked applewood sandwich, but in the salad version-I love that you can order any sandwich (except for paninis) in a salad version, since sometimes you just want to have those extra greens (you can still order a slice of bread on the side!). The bacon was perfectly crispy and flavourful. The winter special sandwich with curried tuna a creative, delicious treat, and the best fruit tart is here, perfectly light but satisfying, full of the most delicious fruity custard.> I came here for a quick dinner last night before rushing off to a meeting. I got there around 6:00 PM, and there wasn't much of a line, which was good. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich (with aged cheddar, cranberry chutney, apple-dill slaw, multigrain bread). Make sure to order it PRESSED, so it's toasted & warm! The sandwich was delicious, and a filling meal. I also ordered a dirty Chai latte with two shots of espresso  and oat milk.

You need to step into Flour Cafe.Removed slightly from the main streets, facing urban America's answer to a working parent's cry for a playground.

A plethora of pastries on display tantalizingly welcome you, seducing you to have you cheat on your commitments to a waistline or a healthy heart. If you abhor human interaction or just hate queues, a tablet takes your order and payment on the right as you enter. Places to sit are hard to find for groups but easy for single patrons. Listen for your name as it is yelled out, for the yelling isn't too loud but the yellers (no connection with cinematic canines) nice and friendly. The cakes and pastries are fresh, not as sweet as America has to offer generally and the smell of fresh coffee appropriately lingering. Sure its expensive, with a slice of Boston cream pie and a small coffee setting you back nearly 8-10$. But hey! Look around you, these people got money.

We heard other parties waiting for 40 minutes. Our waiter Jose was awesome and was the best service I have had at a restaurant in a long time. Even with waiting on a bunch of tables he remembered our names. I got the BBQ Western Burger and it tasted great and there was a lot of bacon which was a plus. My wife got the Mexicali Burger and they actually put a lot of avocado one which is a first in our experience. The burger was over done, twice, but they corrected it and they were really nice about making it right. Not a huge of wedge fries just because they aren't super crispy and there's a lot of potato but at least they were hot. Personally the other dishes were a little more than we wanted to pay which is why we stuck with the burgers ($16). So overall I would come back just for the service alone and try the food again. Glad we went and tried it out.> I came here after returning home from a trip. Due to the wonderful MBTA closures, I just happened to be starving in downtown. Some of my friends who work in a nearby office suggested Back Deck as a solid choice, so myself and the one other person I was with decided to try it fully based on its proximity to us at the time and this recommendation. The restaurant is in a great area that doesn't have a lot of other casual sit down lunch spots. The ambiance and decor inside was very tasteful and relaxed. When we visited it must have been about 3 o'clock on a Saturday, so the restaurant wasn't all that packed, especially because it is actually quite large despite its odd floor plan. As I mentioned, we were returning from a trip. The pair of us had small rolling bags the size of a standard carry on, a tote bag, and our purses. So, why the host decided he wanted to take us up the couple of steps to the higher level, and then seat us at a tiny two top where our things were actually overflowing to the table next to us and into the aisle where servers were walking was completely beyond me. It was not like we had large suitcases from a weeks long vacation either, so I felt it really shouldn't be that hard to accommodate us since we were also only two people. We turned to ask if we could sit at 4 top since it was not busy (as mentioned)- but the host was already gone! They just plopped the menus on the table and turned around wordlessly. So we just tried to condense ourselves and hoped that the host just didn't plan to seat anyone next to us. It took some time for our server to come over- so much time that we were actually fully ready to order by the time he came by, and we hadn't looked at menus online or anything prior. When he did come the initial problem was that we straight up could not hear him. The restaurant was not loud, he was really whispering! We asked him to speak up and he just, didn't. Either way it didn't matter since he never even said his name and only came back to our table by choice one time after that. He came back to our table and brought our drinks- which were wrong but he dropped them off and left wordlessly (that's the trend here maybe). We obviously hailed him over to swap the lemonade he gave us for the Diet Coke we actually asked for. It took him about 7 minutes to accomplish that task. I watched him put the lemonade down on an empty table nearby. Later, I watched him serve that same watered down lemonade to someone else! Mind you, we hadn't tasted or done anything to the lemonade at all- but he had no clue of that! Not only was the quality of the lemonade obviously not great due to fact that it was watered down, for all he knew we could've had some kind of contagious sickness. He had no idea if we had actually tried the lemonade or not as he took it wordlessly once again when we informed him that's not what we ordered.Meanwhile- you guessed it- the host seats someone next to us! Our stuff is literally overflowing, the ENTIRE row of two tops is completely empty, but the host seats a LARGE MAN directly next to us???? I won't continue on about how terribly uncomfortable the rest of the meal was due to this as it paints its own picture. All in all, the food saves this place. It is yummy! We got burgers which was what we were recommended to get by our friends. The fries are wedges which were divine, burgers cooked perfectly. Caesar salad was also a nice classic Caesar salad. I think it is reasonably priced for the food quality and the area. The overall service, however, was abysmal. You genuinely have to be an awful host to affect someone's entire meal. Our waiter what's-his-name couldn't even pretend to be friendly or pretend to care. Never came back to check if the food was correct (especially after he gave us a freakin lemonade instead of a Diet Coke). Had to again HAIL him down to get the check. Luckily we paid in cash and didn't have to hunt him down again. Despite this experience, I would give this place another shot. The food was seriously good and most of my distaste came from how much they didn't care how uncomfortable we were with our seating. Said thank you have a nice day to the host on the way out and was fully ignored to put the cherry on top. Maybe I'll try bar seating next time.> I'm a big fan of the little mini bar they have here. The hummus plate with the roasted/grilled carrots and pita was surprisingly good, I don't usually like hot things dipped in cold hummus but I'll be darned, it was incredible. The bartender was friendly and attentive, what more could you ask for? Not the biggest beer selection,, but a solid group of choices available. Little bit weird, but the bathroom isn't in the restaurant. You actually have to leave the front door and go down a hall to get to the bathroom, which is just awkward design wise, but not the biggest deal in the world!> Good food, good drinks, cozy atmosphere. Full bar made the 30 minute wait on a Saturday easy. The atmosphere was warm, softly lit. The layout, furniture and windows actually made it look, feel like a deck. Our food was very acceptable, but I think the steak here is where it's at as it looked like that's what a lot of folks were ordering. Service is fast and friendly.> A beautiful location with indoor and outdoor viewing. The menu was somewhere limited with not many selections. Usually for restaurants like these, I go for appetizers as I believe they thrive well. I enjoyed the chicken wings the most as it was crispy, enough for 1 and came relatively quickly during lunch time. I stayed away from the entree item which my friend did not and he did not enjoy his burger at all.","4, 3, 4, 5, 3"

Come for a decent and cheap burger!> The cheese burger was just ""ok"" - bun was not fresh enough - the tomato was anemic, and the cheese on the burgers was so thin you could not be sure it was a cheeseburger  We should have tried the chicken or salad.  The star here are the onion rings in a light tempura batter and the sweet potato fries are excellent.  The woman at the counter was very friendly and nice and the eating area was clean and acceptable - two TV's - one on sports and the other on CNN, which is a waste of time in a burger place -> Many options, fast, satisfying.They are able to handle a volume of people and have good fries and shakes> I recommend this place!! I got built your own burger with Beef patty, Bacon, Gouda, lettuce tomato, onion on wheat bread.  The patty could be a little ticker but it was delicious and juicy. It was very good and the price was reasonable 9.52$.The interesting thing is they have different offers for different days of the week from 3pm-7pm.","4, 3, 3, 5, 4"
Happy Lamb Hot Pot,Cambridge,4.0,2,Yes,Yes,No,Null,"Hot Pot, Chinese, Asian Fusion",Closed,Closed,Closed,Null,Closed,Null,Closed,Null,Null,"TLDR: Cool ambiance, lot of good options for vegans, a bit priceyTwo weeks ago, my best friend from California in town visiting and I took him to Happy Lamb Hot Pot, since the two of us kind of have a bit of history around going to hot pot spots when we're around each other. It was fairly busy when we came in on a Saturday night, but luckily we checked in on the Yelp waitlist and only had to stand around for about five minutes before getting seated. The overall aesthetic was really nice and I immediately liked the ambiance of the place.In terms of the actual food review, I can only really comment on the vegan options and mushroom broth since that's what I had, although I believe that my friend enjoyed the meat options too. I was a bit disappointed that the frozen tofu wasn't as good as some of the other places I've had (it was still quite good but not up to my expectations), but I really enjoyed the you tiao (Chinese fried doughnut sticks), mushrooms, and hand-pulled noodles.Brief disclaimer, the food is a bit pricey (I think the tofu plate was somewhere around $8-$10 for a fairly small portion) and probably would've spent $20-$25 per person even without eating any meat. Thus, as a result I'd call this place more of a higher-end splurge place than a regular go-to spot.Overall, I enjoyed the experience and was very happy by the end to have consumed so much hot pot. Will be coming back!> My friend took me here in February right before my surgery. I am a hot pot fanatic and I didn't know if I could eat hot pot again (total gastrectomy). I have not had hot pot since ! :( I would have to split my order with someone who isn't starving- haha. I'm glad we came in to try this place. The broths aren't very flavorful. But you get sooooo much freaking food. That's a plus ! We had so many extra veggies that my friend took them home:)Maybe I'm close minded, but Shabu zen and Q pot are better. Maybe I'll give it another shot.> Happy Lamb is one of my favorite and no doubt my most visited hotpot places in Boston! Despite the fact that its relationship with the real Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot is kinda sketchy, its flavor is unrivaled.I feel lucky to get to try their new lamb spine hotpot this time! I'm not sure if this is just seasonal, on soft opening or will last forever but I'm gonna seize the moment! This is a very traditional type of hotpot from northern China. The lamb soup and spine has been boiling for hours to maximize the flavor ... you taste the soup and share the spine/bones and bone marrow first (so yummy!!) and then cook your veggies and meat in the already delicious soup. Oooh this is absolutely the perfect combo for the incoming cold winter!I really really wish they could keep serving this! Although eating here can be a bit more pricey than what hotpot really should be, I still recommend it to all my friends!Tips: use Yelp to join the line cause it's mostly crowded upon dinner time!> Good location on Mass Ave, right near Central station and Hmart! It's a fairly large restaurant and pretty aesthetic for a hotpot place. I came here for an early dinner around 5ish, they're open before 5:30, which is what is listed online, so go beat the rush! My friend and I decided to get the best of both worlds broth to try out both regular and spicy broths. It was the best idea since happy lamb doesn't encourage the use of additional sauces. (They do have them, you just need to ask.) You order via a piece of paper writing down how many of each item you would like. We went for a splurge and decided to get the best organic lamb and beef on the menu along with watercress, fish balls, enoki mushrooms, and rice cakes. The spicy broth was super spicy if you let the enoki mushrooms and watercress soak and cook in it for a long time, but as for the other meats and food items, they were fine. There were so many flavors in the broth that we didn't need to ask for any sauces and experienced our hotpot in a different kind of way. The service here is super quick since they have so many waiters going around, filling our waters, and taking away empty dishes. They have such a variety of different broths and all the hotpot necessities, so I'd recommend checking this place out.> I went to happy lamb for the first time since I was a kid, and I'm disappointed to note that having hot pot here is not at all worth the price tag. We chose several cuts of lamb and beef, but most were tasteless. The usda beef, however, was juicy and flavorful.","5, 3, 5, 4, 3"

After biking by daily, I saw the ""coming soon"" sign and had been curious to check them out. Went in this morning and was impressed by the menu, dessert display, and cozy corner booth. Ordered a cappuccino and Townie Stacker to have there, but when I reached for my wallet - it wasn't there.  Naturally, I got very uncomfortable and try to get them to stop making my order after espresso was already ground and eggs about to be cracked. But Mister Q himself just says, ""Don't worry, everyone's human. Just come back tomorrow or whenever you can. Sit and enjoy your breakfast."" The grill master actually delivered my food, and even went back to grab me a napkin for what was a deliciously flaky croissant sandwich. After fretting for a bit about where my wallet could have gone, I found it in another corner of my backpack and paid before leaving, but the whole experience stuck with me. They have quite a large menu for the size of the place. My breakfast was delicious. I have high hopes for these guys. Don't get me wrong, I still love Zume's down the street and the community there, but for a new spot these guys left an impression and are well worth your time and money to check out.> What a great addition to the neighborhood! Pros: Lovely environment, very friendly staff, solid coffee, fair prices, and decent food. Cons: Not a lot of seating so it can get a little crowded, decent food. I list ""decent food"" as a pro and a con because it is. I went on two separate occasions (breakfast and lunch) and had a McGrill with bacon, chicken salad wrap on wheat, and minestrone soup. All items were good, but just not great. I did see someone with a panini that looked phenomenal and the pastries and cakes always look beautiful as well. So still more to try!! Either way, I think this is a great new spot in Charlestown and I hope they continue to stay busy!> Monument, I love you, but sometimes you just don't want to pay $15 for a burger. Mister Q, you are exactly what Main St Charlestown was missing!  Great menu, fast, friendly service and good food with reasonable prices. We got a cheeseburger, tuna melt, bowl of soup, iced chai latte and cappuccino to go all under $30. Food was made fresh and fast and the interior is clean. Welcome to the neighborhood!> Today was opening day of Mister Q!Charlestown is desperate for take out. Like, it's a serious problem. While there's an abundance of coffee shops around, we really, really need a good sandwich place. Anna's has food, but it's up and over the hill and my legs are tired of going up and over that hill and Style Cafe is at least a 30 minute walk to and from. I came in today for opening day (I had been peeking in for months with anticipation) and well, it was nice. Sorta forgettable, but perfectly pleasant with a nice menu. Breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, sandwiches, paninis, burgers and coffee. Desserts looked lovely. I ordered an Italian panini to-go. Sandwich came out quickly and with Cape Cod Chips and I happily walked home to try it. It was solid. Nothing earth shattering, but solid. Overall assessment- if I were downtown, I'd be like, that's nice but whatevs, but because it's in Charlestown, this cafe is a star.> It's great! Amazing BLT, fresh oj, homemade soup! Definitely check them out!Fresh OJ rocks too!","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

I got a bowl #1 that's one meat dish, vegetable choice, rice choice: I choose yellow rice, steamed veggies, and a perfectly crispy chicken dish. Took no time putting together, the serving comes with a drink and was all $8.50. Only thing, it's not a really fancy place (very bare and looks unfurnished) and the bathroom didn't work but it was 11/10 food so I was happy.> The staff are very rude  And ignorant Again very rude know upbringing Passive aggressive rude rude rude> This is the worst Dominican place I have ever eaten in my life. The chicken seems to have been cooked a week ago; it was so hard that the plastic fork couldn't even penetrate it (see photo). We tried the pork stew and got three large bones without any meat. The service was shit. And they didn't even have sweet plantains. If I could give less than one star, I would.> Bocao has amazing Dominican food! The chicken was not dry at all and the rice was super fluffy and well seasoned. The beans are obviously delicious and their portions are big.

Upon entering, it's a very small intimate restaurant. We loved our waitress Yuri who was very attentive. The drinks are mediocre, the negroni was the most bitter I've ever had. The espresso martinis tasted slightly watered down. Decent wine list.Shellfish tower for close to $140 we got 6 JUMBO shrimps, the biggest I've ever seen. Cherry stone clams were a tad fishy for me. Oyster selection is great. Generous portion of buttery lobster and king crab. Surf and turf- amazingly delicious from the seared scallops to the truffle mashed potatoes and to the braised short rib The risotto di Mare- tasted more like a tomato based orzo seafood pasta dish to me. Nonetheless still good but don't expect a typical risotto  Zuppa di Mare- can't really go wrong if you love seafoodLobster raviolis- highly recommend! 5 generously sized raviolis. I'm not typically a fan of creamy pastas but this one was delicious with the smoked bacon bits> Came here for restaurant week and I was not impressed. I ordered the tuna crudo appetizer, filet mignon entree, and bread pudding dessert. The others in my party also ordered off of the restaurant week menu including dishes like the swordfish and Bolognese. It seemed like they took the dishes off of their regular menu and shrunk the portion sizes. Yes, it's restaurant week but that's your time to shine to earn new customers! There are plenty of restaurants in Boston that offer their full portions during restaurant week. Everything was just ok. The tuna crudo was sooo thin and underwhelming. The filet mignon had an odd flavor to it, maybe it was the seasoning or sauce? Bread pudding was a little dry. The bartender at the front was very nice but overall service was slow. I think I would rather go to other restaurants in the North end.> We got: oysters, surf & turf, risotto di mare, sunshine (cocktail) Service is slooooow. Sunday night, 8.30pm. The space is pretty tight too. They bugged us a bunch to order within a few minutes of sitting, then disappeared for forever when we wanted to order. Oysters arrived, and we still haven't received any bread yet. Mains arrived, and still no sign of that elusive bread.Sunshine was pretty sweet, mostly just the taste of peach.The short rib in the surf and turf was excellent. The scallops (2) were very salty though, you had to eat it with the very sweet sauce to make it edible. Truffle mashed potatoes were.. Hit or miss, depending on where you bit. Parts were over buttered, parts had no truffle flavor, and vice versa.We finally found someone to flag down for the bread, after already finishing the surf and turf and halfway through the risotto. Our server gave us a confused response, as though he had no idea what bread we were referring to. It then arrived without any butter or dips, and asked if that was okay with us. Uh, why the heck would we ask for bread without any condiments? We're pretty much done with our meal - still no bread condiments.Risotto was.. Undercooked. Parts of rice were chonky and hard, and the seafood did not have the risotto flavor throughout. In fact, parts of the rice were cold. Meh. The whole shelled langostine on the top was impressive looking, but honestly, impractical to eat. We're done with our meal, and flagged down another server for our bread condiments. Oh, by the way, the bread was room temperature, and going on stale.Would not: everything except the oysters, but that's not even representative of the quality here.Would not come back. Would not recommend. Overpriced for middling quality Italian food. Come here if you're looking for a tourist trap.> Great hidden gem in the north end. Seafood was awesome, but their pasta sauce lacked flavor. Bustling date night spot for sure.> Celebrated a birthday here during Dine out Boston and had such a pleasant time! If you particularly love seafood, you'll have a great time here because the seafood here is fresh and cooked wonderfully. For my three-course meal, I chose the following dishes:First Course--Mussels and Clams: I found this dish to be really, really good.  I loved the broth that it was cooked in; super flavorful that I found myself just sipping on the broth all on its own once I finished all the seafoodSecond Course-- Risotto Frutti di Mare: again, really good! The risotto and seafood were cooked to perfection and the serving of seafood very generous so you got some heavenly seafood in each bite. Third Course--Chocolate Tortino: omg, so decadent. Really can't go wrong with this one, it was the perfect way to top off the meal! All in all, I had a really good experience here at Mare. I would say this is a pretty solid option if you're looking to eat at Boston's North End. I particularly love the atmosphere here--they have an outdoor eating area (though it is insulated during the winter) and there are bonfires right in the middle of the restaurant that you can actually sit right in front of (on a first come first serve basis). It makes the place feel very cozy and intimate, which I love!","4, 3, 2, 4, 4"

Thank goodness for Tampopo who made my Tokyo dreams come true with some seriously good and simple udon & tempura.Nothing fancy, and absolutely perfect.> Went in at 4:20ish on a Friday. We were the only ones there. Waitress was very nice. I ordered the curry pork katsu cutlet udon with egg & veggies, my brother ordered the pork cutlet curry over rice, and we split an order of the spicy chicken karaage.Soup came out first for my brother's meal. Good consistency and taste. Then our meals cane out; had to wait a couple more minutes for the appetizer.App was the spicy karaage chicken. Nothing fancy. Good quality chicken, not chewy or fatty. A little bland. The ""spicy"" part was just a dab of Sriracha garlic chili paste on top, not blended or house made. They had a little karaage sauce on the bottom, but nothing to write home about.My curry udon was good, healthy amount of food. Nothing too big, but great for the price. It seemed like they just added a bit of the curry sauce to the existing udon broth, instead of making the udon broth thicker they just let it be very watery, so it lessened the curry taste. Not bad. 3.5 stars for that. But the udon was cooked perfectly. I would have hoped for a bit more pork. A couple pieces of broccoli, a few green beans, and carrot for veggies. My brother's curry pork katsu over rice was much better. Same thing in terms of veggies and egg, but his curry was thick and rich, much better than the udon broth mixture. Again, we would've wished for a bit more pork, but the price is very reasonable.Overall I would say 3.5-4 stars based on food, price and the very nice waitress. Nothing crazy, but definitely not a bad little place that sums up to a college campus food court vibe.> 'Tis a late review, but....This is the spot to have my first udon soup. I had Pork w/ Egg & Curry udon soup, which was delightfully wonderful. Eating thick noodles was never my thing, but this one was an exception. I enjoyed this thoroughly, although I had a bit of digestive cramp afterward, which was the reason why this type of noodle wasn't my thing. However, you may enjoy this joint far more than I had.Be warned: you need cash to pay, and the number of seats was really limited. I think the soup was worth the wait in a line.> I was in Porter Square and looking for a lunch place. I found this on yelp and tried it out. I ordered tempura combo: squid, shrimp, egg plant, white fish tempura comes with salad and rice. The dressing for the salad was super good. Tempura was very good, too. I wouldn't say fancy, but definitely authentic. It remind me of the home-style taste of Japan. As a Japanese, I cook Japanese food at home all the time, but not tempura, because it mess up my kitchen, so it was a great opportunity to have it here.> Went with a friend who knew the chef, so we explored every part of the menu! From the appetizers to the ramen to the desserts, everything was so good! Felt like I was in someone's home kitchen.

Especially the lamb burger. But just be warned that everything seems at least 1.5 times more expensive than similar food elsewhere. But the taste seems at least 1.5 times better as well.> Years ago this place was advertised as a hop pot restaurant which could not stand out among bunch of outstanding hotpot restaurants nearby.However, recently they provide multiple new featured dishes which are extremely good. The lamb skewers we tried was rich of flavor since they use multiple Chinese ingredients. The lamb spine cut pot is very authentic. The lamb spine cuts come with a thin layer of fat on each piece which is scrumptious. Stewed spicy chicken is also recommended. In addition, try their lamb soup. They serve lamb intestines, lungs and stomaches in the soup. I can tell the broth of the soup is made from lamb meat. The only pity is that every dish is a little bit too salty, but the food quality is undeniably good. I wish the quality won't decrease as time passing by.> Bleh and meh. After I got over the disappointment of not being able to order a drink, I was totally underwhelmed by the food and service.> Definitely top 3 worst Chinese restaurant in our list. It is ridiculously expensive and serve mediocre food with very low quality and quantity. This is our first and definitely last time, we ordered basically all their ""signature"" dishes to go, and what a surprise when we open it in home...just to mention fewLamb bone soup : flavorless watery broth with few dry half cold bones inside that costs you almost 40$, it doesn't worth even 5$ the soup.Lamb spine: the whole lamb spine portion consists of no more than 7 pieces of dry flavorless microwave heat over cooked lamb meat with hard attached bone of size of your middle finger , 30$...Lamb shank: this is the worst, a totally nightmare, you cannot actually call it a lamb shank, it consists of literally a bone with a very small ration of over cooked super dry and again flavorless fried diced meat in the bottom of the box. It is absolutely absurd! Guess the price? Another 30$... In sum , everything is so dry,  flavorless and hard to bite, and not to mention that ridiculous price...we paid over 200$ and almost threw everything.If you are looking for Mongolian food, this place will definitely be your nightmare.> Where to start with this place?! Going in I was not expecting the best experience with it's average 3 star rating. However, I also noticed a peppering of 4 stars among the sea of mediocre reviews so I figured it deserved a fair shot. We arrived around 6:30 pm with a larger group and a reservation so they had 3 tables put together ready for us. The hot pot burners were only on the 2 end tables so the ones in the middle would not have access. We resigned to trying their ""BBQ"". I noticed most everyone else who passed through went with the hot pot instead (it's really hard to mess this up). Much of the meat on their menu consists of lamb, so they don't really have great options otherwise. Really if you have tried 1 meat dish, you have tried them all. I have no idea why this restaurant went ALL IN with this spice powder that they doused nearly every item on the menu. My SO aptly pointed out that it tasted strangely reminiscent of Ortega or whatever taco kit's seasoning... All of the items offered on the BBQ menu were small plates style so it was not very filling nor tasty. To sell the Mongolian ambiance they have a variety of different Tuvan throat singing for background music. I've attached the receipt of what we ordered and it turned out to be way more expensive than anticipated for 4 people. Service was fine and nothing notable. We had limited interactions with them since we just ticked off the sheet they provided with the dried out markers. They did proactively separate our checks by the 3 tables though without us asking. So that is a plus. However, I was dismayed to see that they presumptuously gave themselves 20% tip because of our larger group. Usually it's 18%... I know it's only a couple dollar difference, but it just left another bad taste in our mouths on top of the subpar food.Taro Milk Tea - they used powder and didn't properly blend this. The drink came ""warm"" with ice to cool it down and still powder chunks visible.Plum Juice - average taste, looks like coke Lamb Kebab - completely coated in the strange seasoning but it was more palatable than the other food.BBQ Corn - tasted fine they were 2 corn cobs cut in half for 4 pieces on a skewer. Difficult to get off the skewer.BBQ Marshmallows - they advertised it walking in so we ordered and it looked like just toasted ones. Thankfully they didn't douse it in their seasoning haha. We could have gotten 2 bags of marshmallows from the store to toast ourselves.Scallion Pancake - tasted cold when it arrived and they only gave us soy sauce for dipping...Mongolian Pie - this was one of the better items we ordered it had lamb inside but tasted mostly fried.BBQ Enokie - drenched in a salty sauce. Our friends also ordered 2 servings of this and theirs were super spiced for some reason.Pumpkin Pie - tasted very little of the pumpkin and more the fried doughy portion.Crepe Dough - probably the best of the bad batch that we tried. It tasted sweet (refreshing change from the taco seasoning) and eggy with a fried dough stick in the middle.BBQ Beef meat ball - way too chewy and dried out once again drenched in that taco seasoning.Were we full afterwards? A little bit, but definitely not satisfied. I actually had to RUN to the bathroom because I think the food really upset my stomach promptly giving me diarrhea. Also dealt with the consequences all night long thereafter. (TMI, sorry!) We promptly made our way over to the Starbucks a block away to cleanse our palate with sugary coffee drinks. I would not recommend anyone stop by here to eat unless you are starving and no other restaurants are open nearby. Many of the other customers appeared to be staff from Mass General Hospital across the street. If we end up back here I'll skip the BBQ and cautiously try the hot pot. I wouldn't want to pay the extra fee for sauces.","5, 3, 4, 2, 1"

Great family run spot and probably my favorite Jamaican food in Boston.> Had a taste for Caribbean food haven't been here in years wish I would have skipped all together. Ordered a small rice and peas with steak and vegetable. 10.75 was the price I think that's a little pricey for a small but ok. The rice and peas were flavorless the steak was really dry and flavorless the cabbage was actually the best thing on the plate. I will never eat here again. So disappointed! I should have honestly just tried the newest only one location on river st.> Best Jamaican food around..I give this food a 5star..straight authentic...prices are good and the food portion alot> Had the small jerk chicken plate with rice n beans And veggies. Wow was it tasty. I'd say the best Jamaican food I've had in Massachusetts. The chicken was rich, juicy and flavorful. The jerk has a very potent and tasty blend of spices. It is also quite spicy once you finish eating, it creeps up on you. The small portion was huge, but I guess it should be for 9$. The chicken deff had bones and a good amount of small ones so I know some people wouldn't like that, but it adds to the flavor. The veggies were also very good, almost like a slow stewed collard green, but maybe w some other veggies and chopped up, a good side to cut the spicy meat. I will certainly be back for more jerk chicken plates.","5, 5, 1, 5, 5"

We tried the Thai bbq pork, beef drunken noodles, green curry with tofu, and pineapple fried rice with crispy chicken.The pineapple fried rice with crispy chicken and beef drunken noodles were amazing! I loved the crispy chicken, which had a crispy outside and tender chicken interior, and the rice was well-cooked and really tasty. I liked the sliced onions and raisins mixed into the dish. The drunken noodles were also delicious, with tasty vegetables and a decent amount of beef and soft, springy noodles.The green curry was flavorful, and the fried tofu pieces and vegetables were nicely cooked, but it would have been nice to have the curry and rice served separately, as the curry sort of seeped into the rice and then dried a bit, making it look a bit unappealing as time went on. I would still get a curry the next time I come here, but that is something to keep in mind. The bbq pork was not bad but definitely paled in comparison with the other dishes, and I wouldn't order it again. The meat was only okay, and we weren't wild about the flavors of this dish.Overall, Is'Original is a really great place to grab a meal. I would recommend sharing dishes. Our waitress was really nice and after asking whether we were sharing the dishes, brought out separate plates for each of us. Thanks for a great meal, Is'Original; I'll definitely be back! :)(Note: I've noticed that it is difficult to find this business on Yelp; it only shows up in the suggested dropdown when I type in Is'Original but is not in the list of businesses if I enter the search query. For search purposes, it might help if there were a space between Is' and Original in the title. The restaurant might also just not show up because the name was changed somewhat recently.)> Ordered here through GrubHub for the first time and underwhelmed.They literally followed no instructions on my special instructions, which in large print said No Tofu, and it was packed with tofu.And it tasted strange despite me having this exact dish at at least ten other Thai places.  I don't understand how an order with 2 items, you can't follow special instructions when making one of them.> I walked by this placw probably like a hundred times but never stopped by and that was my mistake. Their crispy pork belly is just done right. And what I meant by that is the skin is still crispy and evenly coated with your choice of sauce! Highly recommended the golden bags appetizer! Crunchy on the outside and the nutty of the taro on the inside makes the name. And no, it's not oily at all! The staffs are friendly and upbeat. Overall, wish I would have known this place earlier!!> This is unbelievable. The food arrived cold outside and extremely dry and hard. I cannot even insert the fork in their crispy chicken. The pancakes are so tasteless. I saw the 4 stars rating and expected something nice but this is not the case. The fried rice is obviously over cooked to the point that I can even see the dark spots in the rice. After trying so hard to eat, my stomach hurts. I'm going to the airport so I was hoping to get some solid delivery before my flight, got so disappointed. Also food arrived without utensils so be aware of that. Called the grub hub and hoped for a refund from the restaurant but the restaurant refused to issue the refund. Like do I want to ever order from you guys again? Probably no. After an hour and the deliver guy was still trying to find the address.... probably the WORST delivery experience I have ever had in my entire live. Avoid!> It's definitely a hidden gem. The portions are super size in my opinion and their pad Thai is a true authentic traditional style. I highly recommend all of their staple dishes. Their appetizers are handmade and served to perfection.","4, 2, 5, 1, 5"

We initially thought we were there for the Dine Out Boston menu but turns out they didn't do Saturdays.

Once again, please remind your servers/host that it's your birthday if it is or you won't get your keepsake photo :( lowkey sad I dont have it this year T_T> Great service and food! My sister and I decided to come here during restaurant week. We made a reservation in advance because Morton's could get very busy. The server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I opted to try their pork chop; however, was afraid it wouldn't be cooked all the way. The server communicated with me and recommended to get it butterfly cut so the pork chop cooks evenly -- great tip! The portion was big enough to split as I had leftovers. The pork chop came with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes lacked in gravy, though, I asked for a side. The texture was very smooth; not too thick or runny. All in all, I will be back!!> When you are looking for the finest in classic steakhouses with service to match, look no further than Morton's.  With the newer establishment in the Seaport District of Boston, Morton's has become a destination for celebratory dinners as well as a pre-event meeting place.This review is specifically referencing a visit recently with a team of co-workers as we got ready for a holiday celebration at a neighboring venue.  The took a reservation for our party of 8 with high top tables facing the windows which also made people watching fun.  The service of our wait staff was exceptional; attentive, knowledgeable, helpful, supporting and accommodating.  Oh, and a great sense of humor to keep us laughing and on our toes whenever needed.  The bar bites were delicious.  We samples most things on the menu, but particular favorites included the Short Rip Steak Tacos!!  They were fabulous and required another order so all could enjoy.  The Tuna Tacos were crunchier with a little zip to them while the mini crab cake BLTS were good too.  The potato chips and Parmesan truffle french fries were also a big hit that required refilling as others joined our little party. All in all, Morton's is a quality establishment where you know you will always find great food and service.> Fantastic service and food!Took my family for a birthday dinner party and was treated like royalty from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.

It's located right next to Boston Commons and has everything that you'd need (only drawback is no gym, but hey what more can you ask for from a 1800s establishment?). I had the pleasure of both staying in one of the guestrooms as well as dine for dinner. The guestroom I stayed in on the 4th floor was well-apportioned and had an ensuite bathroom. The rates for guestrooms are quite reasonable considering Boston hotel rates (~$250).For dinner, I had amazing scallops and the honey mousse dessert. Both were quite delicious and again reasonably priced. I'm glad I chose to stay here as opposed to your average hotel. I mean, not everyday you get to walk over steps taken by Ralph Waldo Emerson, right?> I am a reciprocal club member and decided to visit the union club for dinner one evening. The service was spectacular our waitress made sure we had everything we needed and even gave us complimentary appetisers. The Osso buco was one of the best i have ever had and the bottle of wine our waitress recommended paired really well with our meal. We had a one of a kind view of boston commons from our table.The entire club does a good job of exhibiting the history of Boston through the eyes of this institution. The only thing better than the service was the elegance of the building. We both thoroughly enjoyed our evening a the union club.> I love the Union Club. You have to be a Member, or be WITH a Member in order to even eat here. On the menu, there are only a handful of items, each more delicious than the next. Soft Shell Crab? Yes please. Five Cheese Tortellini Pasta? Yes please.Veal Steamship? Oh my God, Yes PLEASE.Fontina and Prosciutto Stuffed Wood Grilled Veal Chop?(The writer of the review has stepped away for the moment to satiate his growing hunger. He will return momentarily).........Anyway,That's JUST the food. The real charm of the Union Club is from it's history and architecture. It was founded in 1863 to help raise support for the Union soldiers and political agenda during the Civil War. It was formerly the house of Edward Everett, who was a President of Harvard. If you are ever lucky enough to set foot in the amazing establishment, be sure to check out as much of the place as possible. It's a wonderful, wonderful conglomeration of historical paintings, photos, sculptures and even furniture from the 1860's through today. All sorts of famous Bostonians have been members throughout the years, including people like Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Murray Forbes and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Neat, huh?> Came here for an alumni dinner for Suffolk University. The entrance to this place, which is right near No. 9 Park, is super discreet. You would almost think you were entering a old back bay apartment building. Once inside I went up the elevator to where the alumni event was being held. I was really impressed with the service as well as the food. Almost everything that came out of the kitchen was great.> The Club has a rich history and is located nr the State House and on the Boston Common.  As a reciprocal club member I jumped at this opportunity because Boston hotels are expensive.  Beautifully furnished with period antiques, dark wood, and lithos, the Club takes you back to an era of 2 generations ago.  That being said,  I can't recommend the overnight bedrooms.  Our was very large with a non-working fireplace and an enormous ensuite bathroom.  Unfortunately noise from Park street at all hours, the clanging of the radiators, and sound from the adjoining room  made for terrible sleep.  The walls are so thin I could hear the fellow next door coughing.  Not his fault!If you simply want to dine there, go!  The DR is handsome, as is the bar.  Service and food top notch.  Traditional menu items which are perfectly cooked and presented.  Quiet.  I would actually give 5 stars for the food and dining.So go if you only want to eat!","5, 5, 5, 4, 3"

My partner and I tried two appetizers and two main dishes because everything sounded really good.For appetizers, we had the lobster ravioli and the eggplant in carrozza. The lobster ravioli was great--it came with four pieces filled with a generous amount of lobster (and some cheese) in a tasty pink sauce.The eggplant in carrozza was also amazing--the fried eggplant was crispy and complemented the stronger prosciutto, and the pesto cream sauce was delicious! (Not overly creamy and very basil-y :) )For our main course (by which point I was unfortunately already starting to get full--I still ate more because it was so good), we tried a pasta dish and a pizza. The fusilli amatriciana sauce was delicious, and we were glad we opted for the handmade fusilli because the pasta tasted fresh. The North Ender was a white pizza with a ton of prosciutto, and it was flavorful and had an amazing, chewy crust.To finish off our meal, we tried the tiramisu. This was honestly one of my favorite tiramisu desserts I've had at a restaurant--it was made and served in the traditional way and was delicious!When we arrived, the owner/manager was really welcoming, and our waitress was super nice. Overall, I'd highly recommend coming to BenCotto for amazing Italian food!> One of many Italian restaurants in the heart of Boston's North End. Nice place with pretty good food but nothing too outstanding compared to the many similar options nearby. Came for lunch on a Saturday around noon and had no wait. The place was not crowded and service was friendly.Our favorite dish was the lobster ravioli. It came in a pretty pink cream sauce and there was a good bit of lobster in there. Very soft texture. We also liked the eggplant rollatini, which was basically a cannoli wrapped in eggplant instead of dough. The inside was the same cheesy mix and it was smothered in tomato sauce. We also got a bruschetta appetizer which was just okay. Crispy bread and tomato topping but not a whole lot of flavor.Comment on the ambiance. On one hand this place seems to go for a classy Italian feel with old fashioned music playing and well-presented dishes on solid white plates. On the other hand they had several TVs playing sports while we were there, which was kind of distracting. Seems like they should go all-classy or all-sports-bar but not a mix.> Low quality of service but the boss was nice enough to solve our issue.One of the tall waiter was being aggressive whenever we talked to him. We mentioned that the pizza was salty to us and asked politely if they can make another one that was less salty. But the waiter was a bit intimidating and said things like ""but you almost finished the pizza"". Then he took the pizza out of the desk. I thought he would ask the cook to make changes or make new pizzas for us. But it ended up him replying ""we can't make new pizzas"" and He threw the pizza we ordered. Yes, there were only 2 pieces left on the plate and that's because my friend who ordered it had one and she asked me to have another piece to double check if it was salty or not.Lastly, the boss came to us and was nice and polite. He  provided us a new pizza that's less salty and same as another female waiter who showed us clear instruction. We possibly ordered one pizza that supposed to be salty according to what the Boss's explanation. But the way tall male waiter served us was unprofessional and rude. Both me and my friend thought the tall male waiter was being mean to us as customers and we felt very uncomfortable speaking to him. The restaurant can definitely work on improving a better service to the customer in the future.> Made an rvsp for 7pm for 5ppl and arrived there and my table wasn't ready.Was asked to wait outside for 10mins but when 10 mins passed I asked again and they yet again said 10 mins. Mind you it was 30 degrees & really windy so we were outside waiting in the cold. I went into the office and noticed other groups have gotten seated without mine. Then I went to wait inside where it's warmer. Meanwhile there's another group was complaining with the manager about the wait. It's really ridiculous, if we make an rsvp why would i want to come and wait 45 mins additional. This is very upsetting as I was here just for the weekend and I had lots on my agenda  I planned and wanting to do but since of the delay we had to make adjustments. Please be truthful with the time wait and don't over accept rvsp if you do not have one available. And we waited a total of 1.5 hours I WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!> Came here for a birthday celebration with my family. Our waiter was very kind. I had the misto de pesce and loved it! Added red chili flakes to add that little kick, no Parmesan necessary. My family ordered the chicken Marsala, vegetable pasta (primavera? I forget) and lobster ravioli.

I had koshari when I was in Egypt and have not found it here in the States until now. This is even better than the ones I had overseas! I first met them at Somerville Winter Farmer's Market and I was thrilled to see they now have a store in Bow Market. The koshari is delicious, the spicy garlic and spicy tomato based sauces are amazing. They are also vegan and very filling with the lentils, noodles, and grains. The browned onions are perfection! If you love garlic, you will love this. It's perfect comfort food for a cold winter's night.> Delicious and filling. don't miss out cos much much better than middle eastern foods that have become mainstream in America, like falafel or hummus. The browned onions, garlic sauce, tomato / spicy sauce combined with the rice, lentils, macaroni make for a homey savory umami filled bowl that is a perfect lunch. Healthy and vegan! I'd have this every day if I could!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

Roma was great.  Very attentive and nice to speak with. Will probably stop here a few more times this w e.> This place sucks hard. North 26/100 must be what the 26 stands for. We're visiting Boston because it's our cousin's birthday 26/100. We made a reservation for 7. Didn't get our drinks until 7:15. How hard is it to pour beer out of the draft? And then got our clam chowder appetizer at 7:30 and it was cold clam chowder.Then finally got our food at 8. Ordered seafood pasta and salmon. All the prices  of their entrees are north of $26 but taste like a dish worth 26 cents. The salmon wasn't too bad but this was all relative to the extremely bland seafood. Also eventually we got some appetizer bread but they might as well have served us stones with butter. That crap was uneatable.To make matters worse our waiter or waiters or managers were so bizarre. Think we met 8 people continually asking the same questions. Interrupting our meal to ask weird questions beyond what typical waiters would ask. It really seemed like it was their first time ever serving as waiters. I feel bad for our cousin who had to eat such a gross birthday meal.But let me tell you, this place is great if you're looking to treat out someone you hate. You are guaranteed warm beer, cold soup, weird service, and gross overpriced entrees! Enjoy trolling!> Had a great brunch here today before leaving Boston and was not disappointed!  Our waitress was a doll.  She knew we were starving and brought us warm bread.  She was on her first day there and did a great job.My hubby had the turkey panini with salad instead of fries.  I had the tuscan sunrise sandwich served with home fries.  The Tuscan sunrise was a fried egg, asiago cheese, bacon, and arugula on sourdough.  We really enjoyed it.  Portion sizes were big and prices were fair. Highly recommend!> Came here for lunch Thursday to get the lobster special. It was $20 for a 1.5 lb. Lobster, corn on the cob, potatoes, and a cup of their clam chowder. You do have to purchase a drink, which, was no big deal to us hahah. It was a great deal and I would definitely come back for it. The service was a tad bit slow but our server was nice. Will be coming back for another boujie lunch :)> Folks the $20 lobster special IS a definite must. We were staying at the hotel and thought the special might have been mediocre because it's a hotel restaurant BUT NOT AT ALL. The clam chowder was perfect, the lobster steamed perfectly, the corn on the cob fresh. And to top of off the service is great. We could have eaten here every night. Best deal in Boston.","5, 1, 5, 4, 5"

We ordered:+ The vegan pizza with roasted beets, bean puree, corn and vegan mozz+ Fried artichoke salad with whole and fried artichokes (3), tomatoes, arugula, crispy shallots. For vegan, no feta and substitute dressing for either balsamic lemon/garlic. Got the balsamic which was good+ Chickpea gyro - made vegan with no tzatziki. Comes with onions, cucumber tomatoes and several chickpea fritters inside a rolled pitaThe salad was the favorite, it satisfied both the need for greens and for crispy fried not healthy things. The gyro was also really good and filling. The pizza was our least favorite, maybe I wasn't super into the bean puree, though it was still good. Really good beer list. Kitchen's open pretty late which is a big draw.Currently don't have alternative milks for their coffee, but according to server, oat milk coming next week.> I've been coming here for years and always enjoy it. They have a great vibe, plenty of space, shuffleboard and a good drink selection. But after last night, I'm not sure I'll be back. They have a bartender with long jet black hair and heavy eye makeup who just treats her customers like scum. She's blatantly rude and impatient. Like hi, we're here to pay you money and leave you tips! I'm ordering 10 beers for 10 people, which means you're going to get a bigger tip on a bigger bill! Maybe don't roll your eyes at me and snap and slam the glasses and bill down on the counter because it took the group a minute to decide on drinks! I may end up reaching out to management about her because she's ruining an otherwise great place to hang out.> ****mice alert***We went there last week and sat in the smaller room at the back, just before they bring our food to the table we saw a mouse coming out from under the radiator which has a woonden cover. It was walking so freely and was not scared of people and noises at all. When we told the waitress, it didn't seem to surprise her at all, she said she wIll check to see if she can move us to the main room. Another waitress told us sorry but thats a basement and it happens, I assure you there is non in the kitchen. After couple of minutes one of the managers stoped by and he did not even appologizee, he simply asked: how's everything?!!!Seeing a mouse where you want to have dinner is preetty annoying and disgusting, on top of that the way they reacted so cool about it was even more annoying.When I complained to the manager he said dinner is on us yoU don't need to pay but it had killed our appetite and we just left.> Not bad! Not amazing! You can smell the truffle fries from the street and it will lure you in. And they are delicious, you will finish the whole basket I guarantee it. They  have $ oysters on Monday which is pretty cool but was pretty disappointed with the avocado toast. I guess it's not the best place to get avocado tOast but I wanted something light and they do have very limited choices fOr light meals. The bread was very dRy (dare I say stale), and there were more toppings (eh stale bacon) thann avocado. It was  pretty for the eye, I wish it was as pretty for the tummy. Overalll, worth it for the Monday oysters and truffle fries and atmosphere but main meals are quite average.> Had a great dinner here at the bar. It took a little while to get greeted by the bartender, but once she said hi, it was smooth sailing from there.I asked about a few options and settled on the Hopewell burger. It was delicious (bacon, horseradish cheddar, red onion jam) and cooked exactly to my medium rare specifications. Even the fries were delicious.I also had the rose on tap. I was asked if I wanted a 2nd glass of wine. I wannnted it, but I didn't think it was a good idea to do a full glass. I asked if I could do a half pour for half price and I was given a half pour at no cost. What!? Thank you! I tipped generously.There seemed to be a lot of regulars in there that were chatting it up with the bartenders. It was a good atmosphere and I enjoyed the food and my wine (especially the bonus pour :-) I'll be back around here soon enough and I will 100% come back to Hopewell.","5, 1, 1, 3, 5"

Many Bostonians would agree with me that it is rare to find good affordable Japanese pub style restaurants, especially in Boston. I was hesitant to try this place as my experience with their chain in Allston-Brighton few years back. I decided to give it another try after I heard they recently moved to Porter. Boy I'm glad they move closed to my house! We ordered sushi combo, some special sushi(tuna, snapper and etc.), Suguyaki Okonomiyaki, Ika yaki and of course a glass of cold Asahi beer  sushis were surprisingly good, probably better than sushis from most of sushi restaurants in Boston lol Ika yaki was perfectly cooked and Okonomiyaki was pretty good, but I would've wanted it to have more toppings like I had ones in Japan. I'd definitely recommend this place and keep in mind that you probably need to wait at least 30 minutes if you are coming here on weekend nights. We waited about 40 minutes on Saturday night, which wasn't that bad. I believe that you can put yourself on Yelp waitlist, so utilize that! My dumb self forgot to do that and had to wait more :P> Ittoku is a japanese restaurant that specializes in small plates that are more for family style sharing than individual dining. It is on the pricier side as well so sharing is optimal.All the dishes are great but the standout dishes to me were the beef tongue steaks for starters. The flavor is incredible and the meat itself is wonderfully tender. Next, the mantaiko (?) Pasta was a special but delicious. Its like a cod roe creamy pasta that was lighter than expected but refreshing compared to the umami of the beef tongue. Pass on it though if you dont like fishy taste for obvious reasons. Okonomiyaki is huge. Very different dish but I wont say it's a must. Yakisoba wrapped in egg is a good dish but also nothing incredible. Grilled squid is a large portion and tastes great. Really cool seeing the whole squid. Skewers were also great, loved the gizzard and pork bellyThese are just a few dishes that I had that stood out or are pretty hyped here. Definitely a place to visit> I was so excited to try Ittoku but was unfortunately pretty underwhelmed by the dishes we ordered. I felt that the prices were pretty steep given the amount of food in each order - the salmon ikura mini don ($7) contained only two pieces of salmon and a pretty small serving of ikura. The carpaccio and house okonomiyaki were ok, but I wasn't particularly impressed especially given all the rave reviews I'd seen. Even so, the lively atmosphere made for a pretty positive dining experience. Would definitely be open to giving this another try!> I have to say I liked Ittoku way more when it was still on Commonwealth. Now that they have moved, their price also went up dramatically compared to what they used to be. Very disappointing to say the least. Here are examples of disappointment:1. Skewer Price and Quality:  my favorite skewer used to be chicken skin and chicken tail. Before it used to be around 2 dollars per which is reasonable, so they have doubled to 4 dollars each. Think about it, for 8 dollars you can get a good lunch, here you get two skewers. They have the 5 skewered for 13 dollars deal for mix and match, but they will you chicken gizzards instead because it's so much cheaper. 2. Price in General: My girlfriend and I spent 40 dollars each for the meal and we weren't even full at the end. Where as before 30 dollars on average can be satisfying, now it's 50 or 60. Most dishes the prices went up by at least 2-3 dollars, inflation don't even increase that fast come on.3. Portion: they have drastically reduced some dish portion as well. For example, omusoba which was a stable on the menu, they used to serve you entire portion wrapped in omelette but now they are cut into smaller pieces.I used to go to Ittoku every month or so, now I don't think I will be back. Sugidama Izakaya by Davis Square is much better from both price and quality standpoint.> Thank you so much for opening in these difficult time. Take out is the only dining option but the food quality is still super impressive! Hang in there! Can't wait to dine in when things are back in normal.","5, 4, 3, 3, 5"

The atmosphere is A+ and the food and drink are well beyond that. The burnt ends are so tender and literally melt in your mouth. Try it with the carolina sauce. Plenty of cocktail/beer options including their own house draft. All in all, worth every single penny.> I try to do the right thing, you know, support my local business in a very trying time. Even though I'm told to stay home, I order what I hope will be a delicious meal and venture out to pick it up even though I'm not supposed to leave the house.So I order said meal, pick it up and take it home. Only to discover that the order taker doesn't care to clarify what could easily be rectified with a simple question when by affirming what hot sauce I want with my ribs: ""Would you like the Hot BBQ Sauce or regular hot sauce,"" is all it takes to make sure your customer doesn't get home and find his meal incorrect.  Who puts regular hot sauce on Memphis dry rub? I guess someone does, but not me.But no question is asked, perhaps the proprietor is just happy to have an order. No question is asked and the dinner is ruined. Upon calling the restaurant informing the person of the order slight, I'm not given much of an apology, when a BBQ joint should ask if someone really wants regular old hot sauce on their ribs. Nope, no big or small apology, or even an acknowledgement when I recommended that next time maybe the order taker should at least confirm which hot sauce I want. Nope, just a casual flippant attitude that furthers makes me, the customer, already on edge and weary that an insane virus is going to wipe me off the face of the earth, go batshit insane and toss the whole dinner in the trash. Again, who wants nasty Tabasco on their Dry Rub?I know this is a trying time for all of us, but simple acknowledgement of another's annoyance is not much to ask.  Nor acknowledgement of a simple request that in the future an order taker ask clarifying questions.  I wanted to really brush it off, but it pisses me off that even now, the typical Boston attitude of some proprietors who think they're doing you a favor by you buying from them is flying strong.> We came here excited and wanted to love it, but were disappointed.Pros:- The service. Our waitress was very kind and helpful - The portions were large- The fried pickles were great- The maple mashed potatoes are amazing and honestly I'd come back just for them! Cons:- The food was okay, but most of it was dry (the corn bread in particular but 2/3 meats as well- we got the  pulled pork, bbq chicken, and sausage. The sausage was good.","5, 5, 5, 1, 3"

Katherine (events manager) and the rest of the team at Serafina Downtown were absolutely incredible. We held both our ceremony and reception in the space, utilizing both floors of the restaurant. The layout is spacious enough for a wedding event but also has smaller spaces for more intimacy.Katherine was incredibly responsive to our emails during the planning process and was always willing to meet with us and do walk-throughs to sort out layouts and set-ups. On the day of the event, the team went above and beyond to prepare the space, which was already beautiful and tastefully decorated. They even added a line of votive candles along the staircase. The entire set up was magical and gorgeous and throughout the evening, the staff was friendly and eager to assist us and our guests. I would highly highly recommend Serafina as a wedding venue!> Serafina is a lovely, very conveniently located Italianish restaurant in downtown Boston. It's very spacious and nicely decorated with a warm ambiance. The servers were attentive and fairly prompt. It's a great place for a business meal. The food is fine. Lots of variety from pasta to salads to pizza. It's pricey, but not surprising for downtown Boston. It's not horrendous, just nothing remarkable. The gelato was very boring and tasted like plain ice cream... I could tell ;).> Came here during a work luncheon and I'm so glad I did. Serafina is so nicely decorated and the waitstaff were very friendly and helpful. They had very fresh and delicious items - I had the Truffle Pasta. The smell and taste were immaculate if you like truffle oil, especially. That dish was just so good, I was a little upset when I finished it because I can't get enough of it!> Great place for business meals and drinks in the financial district. Fried calamari comes with marinara sauce and this fancy lemon that has a net to catch seeds. They even have the tall branded Peroni glasses to drink the Italian equivalent of Bud Light. Some of my top picks here: Lobster Ravioli, Steak Frites, Truffle Pizza, and if I am trying to be healthy, the lobster Salad or the the steak salad. The lobster ravioli is really rich and the sauce is so good that I'll have to order extra bread to dip into it. For a shareable side, the mussels are also really great. The soup they cook it in is also pretty good as well. In the summer, they have an outdoor patio where you can enjoy a view of a couple brick walls and summer street. Not ideal views for a spot downtown, but it is definitely refreshing to be outside.> Last week I was at Serafina for the first time for a business dinner with a private group. The restaurant is busy and in the middle of the business district which makes it a favorite for the after hours business crowd.We had a preset menu which was varied and allowed options for meat eaters or, in my case, not. The quality of the food was excellent. I had a burrata and tomato salad followed by grilled salmon. Dessert was a choice of sorbets. The salad was properly sized i.e. for one person, and not drowned in olive oil. The salmon was grilled just right with a crispy outside and the inside sufficiently juicy to be on the right side of done. The dessert was an appropriate ending after a satisfying meal.We had pre-chosen wines for the group dinner so I can't say anything much about the wine list. The service was adequate but not what might be expected from some high end restaurants.I will definitely go back if the occasion calls for it, but in my view the Boston north end Italian restaurants offer better food and value.","5, 3, 5, 5, 3"

Felipe's is a great place for fast, cheap and tasty tacos/burritos. The super burritos I ordered were fresh, flavorful, and HUMONGOUS. I have a pretty big appetite, and finishing an entire burrito was a bit of a struggle and kept me full for almost the whole day. In terms of meat selection, both the al pastor and carnitas are really great options. One thing I will say is that the process of ordering and standing in line is a bit of a stressful experience, as they move very quickly and you don't really have time to think about what you want. So maybe look at the menu ahead of time before coming in to order, or else the employees might not be too happy with you.> Fed up---The last 2/2 times I've ordered delivery.. they omit the chicken. What are the odds?> My only problem with Felipe's is we end up here anytime we drink Harvard Square area. No matter which friends I am with. :)How anyone could give this place less than five stars is beyond me. The food is fantastic and practically free for Harvard square. Drinks are strong and bar service is good considering how busy it can good. Tips:Get the fish tacos with fish not shrimp, it's amazing (shrimp is good too) Insider hack: There are *always* two lines. No one ever walks down to the line that starts at the opposite end, so it's almost always shorter if there is a long line.Lastely, GET THE FISH TACOS.> I continuously recommend Felipe's to my friends! Felipe's is consistent and tasty. I've lost count of how many times I have been here haha. The order process is very straight forward. They ask customers to form two lines that meet in the center where the cashier is located. You tell the employee exactly what you want in addition to any additional items you'd wish to have. The price point is great. I got two baja shrimp tacos for $6.00. My boyfriend got the classic burrito for $5.50. I would recommend trying to locate a table prior to ordering so you have a seat by the time your food is ready. Felipe's is almost always busy because it's in the middle of Harvard Square. There are a lot of students that come in with groups. During the summer, the patio upstairs is open in which you could order drinks or enjoy your meal outdoors.> Felipe's is a machine. The lines are constantly out the door, but they churn out the food as quickly as the line forms. It can feel overwhelming, but don't be discouraged if you see a long line! Just be ready to order your entire order/meal before you get to the register! If you don't, you may have to get back in line as crazy as that sounds. Even if you are dining in, all orders go through the front, they don't offer table service. Felipe's offers a solid menu that is quite affordable for the Cambridge area. We ordered a tortilla salad with fish, two Baja style tacos with shrimp, and a churro. The fish was smaller than expected, but the food was solid overall. I did regret not going for the burrito, because the two tacos are on the smaller side, so keep that in mind depending on your hunger level and the portion size you are looking for. Overall, this is a good option if you're in the Harvard square area. Parking may be difficult, and it will definitely be chaotic inside, but for the price and quality of food it is a solid option! They also have a rooftop area you can go to on certain nights, which is really cool.","4, 1, 5, 5, 4"

Some of the items are hit or miss though. The best items were the short ribs, egg custard tarts and chicken feet. The water chestnut cake and congee were not good at all. There was a lot of seating and we didn't have to wait for a table. Overall, the food was good. There's just something about dim sum and the way they bring out the dishes on a cart that makes it quite the experience for brunch every now and then. I would most likely go again but avoid the food items I didn't like.> Tasty, inexpensive dim sum right in the heart of Chinatown makes for a great Sunday in the city! When you walk in you immediately notice the elaborate decorations -- it's beautiful with lights, flowers and gold and red accents everywhere. I came with a party of 5 around 2pm and was seated within 5 minutes. Upon being seated, we were immediately offered dim sum items off the cart. It really helped having friends that had been there before, because otherwise it would have been a little confusing how everything works, especially for anyone who has never experienced a more traditional dim sum. The staff walk around with different carts -- soup, dumplings, noodles, dessert and you pick as many items as you want off each. Make sure you ask what's on each cart, it's not always obvious. When you do, the staff marks a card at your table keeping track of everything. It's pay as you go, and not a flat price like I've experienced at other restaurants. It is worth noting that you get a lot of food for your money here, so definitely easy to come with a big group and split.Luckily all the tables come with a lazy susan which makes it great to share. We ended up ordering pork shumai, shrimp dumplings, grilled noodles, pork buns, rice with chicken and mushrooms and sesame buns for dessert. It seems like they change up the menu pretty often, but I wish there was a little bit more of a selection on a given day. I also was hoping for a little more variety in the sauce selection than just soy sauce for the table. The food was hot and tasty, but not necessarily the best dumplings and shumai I've ever had.> I'm surprised I never knew about this Dim Sum place as I live about 10 minutes from here but better late than never. Came here with a party of 4 and was seated immediately at around 11AM on a Sunday. What I love about this place is that it's not as big as Hei La Moon, which means that the waiters and servers are much more attentive to your table. Overall the food was really good and didn't taste too oily/filled with msg. We ordered the typical items such as siu mai, har gow, pork buns, and baos, and everything tasted great. My only complaint is that the Shrimp Cheung Fun was primarily rice noodles and did not have enough shrimp. Other than that, I enjoyed my experience here and will be back!> Can't believe how expensive this place was, or maybe they just ripped us off. Came here twice with my boyfriend (used to come here many times in the past), we didn't order anything excessive just the regular dishes. The ""sai mai lo"" aka the coconut tapioca dessert was reduced to half of its original size; I used to order one and be able to share it. Today we had to order two (see photo, the bowl is so small now). The siu mai was overcooked so that the meat was pretty tough/dry. The lai-sa-bao (egg custard bun) was dry in the middle, not runny. Most dishes were too greasy The sticky rice was also way reduced in size and didn't taste fresh. Overall, our lunch came out to $32 per person, with no leftovers to take home. That is absurdly expensive for Chinese food.> China Pearl is a great dim sum place! My group of five came around noon on Sunday and waited for around 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is super efficient, so we were pleasantly surprised by the wait time considering how many people were waiting to be seated when we arrived. We tried a good number of their dishes, including shumai, har gow, sticky rice, chicken feet, congee and you tiao, pork, beef noodles, Chinese broccoli, steamed rice rolls with shrimp, and tofu pudding. (The beef noodles and Chinese broccoli are at a station that's tucked a little inside the restaurant where you go up with your stamp card and pick out your own dishes.)A few things I wanted to note in case I return with a smaller group and have to be more selective about which items to try- the har gow were a little on the dry side, and the shumai were better; the steam rice rolls with shrimp easily beat both of these- the sticky rice was pretty good, but the meat inside was not as good as what you find in the sticky rice you can get at a bakery- things I'd definitely get again: steamed rice rolls with shrimp, Chinese broccoli, congee (with you tiao of course), and beef noodles (also, I'm not huge on chicken feet but apparently these were pretty good)I would definitely come again--China Pearl's efficiency and wide array of options make it a solid dim sum spot! I got swept up with trying all of the different items, so I didn't end up taking many photos, but everything looked as you'd expect.","4, 3, 4, 2, 4"

Prices are reasonable, and the standard Chinese dishes (Cantonese style) are reliably decent. Service is friendly and efficient. The place is small, but seating is comfortable enough. Perhaps the only thing I wish differently, is the parking situation. It's impossible to find street parking (and if you do, go get yourself a lottery ticket because that's your very lucky day). The T (Downtown Crossing stop on red line) is the closest, though it's still a good 15 mins walk.If I'm in the area, I'll surely visit again.> Food is pretty decent. Male servers are friendly. The man in a sweatshirt who I assume is a manager is rude as hell. All of the female servers literally yelled at us. ""Kitchen is closing order now!"" Parties continue coming in for over an hour and are continuously ordering...I ask for a beer well before last call, and see them in the fridge in the way in: no beer. I ask for a bottle of water, and get it from someone else literally 30 minutes later. Even had to get plates and chopsticks for my friends that I specifically said were joining us.Again: pretty decent albeit overpriced food. Atrocious service. We only tipped well because my friend knows some people there. I would've spend another $150-200 on food since we were all starving, and generally tip extraordinarily well since we've all worked in the industry before: they just didn't want my money.There are so many other options. Don't degrade yourself by going here. They rely on volume. Mostly volume of drunk screaming bro dudes and thots.Photos won't  load. I'll update later.> Quality has definitely gone down over the years. Very sad. Need to look for another spot for take out.> My friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant on Saturday night and ordered sesame chicken, scallion pancakes and shrimp fried rice. We were told we needed to spend at least $30 to pay card. When the bill came out to $29.90, my friend put down her card. The waiter brought the check back with an automatic 25% tip. This isn't the worst part though. We ordered a lot, so we decided to take the food home. The next morning, I opened my sesame chicken, only to find a cooked cockroach (covered in sesame no less) at the bottom of the box. It was a fun and disgusting surprise. Safe to say I will not be returning to Peach Farm.> Always good for a late night meal after clubbing hours.. expect a long line around that time , somehow it's always good when you either are tipsy or drunk. One of the best place in Chinatown for authentic Chinese food. Great staffs whose been there forever. We tend to over ordered food everytime when we all lost the battle to almighty liquor that we drank earlier at the club. If you want good food stop by here , can't go wrong here .","4, 1, 2, 4, 1"

I often go with my friends after 10PM for there $2 burger deal for a well deserved study break. They have the deal all day on Mondays, I believe, but we usually haven't studied enough to need a break until Thursdays LOL. The times I've been, they were busy but not so much so that we couldn't get a table for the 4-5 of us. There's plenty of room on the front floor and in the back hall for people to sit at a table and there are standing tables across from the bar area.Environment & Accessibility; the entrance is a paved path off the main sidewalk leading up to a vestibule made up of heavier glass doors with one step (3-5 inches) to get into the restaurant after the second door. Not sure if there's a ramp. The vibe is pretty casual, it can get kind of loud. I like to sit in the back section, it's just a little more private and easier to hear my friends when we're chatting. The TV is also nice and close to see. Service; everyone's usually very nice! I've never had an issue with a server. They remember who we are sometimes and bring me lots of ketchup, hehe. Food comes fast and they'll check up on you consistently. Bill has to be paid by one person, we just Venmo each other afterwards. Food; the burger is super delicious. Meat is the right ratio of juicy with a hint of crunch from the grill and seasoned well, buns are fluffy, lettuce, tomato and pickles are good  I usually add ketchup because I'm an addict but definitely worth the $2.00. You can add cheese ($1) or an egg ($1) or bacon ($1), I usually get mine as is and it's still super delicious. In order to get the deal, you need to buy a drink. They have your regular assortment of pop & a very extensive list of beers, cocktails, ciders, etc. I don't drink alcohol very much so I usually get a ginger beer ($4) which kind of tastes like ginger tea! The wings are okay, I didn't like the sauce we got but I might try it again another time... maybe. The waffle fries are the BOMB!!! So crispy and crunchy, it's worth the $3.50. They also have sea sated fries which were okay, and I've tried the sweet potato tots too which were also good - neither of them compare to the waffle fries, though. Maybe that's just my crunchy fries bias. Overall: Loved it! Will go back over and over again!> The Ave is the quintessential Allston dive. With a plethora of high quality drafts, cheap yet consistently good bar food, and great service, you cannot go wrong here. Plus, they have promotions like $2 burgers and 50¢ wings! It should be mentioned that while it's a dive bar that has that grungy feel, it's really clean and well maintained unlike a lot of other dives. My favorite thing to get here are the dry ciders and the wings--specifically doing a mixed sauce with both buffalo and teriyaki. They're a little bit confusing to order. But trust me, they're amazing. If I'm looking for my dive bar fix, this is my spot, and it'll become yours too. (Pro tip: If you want more prompt and consistent service, I recommend sitting at the bar as opposed to a table, but even with the latter, they don't leave you hanging.)> This is one of the go-to spots in the neighborhood. Much larger than it looks - so good for groups and no waiting. The food is simple and affordable but delicious. Awesome selection of craft beer on tap at decent prices. $2 burgers on Mondays - this must be the best deal in Boston. Super cool and down to earth vibe.> Avenue serves up the best $2 burgers on Monday's.  Requires a purchase of a bevy (either alchy or not)... a great Monday deal! I usually pair the burger with a side order of waffle fries.> No nonsense dive bar with the essential list of beers and the best deal I've heard in a while, a $2 burger when you order a drink. The quality of the burger actually is really good and I was very surprised. It isn't a big burger by any means but it was slightly bigger than a slider. The meat tasted fresh and not frozen and had good seasoning. I honestly expected the burger to be something frozen and tasteless. Overall I'd recommend you check this place out at and get the $2 burger deal!","5, 4, 5, 4, 5"

Have tried better places in the area. Their décor is cool. Serving size is good too. Liked their dahi puri. Overall its average. Their service is good though.> I would say this is the worst restaurant out there in Boston. Ordered from Grubhub as an office lunch and they messed up the order completely. And when you try calling them, they don't even pick up. Almost half of the order was missing and you can't even get hold of them. Grubhub was helpful in refunding but this restaurant is really bad. Overpriced menu and quality is also not that good. I would never ever order from this place again. I have heard firm my colleagues and friends that they known to mess up your order. I would recommend not to eat or order from this place.","5, 1, 1, 2, 1"

I def recommend :)> This place is all around good.I ordered hand roll special but substituted the tuna for extra salmon avocado due to dietary intolerance. Rolls were good. Recommend to eat in, while the nori got a little moist on way home. Flavour was good. Price is very good. Interior of restaurant wasn't horrible. Seems definitely divey. I just expect restaurants to be tidier. Two separate rooms are available for dining.Waited 15 mins for a couple of hand rolls on not a busy night. Friendly staff.I'd go there again for the good sushi deals!> The food was actually pretty good (didn't blow me away), but it was really hard to stomach given the fly buzzing around our table and how dirty the inside of the restaurant was. There seemed to be no upkeep to the inside or outside of the restaurant. Given the good reviews, we figured we had to give it a try, but the negatives just outweighed the positives for me. When it comes to sushi, you don't really want to feel like you're eating from a dingy place. The service was really nice; it really was too bad that I couldn't get past the mental block of the environment. The 2 stars is an average between the 3.5 star food and 1 Star for the ""ambiance.""> Oppa sushi, no doubt, is one of the top Japanese sushi spot to go to in Boston.  My favorite is definitely their specialty maki, which are just out of this world. The fire bruins maki has not only a great taste, but a great presentation as well. The udon size is also huge for its price. There is also sushi boats if you come with a large party. You might miss this place though in Allston center if you don't look carefully since it is halfway underground. Overall> Came here with my BFF. We had noodle and some sushi and appetizer. They also serve drink. The sushi was good and crunchy (we had tempura sushj).","5, 4, 2, 4, 5"

Maybe it was being played ironically :) They are so new they don't have menus printed up so you have to peer around at blackboards to see what's to order - its kind of charming, actually.> It feels weird calling this place a hidden gem when it's actually in a prime location right on Massachusetts Ave, a block away from Symphony Hall. But the restaurant seems to have struggled a bit to find its footing, based on its Yelp page: one early review complains about inconsistent menu offerings; the name and description (inaccurately) refers to the cuisine as a fusion of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai flavors; and even the menu photos seem out of date, picturing ramen bowls and other Japanese-influenced appetizers alongside unique banh mi combos. While the promise of fusion food intrigued me, the mixed messages put off my Vietnamese girlfriend, and we nearly passed over eating here for Saturday brunch.We took our chances though, and left impressed and impressively full. In an ironic twist, this latest (and hopefully last) iteration of Saigon Fusion's menu features no-nonsense Vietnamese specialties--if you're looking for fusion, you're better off going to Pho Basil a block away. We started off by splitting a pate and jambon (ham) banh mi ($7.50) between us as an appetizer, and followed it up with a bowl of pho ($12.50) each. The pho was good and came with high quality cuts of beef, but we both agreed it was the banh mi that stole the show--the baguette was perfectly crusty on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside, and filled with enough well-mixed pate and aioli to make every bite a delight. The surprising lack of pickled carrots and radish didn't even register as a disappointment, since the mix of fresh veggies that were included more than made up for it. The price point is a bit high for Vietnamese food, but reasonable for the area, and again the food is of genuinely high quality. My girlfriend adored the aesthetics of the place too: cute little pots of live flowers served as a centerpiece on each table, the chalk-drawn menus struck a fine balance between artsy and informative, and the music (a lot of classic French love songs) elevated our casual dining experience to just this side of classy. Really loved what they're doing here, and will definitely come again.> I ordered a Chicken Bonmi sandwich. Instead I got some horrible canned meat that looks like cat food! Definitely is NoT chicken. Wtf?!!> We want to love this restaurant so bad, we lived above the restaurant for years so we knew this restaurant very well. The food have improved much since it was changed from sushi restaurant a few months ago, the two girl in front deliver spot on customer service. My only problem is the inconsistency of the menu, we were there the first week they opened, the second week we came back, menu have changed, they don't have the item we wanted to try another or when my boyfriend came back for cold cut baguette (his favorite), they don't have it anymore, yet they have other kind of meat baguette after only 2 weeks of opening, same goes for stir-fry noodles. I used to work in the restaurant business a long time ago so I only guess what is going behind the scene.Overall it's a cute restaurant, have great lunch option, servers is great, food is good, just don't be surprise if you come back and they don't have the items you liked or they change menu again. -Amy smith","4, 4, 2, 4, 3"

Place is 'Halal' and has the best halal burgers in town for sure. Food taste is good but i would definitely recommend trying out there burgers. Serving sizes are very adequate. Major plus is it being open till late. it stays open after midnight for most of the nights. It can be a better place, if the management pays attention on service and cleanliness.> I am not going to lie this place is the hot mess express during lunch.  It gets super crowded with locals and tourists.   The wait for your food can be a tad long.  They offer a mixture of American And Middle Eastern food.> This place never disappoints. Doesn't look like much when you past by but definitely a place to check out. They offer halal catered food. A mom & pop spot where you can come in for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I like to come here for their salmon burger and fries. Delicious. Usually wash it down with a fruit or chocolate chip mint smoothie(cheat day).","5, 1, 3, 3, 5"

Our server was polite.We WILL BE coming back.> I've eaten here in person and it's been fine. I ordered the fig pizza and wings through grubhub. Horrible. The wings were super undercooked, like pink. And the pizza was still uncooked raw dough. So I called grubhub and they told me that ""food orders can sometimes be rushed and may need re heating."" So.... ok first of all no. But I hate to complain so I set my oven for 410 and threw the pizza (wings went in the trash), for 20 minutes. Still fucking doughy. Like this pizza was not cooked at all.  Not trying to eat this. Called again. No refunds available soooooo. I spent 30 on food and enjoyed 0$ of itAnd now being told my order doesn't exist.> We went for lunch, the place has a comfortable feel & commendable space layout.Sat next to front window, felt like we were peering out into a small town setting ( even it's in Dorchester). Very quaint!The Server/ Bartender was Genuinely Engaging,  & was actually Interested in our meal & banter.Had the Bacon-Wrapped Scallops, enough to ignite the palette with a melange of freshly crisp packaging solid shellfish meat....with accompanied tangy aioli.The Mac & Cheese was cascading richness & homemade appeal!Will definitely return to shop around Industry's Menu again. !!Yes!!> Service was good The place was empty I went around lunch time on a Saturday. I had steak tips with asparagus. Everything was very tasty! Sooo tasty I was full and couldn't stop eating My date had the fish and chip. I was told it was really good, and the fish was very fresh.> Overall, unimpressive. The hostess was nice. The waiter seemed confused. The menu was not large, which made me think the chefs perfected a small menu, but instead, the food was bland. The filet was overcooked (medium, not medium rare, it happens) and it was completely unseasoned. It needed lots of salt and I mopped up every bit of the sauce on the plate. The mashed potatoes were awesome and smooth. The string beans were blanched well. The vege burger was just okay. The mac and cheese again, just okay. Everything needed salt and/or sauces to make them better.The view out front is an auto body shop.The bathrooms are plain black and multi stalls.It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great.

We ordered Beef Barg, Beef Koobideh, and Chicken Kabobs. Koobideh was tasty. However, the food was terrible besides Koobideh. This is how Persian food could be terrible: The Barg was not tender and also burnt. The chicken kabob was very dry. The rice was not good either. The portions were very small. For four dishes we paid around $80. Please tell me how much chicken breast cost in the market that the Kabobs are so small. Yes, the restaurant has a French Name, Fiouna !! Yes I get it, French food has smaller portions, that is why it is called Fiouna and that is why the portions are small like French food!!The Beef Barg kabob was burnt at the end and was not tender at all. I have never seen a Persian Restaurant serve burnt kabob. This was a take out and we had guests at home. At home after serving the food for our guests, we noticed this is not enough food for 4 people although we ordered 4 dishes. We were embarrassed serving our guests burnt beef kabob, dry chicken kabob, and small portions. I would not give a second chance to this place. This place proves once again hardly there are any good Persian restaurants in Boston. However if you do not know much about Persian food, this will be fine since you will not know the difference.> Large portion of chicken thigh for lunch. Definitely a good value. Taste wise it's not going to blow your mind but it's satisfying. I recommend here for atakeaway lunch> First time here. Came in for lunch on a pleasant Saturday afternoon. Welcomed with a warm earthy scent of herbs and spices. Ordered the chicken right with the Shirazi salad. There was a very delicious sauce on the chicken thigh and good amount of saffron on the  white rice. I also had the baghlava dessert. Very strong aroma but wish it was sweeter.> Always our to go place when we crave for kababs. Halal and Persian. Their lamb shank is the best. Anything on the menu is worth trying. Portions are large and very filling. Love all their skewers. Bigger platters like Beef Soltani can also be shared among two. There is cheap parking right behind the building.","4, 1, 4, 5, 4"

I was able to sample so many things on the menu and am here to share what my experience was like.Inside was very fancy, I would definitely dress up a little when coming! When my +1 and I were seated, the waiters brought cute mini chairs for our bags, they literally were mini chairs, not the usual hammock type ones. They gave us a wine and food menu, if you want to look at the dessert menu, ask for it now or you might be too full to plan for dessert later!We started off with oysters that were super fresh. Then we got a Dry Ages New York Strip. It was cook to perfection, crispy on the outside, textbook medium on the inside, I can't tell whether it was the knife or the steak but it cut like butter and melted in my mouth after a couple bites! The Bay of Fundy Salmon was a bit dry, but tasty. My +1 and I thought we'd get a Black Forest Basked Alaska Cake, assuming it was going to be a small dessert, as most high end restaurants tend to make them...but we were WRONG. It was hugggeeee and we got so much attention as they lit it! We barely had space for the Double Chocolate cake. We definitely packed alot of the food to go!!The steak here is as great as you'd expect, crispy and not dry, cooked to perfection. As for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Baked Alaska ONLY if you have 4+ people, as most of it ice cream and it literally is that big. We barely finished it with 4 people haha> Super fancy steak house. I'm not a huge meat eater but my filet mignon was phenomenal. I'm a big cheesecake fan and there cheesecake is up there among my favorite. Our server was top notch. I can't wait to go back.> First off, let me start by saying, if you go there, demand that Brendon be your server. Of all the restaurants we've been to, anywhere, anytime, Brendon was absolutely the BEST! Soooooo welcoming, polite, friendly, professional, patient, smiling. When he's at your table, he makes you feel like you're the most important person in the world! (Other employees were amazing too I must say! But we definitely interacted with Brendon the most.)As part of a Yelp Elite Event, we were given $300 to spend for two, and we did, pretty easily I must say. Food is really expensive, but at least, it was really good too. Wine is ridiculously expensive. More on that.So we ordered a dozen oysters, a dozen Littleneck clams for appetizers. Well prepared, clean, fresh, delicious. All but one... Maybe that's the one that wanted to return to the sea so bad in the middle of the night. Who knows... I did set it free around 4 am that night. ;)We ordered the 10 oz ""Domestic Wagyu"" (mixed breed between kobe beef and angus beef) ($98), the 12 oz filet mignon ($68), Buffalo Lobster ($22), asparagus and wild mushrooms as sides. Sooooooooooooo good! The buffalo lobster is kinda like buffalo popcorn chicken, but with lobster instead. The buffalo sauce is so overpowering over the delicate lobster meat, it's almost a shame to do that. Anyway, whatever meat it really was, it was goooood! Both steaks were good, perfectly cooked. The domestic wagyu was amazing! Never had one of those before. Lots of fat, yes, but I guess that's the point. The meat is all marbled with fat, but I must say, the fat was actually good! I loved the taste of it! How can I describe? Nutty? Earthy? Herbal? Wild? It was an amazing experience! Maybe, maybe some day I'll break and agree to shell out $98 again for a steak like that. ;-) For dessert, we had the banana cream pie (or banana somethin', whatever it's called). I never eat dessert, I don't like sweets, I don't like dessert, but I must say, that banana thingy was delicious!! Now THAT would be my kind of dessert! Not too sweet! Just right! And I love bananas! So glad Brendon recommended that dessert for us!! Now, what about the 'wine incident'? Before our table was ready, we were offered to wait at the bar. And, as I felt pressured to ordered something, anything, I thought of ordering a glass of wine. I love love love red wine. So, ok, why not.... I'll have a glass of cabernet. What the heck... Usually goes for $7? $9? $10 at our usual restaurants. I thought to myself, well, this place is a little snobby, so maybe that cabernet will end up being $15? Too much, but hey, open up the wallet!.... That ____ glass of cabernet turned out to be $31!!!! ($29 + tax). Now that's ridiculous. No glass of wine will EVER be worth $31 in my book. No matter how old or how rare it is. I would never ever order a $31 bottle of wine, let alone a $31 glass of wine. Infuriating, I must say. But, we didn't dwell on it too much about it, knowing that we were generously given $300 to spend on everything else that night. Experience learned, for sure.Yes, this place is expensive, one of the most expensive restaurants I've been to, but I would definitely go back on a special occasion. The food and service were definitely worth it! But never again will I buy a glass of wine there. Ever!","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The crepes here come in pretty large sizes for their price which makes it super worth it. I usually get the regular nutella crepe with strawberry and whip cream. It is delicious and great if you have some sudden sweet urges.Whenever I am in the Brookline area and need some dessert after dinner, this is my place.> Disappointed at what should've been an easily great meal..The store is quite small but they make a great use of the space they have. It never feels cramped and is well decorated. I ordered the Nutella Chocolate Crepe with Bananas. It looked pretty and they had free self-serve water (always a plus). There was a ton of Nutella? but it just didn't taste good... I put a question mark because there was a lot of chocolate substance but not much chocolate taste. The crepe also tasted more dough-y than I'd prefer. Not sure if there are different styles of crepes but I just did not enjoy the meal.> People may come here for the crepes, but I find myself stopping by for the delicious smoothies and frappes. A staple in the Coolidge corner area, Paris Creperie stands out by providing some delicious sweet treats in a cozy atmosphere. Every time I come here, the tables are almost all taken, and for good reason! There is a nice selection of both sweet and savory crepes, and a large dessert-y drinks menu. I've had the John Gouda-Man, the Berry Manilow, the Nutella Cannoli, and the Stark Chocolate. The John Gouda-Man is a safe and filling option for a savory meal. The size is big enough for a decent sized lunch for 1 person. Of the 3 dessert crepes I've had, my favorite was the Berry Manilow. It was light and refreshing compared to the other heavy crepes, due to the lemon-poppyseed flavors brightening up the cream cheese and blueberry filling. The Nutella Cannoli was surprisingly good too- it's a rolled crepe with a ricotta and Nutella filling. It is very decadent and heavy though, so be warned The Stark Chocolate is just your standard crepe with a light amount of dark chocolate and raspberry jam. Onto the best part- the drinks. If you are feeling something heavy and chocolatey, I would recommend the Nutella Frozen Hot Chocolate. It is basically a Nutella milkshake with frozen yogurt to provide a thicker texture. Add an espresso shot to add further nuance to the drink. If you are feeling light and fruity, do not fret. Their smoothies are some of the most delicious (although not healthy) ones out there. The Creamsicle is AMAZING. Hands down, most tasty combo of fruit flavors I've had. The acidic flavors of orange and mango are cut down by the milky vanilla frozen yogurt, and notes of fresh strawberries and peaches round out the flavor profile. Some of their other smoothies sound promising as well, but I will find myself going for the Creamsicle again and again.> The service was great here. So friendly. You order at the counter, but then they take it out to you, if you're  eating in. It was busy. We sat at a small table, and took our time chatting over the meal. The place is really conducive to conversation- lots  of people are there with friends. The order was perfect- drinks first, then the crepes shortly after. You grab your own utensils and napkins. The crepe was a bit sturdier than I'm used to- but I think it needs to be that way to hold the fillings, and be a bit more of a substantial meal. I had the crepe with goat cheese, fig preserve, bacon, and arugula. Ooo how I love salty and sweet- did not disappoint! My taza hot chocolate was also delicious, and adorable (see the foam art). Complex, hints of fruitiness, and that stone ground chocolate flavor unique to Mexican hot chocolate. LOVE> Do yourself a favor and check this place out. It is a bustling establishment where people are in and out or eating happily away.The savory crepes only come in full sizes and the sweet crepes come in both full and petite sizes. I opted for two petite crepes: the berry manilow and the bear claw crepe. Holy cow, the berry manilow tastes like the best part of the blueberry muffin, but my favorite was the bear claw. It was filled with cookie butter and came with donut glaze - I need to order a whole one next time!The service here is so helpful and pleasant, I would happily come back.","5, 2, 5, 5, 5"

When I want my churrasco meats and am on a budget, Oliveira's is a great option when in the area. Friday night was packed and there was a huge line at the meat counter that wrapped around the salad bar but it was definitely worth the wait. So many options but I always go for my usual, pincanha sirloin (med rare), spicy sausage, and chicken hearts but unfortunately, they were out or they didn't prepare any ahead of the rush. Disappointing but not the dealbreaker. All meats seasoned well and perfectly textured, and yes, may be too salty for some but that's how Brazilians season their meats! My plate always consists of these meats, rice and beans with farofa on top, salad with beets, fresh tomato, cucumber, and the vinagrette, pickled spicy peppers, fried plaintains, and yucca fries (which they didn't have tonight) and that is what I consider all the essentials. Aside from from great food, the service is excellent with plenty of staff around, prices are affordable, and plenty of parking which is a huge plus for the area. Definitely recommend this place!> Came because of Dine Out Boston for dinner. The waiter never mentioned Dine Out, and charged me their usual full price dinner. Was I supposed to say something? I wasn't aware that it was MY job to do it. I'm disappointed that they are a part of Dine Out and won't even promote it to their customers.Fogo is my go to spot, but I wanted to try something new. Overall here are my ratings:Price: Oliveria'sVariety of meats: FogoVariety of hot/cold sides: FogoTaste of meats: Oliveria'sCheese bread (MY FAVE): Fogo> Came on a Friday with a friend during Dine Out Boston around 2 PM. The restaurant was about a quarter full and we were greeted and seated immediately not far from the hostess stand which is where the hot and cold food bar is located.Our server was an older gentleman who was friendly but sometimes hard to understand. We have both been to Brazilian steakhouses before and though each operate differently, there are some similarities.Something different here was the question ""how do you like your meats cooked?"" ....medium rare we both replied so that dictated the color of the placard left at your table for the server who brings the meats by your table.We proceeded to the hot and cold food bars to get our side and shortly after we were seated,  the first wave of meats started to come by. All together our dining experience included sirloin, flank steak, boneless chicken thighs, lamb, chicken hearts, beef ribs and another cut of beef that we weren't sure about but it was very dry. We saw sausage but never received any. The meats were very salty and mostly overcooked to be medium rare. We were often the first to receive a cut from the stick so the cuts on the outside were usually well (vs rare) cooked.There were some tasty items on the hot bar which included baked cod, stuffed beans, roasted sweet potatoes, ox tail and the rice with beef. The cold bar had a shrimp salad which was very good. Both bars were well maintained and items appeared fresh and not picked over.We were too full for dessert but the dessert case looked well stocked and orderly. $26 for all you can eat at lunch was a fair price. Friendly, attentive service. Glad we tried it but it may be a one and done experience.> Whenever I'm in the Somerville area, I think about you.  You're laid back, you smell good, and you complete me. I'm talking about Oliveira's. The atmosphere is laid back and staff are always welcoming and smiling. The food is absolutely amazing. You can choose All You Can Eat or Pay By The Pound. My go tos are beef fried rice with beans, plantains (MUST TRY), and sirloin steak. This place, no exaggeration, completes me. Guarantee that you'll walk out smiling and satisfied.> Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! What a great experience. The food was great, the ambiance lacked nothing and the staff was quite delightful.Our waiter, Portugal  was a kind older gentlemen who is a historian and knows lots about culture. Every time he came to our table with a smile and had a story, sang a song or shared a fact about Cabo Verde and very nice to the children. A must repeat!","4, 3, 3, 5, 5"

This place has the best pizza around ! You won't go wrong with your typical cheese or pepperoni. But if you want really good pizza, you should spring for the Bostonian (my faaaave) , the Mediterranean, the Boston Supreme Veggie, the Milenza, The Fenway, or the Hay Market. Yes , it's most of the pizza menu. Really , it's all good. If you just get a slice, it's bigger than your face large (equivalent of 2 slices really). They will cut in half if you ask. The subs / sandwiches are great too. I generally get a philly steak or a chicken salad club. They actually make very very good chicken salad meat. The club is gigantic. They give generous portions of fries. The salads are crisp and nice and come with very tasty bread.They know we are all on our lunch breaks so they are pretty quick ! We've had them deliver for meetings and they are always on time.  Very friendly!! If you download the menu you should be able to use one of the coupons. They have a small seating area as with most pizza joints in town. It can get crowded with people standing in line but the line goes fast. Highly recommend!> They can do pizza for Boston in a way that makes sense. As a New Yorker, trying to find pizza around here is basically non-existent. I have walked by here a bunch of times & never really thought much about it, but it actually makes sense to stop in. Thankfully this place has pizza that is better than most around town. We get food catered on a monthly basis & they can always accommodate our  large orders which is great although their delivery area is small. They are super friendly & get us what we need on time which is crucial. These pizzas are ginormous, so be prepared. They also have these homemade cookies that are so damn delicious & huge, can't go wrong getting one of those.> Run of the mill pizza joint serving pizza, burgers and other fast food flare.  Their ceasar salad dressing left a funky after taste in my house. The salad itself was good.  They gave me a lot of meaty pieces of chicken.> We were staying at a hotel nearby and were too lazy to go to a restaurant one night.  We looked up a close place to pick up a pizza and Boston Kitchen Pizza seemed like the best bet.  We called in the order and it was ready for us to pick up quickly.  The pizza was pretty much your average pizza.  I mean even average pizza is good so yes, it was good but it was nothing more than that.> Good cheap by the slice pizza place near Downtown Crossing/Chinatown. This restaurant does have tables to eat your pizza so that was a major plus in deciding to stop here versus other area pizzerias. The pizza slices are huge and maybe next time I'll ask them to cut it in half as I saw many request when ordering. Still, despite the large size the pizza was not too thin or hard to eat. Loved the crust, more doughy than crispy which is just how I like it. Still nowhere near NYC quality but good enough for Boston.","5, 4, 3, 3, 4"

Had The Steak Tips. Really Good. The Irish Mule Was tasty. Definitely Would Recommend This Place....> Came here after work with a group of coworkers and was pleasantly surprised. The Moscow mule I ordered was delicious! I ordered the Greek salad that honestly was a little too drenched in dressing to truly enjoy to olives and feta so next time I'd ask for the dressing on the side but overall the food was great. I ordered the side of rice and the steak tips on the side instead of with my salad and split the salad with my co-worker. The steak tips were cooked perfectly. They were nice and tender. Not slathered in sauce. Everyone devoured their food. Four empty plates and four happy co-workers celebrating the end of the fiscal year! The staff are great and the food is reasonable priced but surprisingly good. The bartender was amazing, skilled as a server and should be commended for holding down the entire bar area, not busy on a Friday but busy enough for a one man show. I'll come back soon.> I was here with some friends for dinner. We ordered apps to share and wine. The male server had a hard time hearing or understanding us even though it wasn't very loud. He seemed more considered with other tables. We got sliders and the loaded tots however no ketchup or other condiments were provided so we asked a female waitress since ours was busy and she seemed annoyed that we would even ask for ketchup. She brought over one cup for a table of 6 girls so we asked for a few more to which she hesitated for a second as if to wonder why we could possibly want more. It was all around uncomfortable service the entire time. The food was good but portions were small for the price. Wouldn't eat here again, but would come for drinks> This place is hit or miss. The steak tips are a huge disappointment, they're very plain not marinated in anything. The flatbreads are either undercooked or overcooked. And the prices are not in line with the quality of the food. If more restaurants were located in proximity on High street this place would be in big trouble.> I was here for a work function.  Had some Guinness, stood around and talked to folks.  It wasn't terribly busy, and were here for a couple hours on a Friday right after work.  This is where the old Brigham's used to be for those of us old enough to remember what Brigham's was...The bar is nothing special - it's all black wood, very dark inside, no real atmosphere or decorations that stood out to me.  We got apps to pick at and they were ok.  It did tend to get a little loud, even though we were the only group there.  This place felt devoid of any real character or anything that would make it memorable.  It's like Generic Boston Bar 101 here.","4, 4, 3, 3, 3"

Food is fresh and flavorful and not greasy like many other Chinese/Cantonese restaurants in town. The space is very clean and comfortable. They even have private rooms for large private parties. Service is also pretty good.Tip: if you like dumplings, get the frozen dumplings to go. They sell 50 frozen dumplings/bag for ~$26, which is a good deal considering the size and quality. I always have some in my freezer for those lazy days.> Based on outer appearance, the restaurant doesn't look like much.. until you step inside. The delicious aroma of Taiwanese cuisine hits you right off the bat. Parking was tough when the lot was filled but its absolutely still worth it to come dine here. They even have this Taiwan beer with all sorts of flavors. The mango is by far my favorite thus far. It tastes very light and refreshing. The food is packed with flavor and everything we ordered was delicious. Some dishes I highly recommend you try is the cuttlefish dumplings, black pepper beef, and the rice cake with crab. The cuttlefish dumplings based on first impressions look intimidating since they use a black dumpling wrap but I'm telling you it is so worth giving it a shot. The black pepper beef is the best peppered beef I've ever tried and that is no joke. It was so incredibly tender and the sauce wasn't overpowering either. Its hard to balance the pepper and they really nailed it here. Overall the food, the service and the ambiance were all on point for me and I would definitely come again. Its also amazing for big groups that want a little privacy. They have 3 partitioned rooms that you have to reserve ahead of time.> tl;dr pretty good option near the Kendall for Taiwanese good, and has cheap+fast delivery.I've been here several times with various friends and have also ordered their food for catering and basic delivery. I love the dishes I have ordered from them, specifically the eggplant with garlic, mooshu pork, Chinese squash. One of my friends really likes their Spicy Fish dish. I didn't like their fried chicken pieces. I was expecting popcorn chicken but the pieces were too small and thin and were more breading than chicken.Their restaurant is decently sized, with tables of different sizes. I don't recall ever having to wait to sit the couple times I went.Delivery wise, they're pretty awesome. The food always comes very fast. The online website order form is a bit annoying to use, but not horrible. When I catered from them, I also had a great experience. Only minor issue would be that their English isn't great, so if they get lost and you don't speak Chinese, you might be in trouble.> I really liked this place. One of the busiest restaurants in Boston, for a reason. It serves up totally legit Taiwanese food in clean and classy Asian venue. It's got a noisy electric vibe which is fun but maybe not the best choice for a quiet romantic date. LOL This is a good choice for a party of 8 - 10 people because you can reserve on of their big tables. We had to wait a half hour or so for a table at dinnertime so walked a couple of blocks to Lamplighter Brewing. By the time the IPA was finished our table was ready and they gave us a call. My phone ran out of battery so unfortunately no pics. Here is how the scoring went:Ginger scallion lobster (1 pounder) $22.95: this was a fabulous rendition of a Cantonese classic. You get a choice of different sauces but the ginger scallion is a perfect complement to the sweetness of the lobster. 5/5Pork and shrimp dumpling $8.95: these steamed dumplings were pretty good. 4/5Pan Fried Dumpling $9.95: AKA ""pot stickers"": these were pretty good also. 4/5Taiwanese pan fried noodle with pork $10.95: this dish was a little bland and greasy, just OK.  3/5Home style chicken (half) $10.95: AKA Soy Sauce Chicken (see yow guy). Another Cantonese classic which was prepared OK but the half order was a bit of a mess with regard to plating and looked like less than a half of a full order. If you get this dish, get the full order. It's a good leftover. 3.5/5Mu Lan Fish $19.95: one of their signature dishes which most customers seem to order. It is SMOKING HOT!!!!! Seriously, even for Sriracha junkies it is hot. Next time I will ask them to make it a lit a little less spicy. 4/5The service is pretty good for a Chinese venue* and I even got a smile from some of the staff. So rare. Ha ah   * Please don't send the PC police after me, I grew up in a Cantonese Restaurant. LOLThis place is crazy busy but one of the best choices for Chinese food in Boston. Get 8 friends, book reservations and you are good to go. It's great for big parties because you get to taste more dishes. Check it out.> This place is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Boston right now. All the dishes I've gotten here so far (I've had maybe 8 different dishes across my 2 visits here) have tasted authentic, well-cooked, and delicious. The beef with leeks wrapped in pancakes is an appetizer that I've ordered both times; I love it when scallion pancakes are combined with other things like an egg or protein. During my most recent visit, we actually ended up getting two Szechuan dishes (crispy chicken with peppers and also shredded beef with peppers). Both were fantastic, though a little spicy.Besides the food, the service is wonderful. Even though the restaurant was crowded on the Friday we went, my group of friends and I (a party of four) were seated not long after we all arrived at the restaurant. The food came out a lot earlier than we expected, and we appreciated how attentive they were with refilling our tea. It was also nice that they filled our bowls with West Lake soup when it was served and also helped us package our food when we said we wanted it to-go. I really want to come back again and try some of their Taiwanese dishes considering how rare it is to find Taiwanese cuisine. I'm sure I won't be disappointed.","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

I was there on a recent Thursday, and given what was going on, was less than impressed. The place was next to empty but they were still charging a $10 cover on a Tuesday to enter.

We didn't order any food since we already ate before, but I'll upload pics of their menu since there aren't many on yelp. Also super cool thing, they have an all gender restroom with multiple urinals and stalls. It doesn't surprise me too much since it is a gay club/restaurant, but it definitely made me happy to see this! Also they have a sign that encourages you to report any discriminatory behavior to the club staff. It's great to see them wanting to create a safe and fun environment for everyone. This is so important in general!I would definitely recommend coming here. The environment is fun, the staff are friendly, and they have awesome events/music.> Went there with some work friends after a team dinner at Fogo de Chao... so we had all eaten a LOT... but the 5 of us got kicked out after 2 of us (who are sis dating) kissed... guess we're not gay enough...?

Decided to stop by here because of the decor. The Victorian Steampunk theme is quite impressive and since they've layered some Halloween decorations on top it gets even better. Arrived Sunday around 11am for brunch. It was me and one regular sitting at the bar. Things really didn't get started until around 1pm here. If you hate crowds come early. Had the Portuguese burger with the hand cut sweet potato fries. A little hot sauce added to it brought it up to perfection. Sampled several different cocktails from the menu, most of them with a coffee theme. All of them were very pleasant.Service was excellent. The Bartender regularly checked up on me and was very friendly. We talked a bit about the interior designer and their choices for the establishment.In summary if you want to hang out at a cool looking place and sip cocktails then this is for you. Food is pretty good as well for this type of establishment.> What can I say about this place? From my experience, my food was not good at all. And I had a burger. Drinks were great, staff were nice too. It's street parking, expect to drive around on busy nights.> Went for lunch and the food was pretty good -- I ordered the chicken burrito (very good), french fries and a bagel. The service was terrible though. We waited 20min before we even got our drinks, and probably another 30min for the food. They had one server running to all tables (who was very nice and doing her best), but just awful organization altogether. Definitely won't be returning.> Sixth Gear had great food. The tacos were pretty large, we got them as an app but they would also be a good size for a meal. The fig pizza was also very good. I came in at 7 on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet. This would be a good place for a group or just a casual date night. I would definitely come back here. My lack of a fifth star is because it's not as great as some other places in southie, and our draft beers were funky tasting.> Stopped in to eat with a family friends for the 1st time and enjoyed the atmosphere... from the hostess to waitstaff they are very friendly and inviting... the food was good and the desert was awesome.... well worth giving a try","4, 2, 2, 4, 5"

The Platos now come with rice(i know some yelpers complained about not having before)...everything is authentic and to die for! i'm drooling/contemplating if i shd hear over there now as i type this> I had wanted to go to this place for weeks since it opened, and finally got to go. I'm a huge fan of the owner's other restaurants, and thought the photos on Instagram looked amazing.Unfortunately, it was a subpar experience.I ordered a steak quesadilla and for some reason it was sopping wet. I wasn't sure if it was from the salsa or from the steak's juices, but I had to flip it over (wet side up) in order to eat it without it falling apart. My companions got tacos and said they were fine but nothing amazing. The place was also empty on a Saturday night around 7, so maybe that should have tipped me off.> I work close by and this place is a nice addition.  Small menu, but that's alright since when you do fewer things, you can do each better.  I think Gordon Ramsay said something like that once (but it was more like ""YOU BLOODY #@#!$ and %@!&# BOLLOCKS!!""...or something along those lines).   Anyway, good food. Admittedly sort of on the slow side, especially during the lunch rush, so if you only have a half hour for lunch, don't chew, just swallow.  On the bright side, because everything is made fresh to order, you forgive them and get over it.I usually do two pollo tacos; one corn, one flour.  Good stuff! Love the fresh cucs  and lime. Yummers! I haven't tried anything else yet, because I'm boring, but will soon.Update 1/29/20 - After I raved about this place to a friend (who doesn't want an account on Yelp), she went a few times and liked it. However, the other night she sent me pics of an ordered delivery.  She purchased a family meal that was supposed to feed 4 people for about $40, including 4 burritos, 8 flautas and chips for all. I don't know if it was late in the day and they didn't care anymore or what, but they inexplicably and inexcusably sent her family 3 or 4 burned crunchy burned chunks of chicken in dry flautas broken up into randomly sized pieces, a bag that she counted literally had 13 tortilla chips in it and not 4 burritos, but 2 small, dry flat burrito-like things, cut in half. All of this was supposed to feed her family of four. I think she got a refund from the delivery carrier, but the false advertising made us all pretty sad. Not cool, guys! Gotta bring my stars down to 2.5/3 for the inconsistency. See the pics to see what she got.> I'd give Taqueria el Barrio a 3.5 but since Yelp doesn't allow that I have to round down for the series of price increases. I went during opening week and grabbed a fish taco and a vegan chorizo taco. The vegan chorizo is LIT--spicy and packed with flavor. But, balancing that out, the fish taco was super dry and overcooked. I was able to overcome the dry fish by adding extra salsa--there's a station after you order where you can load up more from mild to spicy. As other Yelpers have commented, when this place opened you could get tacos for under $3 and it was a steal at that price. Now that the prices have gone up, it's  hard to get out of there for less than $10. If I'm spending $10 on tacos, then I'm going to zip on over to Lone Star instead.> It hasn't even been 24 hours since I came to Taqueria el Barrio but I just HAD to write a review as soon as I could. I came here last night for dinner because my boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place since it opened. There was surprisingly no one in the restaurant since I've seen plenty of people outside eating after we go to the gym. We were greeted by the workers and decided to just get tacos. I had the asada and the pescado, while my boyfriend had two of the al pastor. They also offer four different types of salsas, which are self-serve, in which I got the salsa verde and the chile secos, both light-medium hot spice level. Now let's taco 'bout the tacos. AMAZING. The asada taco was probably one of the best and most flavorful taco I've had in a while. It was loaded with cilantro, onions, and guac, which all of the other tacos have as well (unless stated other wise). The pescado taco was also locked and loaded with salsa and a chipotle mayo. I loved everything combined as it was just so flavorful and tasty. Putting the salsa verde and the chile secos was just a cherry on top. None of the meats were dry and I just loved how everything pulled together. Being a native of Southern California, tacos hit very close to home when I'm away. A lot of places in Boston charge $6+ for ONE taco and they are usually bland and not authentic. Taqueria el Barrio is definitely one of the few that tastes like my favorite taco spot in SoCal, which is great! I love this location as it is literally right in front of the T, so it's convenient for many people. They also have a variety of tortas, tacos, quesadillas, and plates, along with churros! I am very pleased that I finally found a GOOD spot for tacos and I can't wait to be back!","5, 2, 3, 3, 5"

The elevators on the first floor of the Marriott was fun, you click on the floor you want to go to and an elevator with that floor number will appear :) Once you get off the elevator, Champions is right around the corner on the second floor! Right behind the host, you can see a long semi round bar with a long line of tvs for catching up on sports! My foodie partner and I were seated in a semi private area, super comfortable area for taking pictures and trying everyting, definitely felt like VIPs.They gave us the menu of selected items for us to try while we are there. The appetizers and drinks came out first. The nachos come in a huge platter, super worth, my favorite thing about this dish was the salsa, which was very well flavored! The shrimp were picture perfect! Next came 4 drinks, the 2 of us sampled all of them and in the end, Ip-Loma and Hit the Road Jack were our favorite ones :) glad we got to try all of them!The entrees came next. The buffalo chicken salad was massive!!! Also came with bacon ;) the fish and chips were delicious, looks like London fish and chips! The chipotle chicken was super tall and the amount of guac in it was UNREAL! The key lime pie was beautifully plated. It had the perfect balance of sweet and sour, neither overwhelming the other :) Overall, we had a really great experience! We appreiciate the invite and would definitely bring our friends over!> Whoa!!! What a night! It started with me wanting to watch the Celtics against Miami Heat. The game started at 8pm and I arrived at 7:30. I sat in the middle lounge after asking the waiter if it was ok. 20 mins went by..then 30. No service!. This is after making direct eye contact with servers. Finally decided to go up to the bar. Friendly old man sitting next to the only free spot. It seemed ok. He was very friendly. Offered to buy me a drink even though I said it was ok. Traveler from Chicago...on a work conference.He seemed ok but a bit too inquisitive. Conversation started easy enough but later revealed he would like some company up in his hotel room with a bottle of champagne. So much for a innocent friend! He was very pushy. I ended up having to text a friend and have her call me to pretend to be in a car accident and need help Asap. The only savior of the night was he paid for all my food and drinks as I ran away.All in all if I had just received service at my original seat non of the unpleasantness would have happened. Will definitely not ever return.> I had a great lobster roll and chowder at Champions for lunch today!  I am a New Englander now in Florida, traveling in Boston for work and always seek out good New England seafood.  Grabbed lunch when I checked in, loved the lobster roll!  Coming from Maine I am a real purist when it comes to a lobster roll. Lobster, a little bit of mayonnaise, a little bit of lettuce, on a toasted hotdog roll. No celery no paprika, nothing else. Keep it simple!> One of the better and more modern Champs I have come across during my Marriott stays.  Clearly a great spot to watch your fave team given the myriad of wrap-around TV's.Food was just ""ok"", and we also drew the wrong end of the bar with a couple bartenders clearly not working as quickly (or as hard) as some of their counterparts.  But again, if you're here for the games it really is a good spot.  Stick with beverages and hit elsewhere after the game for food.> The cocktails are solid, the wings are delicious and so is everything else I've tried. Its nothing fancy, but if you want a tasty, inexpensive, casual spot to eat in a sea of more expensive options, this is a really good bet. It's also a great place to watch the game! If you've got a party of four or more try the Champions Tower of appetizers!","5, 1, 4, 3, 5"

It is Downtown at Milk and Kilby every Thursday and the price for the quantity of delicious, flavorful food is unreal! I got a Bulgogi Pork Noodle Salad ($7.99) with a side of Kimchi ($3). Foremost, noodle salad was amazing, meat well seasoned - forewarning: they put the gochujang sauce on the food for you so if you can't take heat or want to control the amount, ask for it on the side! Skip the Kimchi side. I was really excited because it was a legit full portion, container you can get from a grocery story (think cream cheese sized container), but it wasn't that good. Not sure if it's home made or actually is store bought.Kimchi aside, can't wait to try the Rice Bowl, the Sandwich, and the Bibimbap!

I took the box back to my office, opened it, only to find that there's no bulgogi beef in it!!! Not a single slice of it at all! Only rice, veggie and a fired egg. I didn't have time to walk all the way back for a change and yet I decided I'll never go back ever :(The seemly small and accidental mistake made by whoever prepped the box is not okay at all, coz that means someone is gonna suffer from starvation over a busy & intense afternoon :(This is probably one of the worst lunch I've ever had :(> This truck was a pretty good find! It's a little bit of a walk from my office downtown but worth it. You really get so much food for the price point. I got the classic box with bulgogi pork and rice. Everything was delicious. My only complaint is that the rice  oils have been a little softer and the egg was overcooked. However, will definitely come back! Great lunch find.> Solid lunch option with decent flavor and serving size, but just some thoughts on how it could have been so much better, coming from a Korean very familiar with the original Bibimbap.Rice had a lack of taste, was dry and overcooked. For bibimbap, rice is made with a different strand than this one, and made more moisture typically so it can be properly mixed and maintain the silky moist texture, instead of separating in your mouth so you just have dry undercooked rice left in your mouth towards the end. This strand works well with something like curry, because curry has all of that moisture and flavor already.Using ground beef to call it a special seasoned beef and charging extra for that - not a fan. I really expected the boolgogi to be there instead. Would have rather had different meat options if I knew it was cheap ground meat.The pre-cooked and going soggy fried egg that also had no seasoning felt like a minus to me. Otherwise, the vegis were all there, had the sauce had good modified flavor for the general audience, etc.!Hope some improvements are coming, really felt like it was so close to being that perfect place to always want to go to!> I visited this truck for the first time today on Stuart St . It is a must-try if you work in and around Copley/Back Bay station.  Classic bibimbap was on point but they also have salads, rice, and noodle bowls with vegetarian and vegan options.  Fresh ingredients, tasty, and reasonably-priced for the area (most dishes are under $10).  Service was quick and friendly.

Right ratio of meat and al dente pasta.  This is my new go-to dish here.  Farfelle Limoncello: 4/5 my friend liked the flavors but wasn't a big fan of bow-tie pasta and wanted a tad more shrimp.  You can't really go wrong for a casual dinner here.  Prices are fair and portions are pretty big.  I had a lot of pasta left over, despite how hungry I was, and there was enough for dinner the next day.> This is a typical and very average Italian restaurant in Back Bay.  It is not bad, it is not great, it is as Yelp has it for 3 stars, ""OK"" - I think the overall score and the general feedback in all the reviews is pretty spot on, so good job Yelpers. Ambiance is ""normal"" for a Boston Italian joint, they aren't trying too hard to be something they aren't.Service was ""okay"" - the waiter wasn't Mr. Charisma, and he wasn't missing-in-action, he did what he needed to do and moved on with his life, which I can respect.Food was hit and miss, some people in my party ordered pizza (this I would NOT recommend), and it was flaccid and chewy and tasteless, but what do you expect?  Some people ordered the pesto pasta, which was good and probably something you should stick with (pasta I mean).  The appetizers like the charcuterie were just okay, again nothing crazy but not horrible. It fills you up, it checks the box, and it doesn't break your bank.  3 stars sounds about right to me.> Serafina is always good, just not anything special. A lot of my friends go here as a ""go-to"" but they're not foodies like me, this is just all they know. A friend and I went here because we knew there was no wait (mid-day on a weekend) and we were in the neighborhood.This location is casual for sure...more than the other Serafina near the financial district. The food always tastes good and the service is usually good as well. Their truffle dishes are the best- that's usually my go-to. For a good Italian meal, come here, but if you can (or if you want REALLY good Italian), go elsewhere.> Came here for a friends birthday dinner and it was super nice; our waitress was super on top of it, really kind, and made sure our water glasses were never empty. Serafina is actually her favorite restaurant! I had walked past this restaurant many times on Newbury Street, but never really noticed it to go in. I'm glad that I've tried it out now, the food was definitely delicious. They gave us a nice basket of bread to start with which is always appreciated. My friends loved their penne alla vodka, and the chicken salad I ordered was also very yummy. All in all, it didn't stand out to me that much, but nonetheless, it was a solid restaurant to eat at and try for the first time.> The $4 mimosas drew me in, but they yummy charcuterie and awesome bartender made me stay. Truly we were going to stop in for a quick drink while on our very quick trip into Boston. But we quickly realized how great this place was. Yes $4 mimosa are amazing, but great conversation and CHEESE! Very reasonably priced for Newbury St. Will need to pop in on my next visit to Boston.","4, 3, 3, 4, 5"

Do not order or eat here. Ordered a side of meatballs and italian sausage, and both arrived looking identical like indistinguishable, burnt leather meat that smelled and tasted like fish, which was so foul. Do not waste your money.> For $17 I thought it was a little overpriced. I know it's located in the South End. Food in this area is overpriced, I'm not surprised. The pasta was good & flavorful. But for the price you're better off going to a restaurant. If you're in a hurry & don't mind spending money. I would go here! For a place that chargers a lot, giving random recycle bag is cheap.> The pasta at Blackjack is soooo delicious.  Our family ordered Cajun chicken and shrimp Alfredo, meatball sub, angel hair with pink sauce, garlic and cheese ravioli with pesto, garlic and cheese bread, and finally the fried dough bites!  Every single thing was amazing!  This is true comfort food and we couldn't help but share with each other.  I highly recommend the garlic bread with the Cajun chicken and shrimp Alfredo.  I love that all of the food is made fresh to order!  Staff had all the food ready in less than 10 minutes.This food most definitely hits the spot and we can't wait to come back!> I've ordered twice now via Postmates so far my dishes have been mediocre. I have tried the lasagna, the carbonara,  and now the angel hair pasta with eggplant Parmesan sauce. I also ordered a Greek salad which was a nice large portion. I also decided to order some homemade garlic bread that arrived overcooked and tasted like a burnt crouton. I think this will be my last experience dealing with them.  There are too many Italian places in Boston to try if this is what I've gotten on both of my tries. Meh","4, 1, 4, 5, 3"

I was still hungry after eating it but maybe that is attributed to me not eating since the day before. The girl behind the counter was friendly and the sandwich took probably 10 minutes to put together.

Well that happened to me today and it was Roy's to the rescue. Even though I was lugging my rollaboard behind me, I made the brief detour from the Airport MBTA station to Roy's and got my sub. Roy's is take out only with a long counter and a bunch of coolers of sodas and drinks, but tables to eat here. I brought my sub back with me to the airport but didn't want to risk the TSA ""confiscating"" it, so I ate it at one of the tables in the airport.Very nicely packed, very delicious, the sub was well packed with proper sized meatballs, sauce and cheese. Excellent.The inside of the shop is very cool. Very well decorated with all sorts of rock and roll nostalgia, pictures of (I assume) Ray with rockstars as they've come through town and all sorts of other neat stuff.

PERFECT FOR CHRISTMASTIME because the ambiance is warm, beautifully appointed and, as the lobby of the Ritz Carlton, buzzy and full of cheer. There is a sleek fireplace on one wall, and great entertainment too. The bartenders crafted several holiday dessert cocktails which were divine. The wine list is well curated, too. Four stars because seating is limited and not as comfortable as the setting is inviting.> Soft opening was on 10/11/19 after renovation and making more space for seats. The bar is on the wall side not in the center anymore. Waiter and waitresses were very kind. Although the look of the fireplace and couches is very luxurious and gorgeous, but sitting here in not comfortable. I mean chairs and sofas are not meant for comfort. I always wonder why couches designers do this. It's not hard to design a comfy couch. This bar area and seats are the main lobby for the Ritz Carlton hotel. So it's designed more for people who come to drink more than the hotel patrons.  The dessert was so clean, perfectly small portion and very good. The water was delicious. The honey was amazing.> The room and music is why i gave 2 stars. the drinks were ehh. The food was microscopic and fair. What a great disappointment. I live in the city and im very disappointed. Save your money and go elsewhere> Avery Bar is sexy. Located in the lobby of the Ritz Carlton, the bar is horse shoe shaped, behind a fireplace. There are also tables and chairs if you prefer.The cocktail list is rather limited. It is called the ""Avery 10"" so there are only 10 cocktails. The cocktails are very well crafted though. I had no. 6, the harvest mule, which is a moscow mule. It was very well done. I also tried no. 2- gin & juice. you get a bottle of Hendrick's and a small pitcher of juice, and you mix the 2 together. Each cocktail is $15 a pop, definitely Ritz-Carlton prices.We were served mixed nuts and mustard pretzels. Those were delicious! Overall, a really nice bar that is pricey.> Cozy, modern, and for now what feels like a hidden gem in the Chinatown/Downtown area. Located in the Ritz-Carlton lobby, which means free WiFi for all. The specialty cocktail and food menu need a bit of developing (seemed a bit too ""old world"" for me--not every cocktail needs dark liquor and bitters, thanks) and the beer selection is kind of lame, but it's such a lovely space to spend time in that you'll be willing to overlook these things.

I would come back for restaurant week but probably not any other time because of how expensive it is normally. The food wasn't terrible but it just wasn't amazing. I personally didn't like the popovers that they first bring out but my boyfriend enjoyed them. I ordered the hanger steak and he ordered the skirt steak. I ordered mine medium and maybe that was my mistake because it was a little too tough still for me. He ordered his medium rare and I thought it was really good. The greens and fries on the side are a nice touch, I really enjoyed the crispy fries. As for dessert I really enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding. Would recommend that one over the almond one my boyfriend got. Overall, this place is good but nothing spectacular. The atmosphere is nice and the service was decent, but again, just nothing special. Definitely recommend for restaurant week, though!> Very disappointed! I've been to the South End location several times and always had positive experiences so I expected the same at the Downtown location. My friends and I had a reservation for Friday and as we arrived we were asked to wait an additional 15 minutes although the restaurant was empty. We waited awhile for our server so we asked the host and he finally made his way over. The server did not offer us complimentary bread while we waited. The food took a very long time to come out. We only saw the server twice during our dine-in (to take our orders and deliver the bill).> I came in a party of four on a weekday evening for dinner. It was very crowded, luckily we had a reservation.I ordered the lobster ravioli, 10oz filet mignon, and the chocolate almond cake. The lobster ravioli was super delicious and flavorful! I wish it came with more raviolis! The sauce around the raviolis was also very savory and tasted great with the lobster. The filet mignon was very delicious! The meat was so rich and tender. The middle was perfectly pink! The almond cake tasted good after I removed the cherry layer. The service was pretty slow, and the food took a long time to come out. When the waitress was over, she was very friendly and helpful.Overall, we had a great experience and I definitely recommend this restaurant!> I had the day off today and was excited to go out to lunch with my mum. We've both never been to this steakhouse and was eager to try the food. My mum is a person who loves to eat beef, so I'm alway happy if I can find a great steak place for us to go to. Looking at the menu, we both decided to go with the 2 course power lunch. The options for the power lunch sounded appealing and we both ended up getting the lyonnaise salad, mum had the prime steak tips au poivre, and I went with the filet mignon.The lyonnaise salad, was very tasty. I enjoyed the bacon and the mushrooms. However, here are 3 pitfalls of the salad. One, the 2-hour egg on my salad, did not exist. It was a quarter of an egg white and no yolk. Basically, the egg was missing from my salad. (FYI, the picture of the salad was my mum's). Two, I ended finding an egg shell in my salad. Three, the parsley leaves needed to be cut down and sprinkled in my opinion. The parsley leaves were left as big leaves in the salad and I found that very unappealing. Though the salad dish obviously lacked in some qualities, overall was good.The beef dishes though was much better. Mum and I both enjoyed greatly our steak dishes and was very happy with the cook on the steaks. Also, our waiter Ricky was wonderful. He checked in on us and always kept our waters glasses full. I have yet to decide if I would want to come back again.","5, 3, 2, 4, 3"

Love when they make it with fruit loops!Overall, a must if you're craving a hearty meal!> Great grilled cheese. Amazing poutine! I ordered the regular three cheese because that's what I was in the mood for, and plus I wanted to see how they do their classic. It was exactly what I wanted. Nothing fancy, just yummy melted cheese. It might be a little over-hyped. But it's still good! The soup is alright. Of course it goes well with the sandwich but I wouldn't get it again. It was roasted so maybe that's what I was tasting but it sort of had a canned flavor to it. Wish it had been brighter tasting instead. The poutine tho! It is so good and it has the proper amount of gravy. Don't skip out on it!! Oh and portions are good. Pretty big but not unreasonable.> I LOVE Roxy's! We stopped in on our way back from the MIT museum. Roxys has a great selection of burgers, hot dogs, and grilled cheese. They even have many vegan options!

The business does NOT offer straws which is awesome!> The double fried chicken sandwich was exactly what I needed after a double header of workout classes at Heartbreak Hill next door.

I decided to try it out one Friday and got the regular classic sandwich with truffle tater tots. Overall, the taste and texture of everything was pretty good! The 3 cheese mixtures blended well together and the bread was toasted to a buttery perfection. The tater tots held up their structure and were seasoned well too. Only thing is I feel like this is something really basic that I can just make at home and I can justify paying $6 for something that's basically just toasted cheese and bread. Don't get me wrong, this place is good but just not anything special for me. If anything, I would order one of their specialty sandwiches for something less basic and worth my money.","5, 5, 5, 5, 3"

The natural charcoaled flavor is just great. Even though I asked for the steak tips to be well cooked, they are not dry but juicy and tender! The garlic flavored mashed potatoes is not too garlicky so I don't have to worry about the smell. The string bean is a bit under cooked as it is just too crunchy for me. My husband ordered fish and chips. But his is definitely not good. The fish might have been fried too long, not crispy, but a bit burned and doughy. The chips are good though, thick, crispy outside but not dried out. It goes well with the mayo which we asked.For some reason, the clam chowder we ordered was never brought until the waitress came around asking if we needed anything else. I reminded her about the clam chowder. She then brought it. It was actually pretty good, fresh, hot, and with the taste of homemade.It is a good busy restaurant all in all.> I came here for dinner to use my Priority Pass $28 freebie (between 2-8PM) before a flight. Tried the fried haddock tacos which were perfectly crispy but a tad salty. However the accompanying pico and avocado was refreshing, and I appreciated the generous portion size. I also inhaled the clam chowder which was thick, creamy, and chock full of seafood. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, and it's probably the best food in the airport (however this is located pre-security so plan ahead). Service was lacking though since I was sitting at a high top table and being assisted by the bartender. Can't complain too much though since the meal itself was free. However I do not think I'd come without Priority Pass though since the prices are pretty steep overall.> Okay for an airport restaurant. Beer selection decent, food is mediocre. Prices are a bit on the high side. Unfortunately it's before TSA security so if you're there on a layover you have to exit and then get screened again by those wonderful folks at TSA. And everything TSA is so inconsistent from airport to airport it's mind boggling. I wonder if TSA has a manual or Standard Operating Procedures for their people. Lastly, I wish this restaurant knew how to spell ""Brussels Sprouts"". It's not ""Brussel"", it's Brussels. Come on guys, you're in the food business.> Like many airport places, I wouldn't come here unless you have priority pass (priority pass gets you $28 if you come between 2-8PM).Clam Chowder: Incredibly overpriced at $11 (above and beyond what you'll find even at a tourist trap like Quincy Market). Tasted good, thoughTempura Calamari: Comes with a pretty nice tartar sauce. Pretty tasty and well seasonedSteak Tips: Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was a little too sweet and completely well done (I asked for medium). The green beans and mashed potatoes were okay, though. You can tell the meat is pretty low quality, which would be fine except this dish was around $18.I guess I could expect as much, but everything is insanely overpriced here. The food is good enough (as in it is all edible), and I'm not complaining since I got it for free... the waitress seemed very busy with all the tables, but she was very courteous.> Bad service and long waits but food is ok. Used our priority pass here for 3 people. It's landside and they take quite a while so only come here if you have time to spare. You seat yourself, it's a bit disorganized. We were sitting for a while before anyone brought us menus. Our server was not good and made me upset...see below for the full experience. We got a Sauvignon blanc and Boston tea party cocktail (sweet tea and vodka, pretty strong). Food took a long time to come out.- Calamari: underseasoned but overall not too bad, peppers were nice- Chili: loaded with a super large scoop of sour cream and cheese, chips on the side were a bit stale. Tastes like chili out of a can but not horrible- Steak salad: steak was cooked pretty well but good flavor and overall the salad was good, solid choice- Southwestern salad: okay, nothing specialOverall, the food was about what I expected for a priority pass restaurant. I was fairly pleased until the end then I just got annoyed. The service could've been a lot better, considering that it's an airport and people are on a time crunch. Bad service--Our server never even asked us when our flight was or anything. It took a very long time to him to bring our check out. We had our priority passes on our phones so he had to take our phones to the counter I guess. We would've just given him our cards if it was such a hassle. He just really did not seem to care about giving good service. Our whole meal took about an hour and a half. Given this and our server's apathetic attitude, we did not provide a generous tip. The one time he actually paid us any attention was when we were giving tip. He eyed the exact amount we gave and proceeded to tell us what the customary amount should be in front of everyone. Wow. I've never had this happen before and was shocked at his audacity. I believe that tip is something that is earned for good service. If you don't provide good service, you don't get a good tip. I'm sorry but that's how it works, at least for me. I would've put up more of an argument if we had more time but obviously we spent all of our free time waiting for our food and check. Ugh. TL;DR: Food is ok, only come if you have priority pass and tons of time to spare. Don't expect good or even friendly service.","4, 3, 3, 3, 2"
Dok Bua Thai Kitchen,Brookline,4.0,2,Yes,Yes,Yes,dokbuabrookline.com,Thai,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,11:00 am - 9:30 pm,Null,Null,"I love how many options Dok Bua has on their menu. They really have a variety of dishes and even have dinner specials where you get to try a few things like an egg roll, soup, rice, and a main entree within a reasonable price (less than $11). I ordered the Indonesian Fried Rice, which was seriously so flavorful. The rice was flavored with this spicy&sweet sauce that distinguished it from a regular fried rice that you get typically. The rice had a slight sticky consistency to it as well. On top of the rice, it was covered with crispy chicken which was as crispy as the name implies! Loved my dish I ordered - you can't go wrong with the Indonesian Fried Rice. In addition, one of their best selling points is how it's BYOB (bring your own beer) with no extra charge. It's a very casual vibe. Because of this, my friends and I were able to bring our own Trader Joe's wine and still enjoy the food here. Like I was saying, the menu is long and there were so many other items like their Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup, or Thai beef noodle soup that I'd like to come back for! Definitely one of my current favorite Thai places in Boston now.> I believe owner changed. And it's not good. Sad. It's a sad day for me. I hope you find this place to be better than what I have experienced today. I have been a faithful customer of this place where they started as an Asian and Thai grocery store that became a restaurant, 15 years or so. Some of you might know they used to have commercial refrigerates against the walls. It was our family sit down feel good and tasty Thai food place for many years, but it won't be any more.I ordered two orders of Thai fried rice with beef. It was bot tasty at all. The portion was so uneven that my dish was just enough for my 7 yo daughter and that 'a small. Just very small amount of rice and lots of onions and scallions that were not cooked and to make thing worse the beef was rubbery and it was clearly a frozen beef thawed without marinate nor seasoning. How do you mess up a fried rice in a Thai place? But they did and my wife didn't even finish Pad Thai because it was simply not tasty. She said it was just wet. Lastly, men's bathroom was dirty and smelly and the dishwashing areas was  just as smelly and dirty.  Prior owners had the bathroom clean and dishwashing area was always clean.  The toilet bowl was dirty. Inside and outside, trash can was dirty filthy. Now. I think I will stop here. Tempted to post bathroom pic but didn't. Thank you for reading.> Ordered takeout and ate about 45 mins later and the food was still good! I got the pad thai, fried rice with pork, red curry, crispy chicken basil, and water spinach. It came to around $70 which is crazy (especially since I know what this stuff costs IRL in Thailand) but eh, it's Brookline. I was most impressed by the curry and the fried rice with pork. The pork in the fried was pork belly which is delicious to begin with. The curry was smooth and rich. The other dishes were pretty standard. Nothing wrong with them, but also nothing particularly special about them.> I started coming here about 8 years ago. I remember after I had it once, I ended up coming back every day that week. I don't know what they put in their food, but it's addictive like crack! I normally get the pad Thai but I wanted to try something else and ordered their grilled pork fried rice. Omg, equally addictive. The grilled pork was marinated thoroughly and fried rice with the egg was moist. Their Thai iced tea is definitely the best I've had! I wish this was near my home. I'll probably be there 7 days a week.> Had the best Thai takeout from Dok Bua that I am itching to try a sit down meal there too! What caught my interest is how vast their menu is. Got Moo Yang - this flavorful saucy grilled pork - and Chicken Rice Soup to start. Both of these were delicious and signaled great things for our entrees.I got the Yum Woon San Salad because it's my way of eating healthy (it's a salad...made of noodles!). Ground pork, shrimp, peanuts, chili sauce & lime - what's not to love. The Boy got the Chicken Fried Rice Dinner Special & he loved. If you spend a certain amount you have your choice of a free app or another (grubhub) too so that was nice. 10/10 will be eating Dok Bua again!","4, 1, 3, 5, 5"

Well, I actually stumbled upon this place. I was recommended to go to ""Howl at the moon"", but it wasn't my vibe. I was looking for something with a little bit of culture, something my speed. Looked up some reviews and saw this good be the place for me.This club was fire! You want culture come here. They played Latino music, afrobeats, hip hop, trap music, etc. I paid a $15 cover charge and got there around 11:45pm. Also, they have $5 mystery drinks (which is a plus)... You're also free to come and go as you please, they'll give you a stamp on your wrist.So, why not 5 star? Although, it was lit and people were absolutely wonderful... people were wild bro. At some point I couldn't dance anymore because we were packed like sardines. Then, these fools started mosh pitting and I was ready to fight, lol. No one was keeping a check on these people. On a serious note: come to sweat, get drunk and have an good time.> I'm reviewing solely based on ordering lunch from here via the Ritual app. I searched Ritual for tuna poke because, well, I love fresh tuna and could eat it for every meal. Imagine my surprise when Good Life popped up on the list for tuna poke bowls. I was a little reticent to order it, but I really wanted some tuna poke and I decided to give it a try. It may have also been 5x the points on Ritual and I'll do almost anything for a free meal...so there's that.Guys - this was really good! My only complaint is that the rice is often a tad crunchy. I can't tell if it's underdone or maybe even a tad overdone. I've ordered this dish a few times now and I keep coming back because honestly the tuna is super fresh and the sriracha mayo they serve with it is addictive. There are delicious slices of avocado and mango and it's all super fresh. Seriously, wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. A downside, it's $15.00 and that's pretty steep for a lunch...even in downtown Boston. However, the price point hasn't stopped me from ordering this dish multiple times.> Great spot to pop in for lunch, dinner, drinks, etc! During the day it was filled with people having lunch and enjoying each other's company, which is always nice. The wings were delicious, the Mac and cheese was simple but tasty, and the short rib sandwich was a nice flavor. The tuna poke bowl was really delicious. Not the traditional poke bowl, but really filling yet light none the less. Drinks are definitely on the stronger side, and cocktails are $12. Service was great, attentive without being overwhelming. Overall, a good spot to stop in for a bite and some good company!> To be black in Boston is to find it VERY difficult to find clubs or bars to cater to you. This being said:  The food is good bar food and I often go with my friends to grab a bite after work. Depending on when you go, they have a cover of $0-$15.This is as close as it will get to basement vibe parties. If you remember going to house parties where it was dark and you could have fun and dance, this is for you. I would go online and check to see if they have a guest DJ which did happen once and it was the worst night. This was an isolated event though. There is a bar in each room. There are two rooms on the first floor and one room in the basement. The first floor is always playing throwbacks and major hits that anyone can enjoy. The basement plays top 40, afrobeats, reggae, hip-hop, r&b, etc. There is something for almost everyone.You can show up dressed in pretty much anything so I've gone dressed up or dressed down. You can get in with sneakers! I have definitely sat for a late dinner and then sat around to talk while they cleared out the tables to start off the night. I got tired of having to dress up for disappointing Boston nightclubs but this is just a comfortable outing.They always have $5 mystery drinks that are my go-to!> I came here for a Trivia Factory night and ordered a dinnet special: ribeye with roasted brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The food was cooked well but none of it had flavor, almost like water. There was little to no seasoning. My friend who was with me also had the same thing with his dish as well.","4, 3, 4, 4, 2"

Wasn't crazy packed but the space is big.I had buffalo wings and my friend had the Chicken BLT with fries. My wings were great. My friend said his sandwich was alright.

I'd definitely go back. I was expecting the dishes to be more spicy than oily though. Otherwise, such a great place to get some good food. Don't pass on the corn. Such a great dish, would eat this every day.> This place is solid.Easy to get to as it's just outside the Central Square Red line T stop on Mass Ave.It gets pretty busy on weekends so plan accordingly.Menu is pretty robust with all the usual Chinese/Szechuan options. I went with the Fried Beef with Chili Rice and my friend went with the Szechuan Spicy Tofu. Both were very good. I would say it's some of the better Chinese food I've had in Cambridge.Wait staff is very busy but amenable. They get you the food pretty fast.Overall I recommend this place. It'd be better to go with more people so you can share many dishes, etc.> I came here around 1pm on a Saturday for lunch with a woman who not only frequented the restaurant, but also is Chinese and fluent in the language. For those reasons, I think I had an ""insider"" experience which panned out to be better than most. My companion ordered from the buffet looking area where you choose ingredients and have them cooked on the spot - a very wonderful option if I do say so. She went the spicy route and the dish included beef, shrimp, cilantro, a black ear looking mushroom, lotus root, squid, and I believe another vegetable. It was absolutely divine. From the menu we also ordered green beans and bamboo tips and each had a side of rice. The food was delectable and came out extremely fast. They aren't messing around. It's a small restaurant and quite popular so be prepared to sit at a table with other folks if there are no available booths. There is also definitely an advantage to knowing Mandarin, but I mean... You are in China Town. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would most definitely come again. Such good food, and not outreagously expensive for the area.> So many choices of restaurants in China Town. We randomly picked Five Spice House for lunch. A small dining room that filled before we finished. But then I noticed they have an upstairs. A very yummy meal. Prompt, friendly service.> I came with a group of friends who weren't that into family style so it's tough for me to gauge the full spectrum of what Five Spices House has to offer. That being said from what I did have, I am not rushing back to give it another go when there are so many other places around Chinatown that deserve a shot.The main reason for this is because I got the Beef Noodle Soup - a classic Chinese dish that can tell eons about a restaurant. Their bowl was filled to the brim and not skimping on the beef bits and veggies but the noodles were terribly overcooked and the broth was incredibly greasy - literally all oil on the top - and not that flavorful. Very disappointing. Also not spicy.The spiced duck tongue were pretty good although severely lacking in spice despite how many chilies are given to you (seriously where is the spice people, not even any 'ma'/numbing feels) ... I ate the chilies straight and was unfazed which should not have been the case. The duck tongues were plentiful though.","4, 4, 4, 4, 2"

The portions are huuuuge, definitely enough to share or save as a second meal.> Update.    I am baffled by this place.  Came in at 2:30pm.  I am the only one here.  4 people working here.  Ordered a Pho and it took 15 minutes?!  This takes about 3 minutes in the food truck with 1 or 2 workers.  I am not willing to come back for an actual lunch hour even though I like the food.Like their food a lot, but disappointing at times.  Today I was in a rush. Ordered online and came 15 minutes later.  There was nobody in the store and worker was just hanging out.  I asked for my online order and then he Started making it... defeats the point of pre-ordering..> + Ali's Pho - Chicken pho with noodles, chinese salt and pepper, cabbage, bean sprouts, red onion, cilantro, scallions, crispy shallots, and a slice of lime. Tasty and decent portions.+ Quick service.+ Self order on a tablet option.- Lukewarm broth.- No tray provided when order served.- Limited dine-in seats.> They just ALWAYS get my order wrong. (I only go here when I pick up food from Viga) I have really given them multiple chances at this point. The people are nice but they definitely don't have enough staff for busy lunches. I get the food truck fav with deviled tea eggs. Half the ingredients were missing from the bowl (no shallots, scallions, or vinaigrette) and so was the tea eggs I ordered. I'll just go to the little cart in Copley. Rule of thumb here: ALWAYS double check your order.> Bon Me is a great lunch spot in the Back Bay. I like to keep it local and we were very excited when they brought their food truck fare to the brick and mortar location. Some of the ingredients change up a bit over time, but there are always items of a similar theme (always some type of chicken on the menu for example).  I love the noodle salad and get it every time. I like the various spicy options that are available. The restaurant is on the Ritual app so you can order ahead to try to avoid the lines. The app also lets you add comments so you can customize things a bit. When in the city for work, I hit Bon Me roughly once a week and never tire of the choice. The couple of things that hold me back from a five star rating are occasional order accuracy issues and their limited drink options.","4, 2, 3, 4, 2"

I enjoy Bon Me in general however this specific time I went to try the ramen, As far as ramen goes there are a ton of places that do it better. While the portion size is big, the broth flavor is a little to tangy for me. The eggs are just boiled and are not the traditional tea egg. The noodles are average at best. I would not go here for ramen again. The rice and noodle bowls that I have had previously are really good though and this is something I would come back for. When visiting this specific location it seems very spacious and clean. It was empty when we went but I am sure it gets busy during the week around lunch time,> pretty good fusion asian food. Simple ingredients but tasty combo. Each with traditional tastes but in interesting combinations of ingredients in each concoction. Had kimchee pork ramen and Bon Me. Recommended for a fast food or light lunch.> I was a huge fan of the food truck when they first started out. Fresh ingredients and veggie options, what's not to love? I didnt really like the menu changes, but that's ok, I just didnt order them! I work near this location and had a craving for their Thai Basil lemonade so I braved the lunch rush. I went up to the counter and quickly made my order. The guy pours my drink and...tells me to wait in line with everyone waiting for lunch. I wait for 5 minutes before I cant stomach it and ask the guy at the end for my drink.Still the fastest food truck, but the storefront processes could use work.> Bon Me is a great place to go for a quick bite that is healthy and uses whole ingredients. I don't love how they use cilantro like lettuce, but I break off the amount I want before eating, or you could order without it. The menu is simple, get the sandwich thing, the rice thing or the salad thing...pick a protein...pick a spice...wait five minutes and you're good to go! The price is about average for takeout lunch in the area and they do a quick turnaround so they typically have a line, but don't get discouraged.","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

I'm here at least once a week because of the freshness of their ingredients and how tasty the different dressings are. They have several signature bowl options, as well as the option to build your own. I find myself craving the Miso and Cassie bowls over greens most of the time - definitely add the miso bbq tofu to anything you get (it's worth it!)> This place is the best. I think it's ridiculous that Efraim S. limited his review to 4 starts. I've eaten with him here and he always raves about it. He is scared about looking desperate on Yelp but he's a coward. If the felafel dog is truly the best, then why not give it five stars? Is there some superior felafel dog out there? No.Also, he has shit grammar and it's impossible to decipher what he is writing. His review is beyond comprehension. This is all from a Harvard Business a School student. The dude needs to get his shit together. This place is healthy and fantastic.> My advice to Whole Heart: don't advertise something if it's never available. The last 4 times I've gone to Whole Heart the artichoke toast is not available. This review went from two stars to four stars though because, although my avocado toast took way longer to prepare than you it should have (20+ min) - even people after me were being served first - one of the staff gave me a coupon and admitted that it took way too long, which is great-- admitting fault is a great way to keep customers.> If you're considering stopping by Whole Heart Provisions, just do it. And when you go, order the Cassie Bowl (8.85) with miso bbq tofu (+2) because it's the best and none of the other ones (while still good) have compared. The Cassie Bowl comes with japanese eggplant (so freaking tasty, and this is coming from a once eggplant hater), chickpeas, pickled cauliflower (the perfect crunch and sour contrast), savory green beans, basil (yes yes yes), currants (I'm all about the hint of sweetness), crispy chickpeas, and creamy harissa sauce. The warm bbq tofu adds protein and extra sauciness to the already delicious bowl. I've had this combination at least 10 times since January, and I'm still constantly craving it. Do yourself a favor and check out Whole Heart Provisions.On a side note, I've tried several other bowls including the Mission, the Viet, and Miso, the Levant, and the Kaya (okay, so almost every other option), and none were quite as delicious as the cassie. That said, the falafel is really good, and sometimes if I'm feeling wild I'll get The Cassie with falafel instead of bbq miso tofu.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Amazing amazing amazing Brazilian food (although I admit to being no expert) with knock-your-socks-off flavors and great, fresh seafood. I highly recommend the fish and shrimp muqueca (signature dish, seafood stew served in a clay pot) as well as the mariscada (similar idea with squid and mussels and crabmeat, but cooked in coconut milk). Portions are generous and even the rice is soft and fluffy and delicious. I think most of their dishes are served with a side of fish gravy, which is so delicious I always want to lick the bowl it comes in. They also offer an excellent, super spicy hot sauce if you ask, and we got a small side of plantains as well as yucca flour to top our dishes with. Entrees will run $20-25 each.Service is friendly and fast, the decor is fine -- comforting but not high-end or anything. Bathroom was clean. And small protip -- if you come for brunch / during lunchtime, they do have coffee for $2, even if it's not on the menu.> We had much higher expectations than our experience turned out to be.Walked in on Tuesday night around 7pm, with 2-3 tables taken. The interior looked nice. Our server was Linda - not the most welcoming person, very presumptuous and conceited. She seemed to already have a plan for what we needed to get. Linda didn't even listen to the end of our order. I was almost afraid to give her an order, leaving alone asking for recommendations. Linda tried to upsell couple of dishes as well, which I would consider under regular circumstances, but not there. I did though get a fish and shrimp moqueca, instead of just fish which I ordered and everyone at our table heard that. Mind you, it's $4 more than a fish one. And I would have never ordered shrimp, as we have a severe shrimp allergy in our party. Obviously, I would have indicated we can't have shrimp, had anybody inquired about it. Nope, didn't happen. I'm glad nobody suffocated in that restaurant to date and they didn't have any law suits for trying to kill people by putting in their food severe allergens in order to gain extra $4.When I got my dish and saw shrimp, I was just so disappointed,  as that dish took a long  time to be prepared. Nobody came to check whether our food was ok. By that time, there were only 2 tables left in the restaurant. We also never got hot sauce although we asked for it repeatedly.Fried yucca and house salad were both good. You can't go wrong with fried yucca anywhere. Fish and chips were soft and soggy, bland. Fish was a real fish to their complement, I think haddock. Not some type of fish meal with almost no fish. In addition, their fish sauce served with moqueca is truly appalling. Never coming back. Avoid.> I had high expectations of this place and it left me disappointed. The caipirinhas were a bit on the sweet side, but still delicious nonetheless. The food was honestly a bit lackluster - it wasn't particularly memorable. Salt was needed in multiple parts on my dish, from the fried fish to the potatoes. My friends had similar comments for their dishes. Service was pretty good overall though - our waitress was very warm and welcoming. Just wish the food was as well!> Everything from the caipirinha (similar to a mojito But sweeter) to the fried shrimp and fish appetizers ,to the fish and shrimp muqueca was absolutely delicious. The Muqueca was beautifully served in a clay pot.  The flavors from this regional dish are rich and unlike anything found at other area Brazilian restaurants. The service was attentive and friendly. They patiently answered all our questions and made recommendations that were spot on. I finished with the passion fruit custard, easily the most exquisite custard I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try their other dishes.","5, 5, 2, 3, 4"

A total recommended!!> The food is great if you can even get it, I placed an order through door dash and when the guy arrived to pick up the food the place was closed. Then of course the restaurant had no one answering phones (probably due to being closed while taking my money for orders). Door Dash has not refunded me the $60 plus dollars for this order.> Food is good, but customer service is ATROCIOUS. I ordered from Postmates 2  bowls (one shrimp and one fish), and what arrived was one burrito. The sticker on the bag had my order correct, but the food was not. My angel of a Postmates driver said, not to worry, she would grab the right order, and asked if I could just call in advance. Ohhhh lordy. I called and was first told that my Postmates order didn't exist, even though i had just received a Postmates order (albeit wrong). Then I was told very rudely that I didn't order properly, that I didn't say if it was a bowl or a burrito, or tacos, or enchiladas, etc.. I explained that I didn't WRITE the order I clicked a button from THEIR menu. She yelled at me for a bit about that.  She then yelled that I needed to bring back the burrito...no problem lady, my Postmates girl is on it. She then hung up on me. 5 minutes later I got a call from the angel Postmates driver saying that the restaurant has agreed to make 1 bowl, but is refusing to make my other bowl....so i text her my receipt which clearly indicates that I've paid for two bowls... doesn't matter. Postmates Corporate gets involved and speaks to the owner of Achillitos and he is now getting yelled at, and they STILL won't make my bowl. My poor Postmates driver had to leave because they were yelling at her in the store and she was afraid she was going to get out. Me, my Postmates driver, and the man from Postmates Corporate are all totally baffled as to what happened, and why, but take my advice, NEVER order out from Achilitos!> I've been dying for good pupusas to make they're way to Roslindale / JP area , so I was excited when I saw a nice big sign outside this place. I'm vegetarian and was delighted to see the many options they had, when I went to order they literally had only one type of pupusa (chicharrón) just my luck! My boyfriend got two with the Cole slaw and sauce and he was not a fan. The pupusa was extremely greasy and curtido and sauce it comes with was so small.  The place overall was very nice and looked clean  but the staff needs better management & better costumer service.> Carnitas burrito was absolutely delicious.Pork was cooked and seasoned perfectly as was the rice and beans","4, 1, 1, 2, 5"

The majority of our group wanted linguine Vongole, so we really just wanted a place that had it on the menu. The atmosphere was reminiscent of an Italian restaurant somewhere, not quite the typical small north end restaurant.We started with Caesar salad and fried mozzarella, both of which were great - classic, but done well. We also all picked at the bread, which we really enjoyed was focaccia slices in the basket. For our lunch, we ordered two linguine Vongole dishes, which we asked to be split (4 plates) in the kitchen. The half serving of Vongole was perfect and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, which was great. The ravioli was served in a cream sauce with pieces of lobster in the center of the plate. We did not have dessert, as we all wanted a cannoli from a certain bakery, but everything we ordered was delicious.> We drove up from NY so could not make a reservation as we did not know what time we would arrive.  It was around 9 pm on Friday night so we walked until we found a place with seating.... Florentine was that place The tables are super tiny with very large bases so zero room for your feet.... and I'm 5'2""!   It was pretty crowded and the staff and guests bump into your chairs constantly.  I can live with that. We ordered the antipasto plate to start.   It looked great except for the mound of tuna fish. I don't eat canned tuna and don't like the smell.... I've never seen canned tuna on an antipasto plate!  I am gluten free for medical reasons but was planning to throw my health to the wind for this one night... I wanted pasta!  I also can't eat nightshades so no tomatoes, so I ordered ziti with chicken and broccoli in a white wine garlic sauce. The plate came out with a mountain of Parmesan cheese all over it.  I do not like Parmesan... it smells like feet to me...   When I asked the waitress she told me she put the cheese on... and added extra!  ( she was very proud of that point!). I said I don't like Parmesan... she said everyone that comes in there loves lots of cheese which is why she dressed my plate for me.  And walked away. I tried to scrape it off. Then I tried to mix it in.  It was just overwhelming. I don't like Parmesan cheese.  When the waitress came back later she asked how the meal was and I said I don't like Parmesan cheese... so she offered me a dessert. I said that I wanted my dinner.  She offered to bring me a new entree but at that point it was 20 minutes later and I wasn't about to wait and eat by myself after my boyfriend was done with his meal. She did take my entree off the bill.  Overall this place is just weird.  The tuna fish... the staff seasoning your food....    With the other options in the neighborhood I would suggest to going elsewhere.> My husband and I stopped in for drink and I must say it was quite the experience.As soon as we sat down the bartender named manny made sure we felt welcomed. My husband ordered a negroni and loved it, I didn't know what to order manny recommended a drink called 333 and it was amazing. We stayed for second round   And ordered some apps the food was Great place overall Fantastic service> Cozy and quaint yet bustling atmosphere. Great location right on Hanover street. Tables were small and squished close together. Lots of people and crowded at the bar. Mixed ages (mainly mid 20s at the bar, which is my age). Food was good but nothing to write home about. Cocktails were good and strong. Wine list was a little lacking, as many of the bottles were ones you would find at the store like Josh and cupcake. Everything was pretty reasonably priced. Would be likely to come back for a casual cocktail, but more likely to try a new dinner spot than return here to eat.> Florentine Cafe has that extra, something- something. Every time my sister and I go here we end up having the best time. The environment is dark and moody, the drinks are outstanding, the environment is fun and lively, and the location is in the middle of the North End/Little Italy=prime real estate. Every time my sister and I are dining in the area, we grab a drink at Florentine. Last time I was there they had pineapple infused vodka that they served in a martini glass. To my dismay, they didn't have that this time around but they did redo their cocktail menu and they offered great Aperol and Campari spritzes. As I prefer bitter/tart over sweet, I ordered a Campari spritz and my sister ordered a glass of Rosè. We were fortunate enough to find two seats at the bar, before the place really started packing in. I remember the last time we were there, the music was a little bit more lively and louder, this was a little bit more subdued but still a fun environment. I've never tried food here but I do believe they have a solid menu. I'll save that for my next visit. For whatever reason, this has become a staple in our North End routine, I definitely recommend enjoying a drink here along the way as there is so much to do in the area. I recommend using a rideshare service because parking is difficult in this area. Enjoy!","4, 2, 4, 3, 4"

I was not expecting to really have a great experience here but I have zero complaints. Decent price too for Boston.

It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't the most amazing breakfast food I've had. The eggs needed more seasoning. The sausage and potatoes were delicious, though.The ambiance is obviously really nice - I went with 3 other moms and we all wanted a kid-free environment. This delivered. It was so nice to have a quiet, calm conversation!Our server was very nice and service was quick. We finished with plenty of time to get to our show. So if you're looking for a place to eat before seeing a play, I'd recommend it.And the bowl of Lindt chocolates on the way out was a special treat. :)> So I'll be honest--we came from the Public Garden Park and really had to pee. Starbucks was packed so we stumbled upon this joint. Lucky find!We weren't SUPER hungry so we had gotten starters, but we were happy with our find!This Beacon Hill spot leads to a very quaint part of the neighborhood near the famed ""Acorn Street"".Today is Labor Day so business was not as usual and they had such a busy weekend they were missing menu items. Nonetheless, food was pretty good! I highly recommend the Grilled Flatbread. Between the mozzarella, marinara, and basil, I was in heaven Also, the bathrooms are clean and are downstairs, in case you were wondering!> I'm incredibly hesitant to write this review and expose this spot for fear that it'll, too, become teeming with people on the weekends. This place gets 5 stars for its lovely brunch service because they have consistently well-executed food, consistent service, and you. can. always. get. a. table. Some may think this is a bad thing, but truly, it's only bad if the food isn't fresh or service isn't good, or some other terminal flaw. It's really just a hidden gem, tucked away in plain sight on Charles. I love trying out new hot spots but sometimes you wake up on a weekend morning and just don't feel like waiting in line to get a table. You want your food, and you want it now! If that's the case, come to BHB. TL;DR: You're not going to find fruity pebbles crusted french toast stuffed with nutella here, but you can get a damn good benny and you can get it without waiting.> I walked by this place so many times and didn't know it existed. I randomly found it one day on Yelp and decided to come for brunch. It's a typical hotel restaurant and the interior is very classy. Lots of natural light streaming in from outside and it gives the inside a very clean, refreshing look.I ordered the French toast and a side of beef hash. Boyfriend ordered the vanilla pancakes and the same side. My French toast was delicious. Every bite had something else in it besides just the toast. The beef hash was amazing. I took a bite of the hash after a bite of the toast and almost wanted to stop eating the toast so I could just keep eating the hash. Very flavorful and the brussel sprouts were cooked pretty well. I got OJ and it was freshly squeezed. Although at $4 for a not-so-large cup of it, I'd probably skip next time. Boyfriend liked both his dishes as well.Staff was fast and attentive. Until at the end when our check came out. There was a mistake and we were charged the wrong price for an item but it was quickly fixed. Would definitely come back again for the food.","5, 3, 4, 5, 4"

Can get a little messy but they have bathrooms. The menu was kind of restricting because I always end up getting the beast but makes it easier to choose. The frappes are huge but wish they had whipped cream. They usually give you the mixing cup and another cup for the shake. Staff are friendly and the music is like stuff you would hear at Johnny Rockets. The seats remind me of five guys. They have cups for water and you can just go up to refill. It's pretty empty when I go there too.I feel like the music changed a little and the fries are thicker. Still no whipped cream. And they switched to a smaller plastic cup.> I remember seeing the food truck up in Portland but didnt have time to give it a try. Now I can sit and enjoy their food, which I much prefer. Service, food, and atmosphere are very good. They use high quality ingredients so the prices reflect that. Keep in mind that the burgers can get a bit soggy and messy near the last few bites so have those napkins ready.> TL;DR High quality burgers but too pricey for what you get. I ordered Mainely Burgers on Grubhub because they had an offer of 35% off your order. We were going to eat locally, but I thought this made it a decent deal. I ordered the Mainah while my boyfriend got the Coop. We also split an order of truffle fries. I believe this originally would have been $25. The Mainah was really good. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The toppings were good but relatively tasteless. I got this to go, and when I ate it about 15 minutes later everything was soggy. The bun was falling apart and the apples lost their crunch. I tried my boyfriends burger and it was much better with the fried egg and again cooked perfectly. The truffle fries ($4.25) were good but soggy. They don't have size options. I also thought based on photos they would come with cheese but they only come with truffle oil. Their condiments also cost extra so I had to use the extra mayo from my burger. We demolished our burgers so they were definitely good, but definitely not worth the $9.25+tax. If you do come here make sure to eat in, because everything would have been better fresh. I will also say based on ordering online it appears that they take allergies seriously which is great!> I'm not a big fan of burgers, but decided to check out this place. It's a new location and in a neighborhood where parking is much easier than driving into Boston, phew.We ordered the Shroom' & Swiss burger with a double veggie patty. It came, as the name suggests, with sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese, along with lettuce, tomato, and house sauce. The veggie patty was unlike any I've tried in the U.S. It's a green patty (usually it's always black bean or at the most sweet potato), so it felt great to try something different. While it was tasty, I feel it lacked salt. However, you can make up for it with the various sauces. So I didn't mind! This way, it is more accessible to those who prefer a low salt intake. We ordered the parmesan fries as a side. The fries were crispy but I could have done with a lot more parmesan, haha.The ambiance is pretty sunny and open. Quite a lot of seats and no wait time. You order at the counter and the food is ready in minutes.Pro tips -1: Free parking on the street.2: Check out the Boston mural on their wall.3. So many burger options, they also have temporary specials - check out the far right menu board.4: If you get their veggie patty, ask them to top it with some Sriracha!> On par with Wahlburgers. Mediocre and expensive. Fast casual burger joint hailing from Maine trying to break into the burger industry against the likes of Five Guys, Burger Fi, Shake Shack etc who do it better.$16.25 for a Mainah burger (apple slices, bacon, cheese, sauteed onions, maple mayo), brussel sprouts, and soda. I also got lettuce, onion, tomato on my burger and a side of spicy Thai mayo. I ordered my burger medium rare and got it well done unfortunately. The brussel sprouts we're crispy but oh so greasy. Each bite was a burst of grease in my mouth. My fellow diners ordered the beast beef burger with an egg and it was a hard Sunny side up sadly. The veggie burger was a green patty of mush, flavorful by itself but tasteless mess in the coop (pickled onions, spicy mayo, egg). The chicken burger was small but the chicken breast was still moist. Their fries are interesting. They're crispy and kinda hollow. The truffle version they toss the fries in light truffle oil and they come very shiny. An expensive mediocre burger with mediocre sides. They don't have the rhubarb drink here like they do at the Central location.","4, 4, 3, 4, 3"
Café Luna,Cambridge,4.0,2,Yes,Yes,Yes,cafeluna-centralsq.com,"Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",7:00 am - 5:00 pm,7:00 am - 6:00 pm,7:00 am - 6:00 pm,7:00 am - 6:00 pm,7:00 am - 6:00 pm,9:00 am - 5:00 pm,9:00 am - 5:00 pm,Null,Null,"I've been to Cafe Luna a handful of times over the years I've lived here, and have always had a generally positive experience. In the middle of the Covid era, though, I thought it was time to leave a review, since I was blown away by the quality and service of their takeout brunch. To expedite everything, they only take online orders (though someone was available over the phone if you had questions), and the platform is easy to use and SUPER customizable (every side option/addition is available and it's easy to specify what you want). We selected a time for pickup and had to wait just a few minutes past that time.We drove home smelling deliciousness and when unpacked our bag, everything was well packaged and condiments (ketchup, butter, syrup) were separated from the dishes so nothing ran together or got soggy. The food was still top notch - the roasted vegetable omelette was a great size, the vegetables were all cooked really well and incorporated into the omelette, and the homefries were well seasoned. The blueberry lemon french toast was truly melt in your mouth and had definitely held up through travel. We didn't need the syrup on top. The prices are still Cafe Luna prices, but I think feels cheaper when you're not in store ordering a drink/coffee. I'm really impressed at their service and quality even in this challenging time and we're hoping we can keep supporting them!> Excellent brunch. I highly recommend to go in a group and share plates. We ordered:- Lemon ricotta pancakes (our fav. The pancakes melt in your mouth)- Chocolate raspberry French toast (all of their French toast is made with cinnamon swirl bread! Incredible flavors. This was another fav but is pretty heavy so be prepared)- Corned beef hash omelet with fruit on the side (great, but not as good as the other dishes)- Surf n' turf eggs Benedict (one with lobster the  other with sirloin) with home fries on the side - super yummy!- grilled biscuit with honey butter (SO GOOD but not pictured!)- matcha latte - vanilla latte- orange juiceThe drinks were over priced in our opinion ($4-5 each) for their quality, but the dishes were definitely worth their prices.None of the above dishes had nuts in them!> Amazing food with great service, every time I  went there was super happy with service and can't stop talking about how great and memorable they make each visit. Even though there is a wait on the weekends it's totally worth it!!! :)Fantastic!!!> As a huge brunch fan who lives nearby, I've been to Cafe Luna several times now. On each occasion, I've made it a point to arrange a reservation beforehand. The wait can last over an hour, especially on the weekends. If you're thinking about booking, you can do so here: resy.com/cities/bos/cafe…Their extensive brunch menu has something for everyone -- a mix of both healthy and indulgent dishes. Looking back, I haven't had a meal here that I disliked! My personal favorites include:// fig, prosciutto & goat cheese omelet - $15balsamic marinated figs, goat cheese, leeks and prosciutto// house specialty lemon ricotta pancakes - $16topped with fresh berries and lemon curd// roasted vegetable breakfast bowl - $15quinoa with roasted vegetables, caramelized onion, sunflower seeds, avocado, and two eggs// house made corned beef hash plate - $16with two poached eggs and toast or home friesProTip: Unlimited coffee refills!!> Definitely get a reservation ahead of time! If you don't, you're likely looking at a long wait.  The seating includes shared tables, particularly for smaller groups. The food at Café Luna is definitely indulgent! If you wish you were eating dessert instead of breakfast, try any of their sweet options. Otherwise they have tons of Benedicts, omelets, and a excellent looking Mac and cheese. We split the chocolate raspberry churro french toast and it was still too much for either of us to finish. It was fried cinnamon sugar french toast smothered in chocolate, some form of ricotta, and TONs of raspberries.We also split the biscuits. They have one meat option for each biscuit, with an egg and a fig jam. We got one spicy chicken and one hash. The spicy chicken was amazing! The meat in the hash was a too stringy and the flavor was lost in the mashed up potato. The jam was a somewhat confusing addition. Overall, I'd recommend getting spicy chicken and dropping the jam if you get the biscuits. The prices are high, even for Cambridge. They clearly use fresh, high quality ingredients. However, you're looking at $20-30 for an eggs Benedict or $15-20 for pancakes/french toast.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

We got seated and our server took the order quick, but both drinks and food took a long while to come out.The place itself is beautiful! The decor is so rich and fun, and it seems authentic. Drinks were good--my Moroccan Mojito was delicious but tasted more like juice than alcohol. The server kindly added a shot for me . For whiskey drinkers--Old Fashioned was pretty good!Food was alright, but didn't blow me away. The calamari ras hanout sounded amazing but wasnt crispy like I like my fried calamari, it had a soggy texture. The harissa aioli was really yum though.The kebab pasta was good! The chicken was very flavorful, and the pasta had vodka sauce on it. I was expecting moroccan flavor in the pasta, but it was just regular vodka sauce. Not bad but not what you would expect here.The grilled mixed kebab was very good too! Got chicken and lamb and they were both tasty. It came with veggies, salad, rice and 2 dips. We got tzatziki  and spicy feta.Overall would come back for the atmosphere, but not dying to have the food again.> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. They took my reservation over the phone than told me when I got there that they don't accept reservations and turned my party of 12 away. They also recently implemented a dress code but did not tell me over the phone or post it on the website -- again turning my party of 12 away. Horrible management, horrible customer service. I will never attempt to go here ever again. The response I got when I asked for an exception- ""you can write an email to the owner tomorrow""> My friend & I decided to checkout the hookah at Tangierino on a Saturday night and we doing out their hookah lounge is called Koullshi. So we decided to head there. The bouncer at Koullshi, I think his name is Yassir looked at my ID but was an absolute prick to my friend. The bouncer denied us entry without even looking at my friends ID and she had multiple forms of ID. We went back to the restaraunt to speak to the manager so the manager of the restaurant called Tauheef the manager of Koullshi and got us entry. We went back to the hookah joint and the bouncer dead ass said he was not going to let my friend enter and went down to speak to Tauheef cane up back up and said he was not going to let us in. So we asked him to let us speak to the manager Tauheef but HE STOOD THERE DID NOT MOVE & TOLD US HE HAD CALLED THE MANAGER & THAT WE HAD TO WAIT. Like wth kind of service and attitude is this. Mind you my friend had been in before so this was an absurd situation. At this fine my friend was done she didn't even care but I wanted to speak to the owner of the place or the manager! So I go in to speak to the manager or the Owner Samad and the manager asks me to wait outside. He comes back up and we have a convo he says he'll deal with the bouncer but does not let me speak to the owner. The bouncer was an absolute prick and I might go back to try this place but this will always be the first experience I tell people about of this place.> Dont believe what you hear on the phone when your told 25 min before arrival that there's 10-15 min wait. Came all the way from San Diego, UBERED down just to show up n be told they were at full capacity. We were then redirected to the bar just to be told at the bar that they were closed ( so unorganized ) we then sat in an area towards the back and were told "" I just wanna let you know that it's at least a 30 min wait but there's no promises"" ya ALLAH. Sorry Mohammed, I don't know if you runnin the joint for your babba habibi but you suck.> Came here with a Moroccan friend for his birthday dinner and while I liked it, he said it wasn't very authentic as it was focused on meats and what he likes most is the variety of vegetables that are usually offered. My fist time eating out of a tajine, which was still cool. The sprits list is huge, so come with a friend who knows what they're talking about (cough me cough) or don't be afraid to ask!","4, 1, 1, 1, 3"

I stopped by after the Godzilla ride.Our service was a little sub par but hard not have a great time with the beautiful weather. We had a delicious mushroom pizza which is great to share between 2, the angry orchard cider and Jack's Abby. I would definitely recommend this on a nice day.> My husband and I were famished after our morning travels by car, bus, airplane, bus and water taxi. We anted a simple Boston nite to eat. We saw the reef on our way to checking into the Marriott on the reef. The hostess was sweet and efficient. Although it was a sunny Sunday afternoon the restaurant was not over busy and there was plenty of staff to search the clients efficiently. Our waiter, Danny (I think) was way under par in all respects.  He ran to and fro, he was slow and did not take care of us in an acceptable manner.  He took our order and our wait was excessive for a sandwich and soup.  My soup came with chip. 3 of them. The soup was delicious!  And two were mostly holes as they were very thin. We never got water refills nor did he check on us.  I watched him to get his attention and saw that his spermatic activities were not advantageous to proper care of his customers.  Usually a training problem.  I went to him, requested the check and sat down. He brought the check, then we waited another 15 minutes before I went to get him again.  I talked to a manager. She apologized and said she would ""take care of me"" NEXT Time!  I think that THIS TIME would have been a better idea.  We were tired and wanted to get to our hotel.  End of story.> Be aware...EXTREMELY slow service!  Foods good but if you have no plans and not on any schedule or very hungry, then you will have no issues. Our family loved the location and overall vibe but the service was so so slow....it lowered our initial enthusiasm.  For example, two orders of New England Clam chowder and two glasses of Pinot  took 20 minutes and they weren't that busy.> Great little spot The manager Debra  is wonderful, very sweet and attentive.  Our drinks were cold and delicious. Did not try the food but they have a nice selection of food.> This place is the best! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 3 years, it's very special to us. It's the first place that he told me he loved me, that was 3 years ago. Fast forward 3 years, this is where he proposed to me:)I recommend Reef Bar for anyone looking for an quality cocktail, friendly service, and good vibes!","4, 1, 2, 2, 5"

Just call it in ahead of time.> I've been here a couple of times and both times I've enjoyed my meals.  It's a simple low-key neighborhood type of place.  But that really works to its advantage in my opinion.  Each time I visited there has been a relaxed, laid back, comfortable atmosphere that makes for a pleasant dining experience.  The wait staff is friendly, helpful and dutifully answered the few questions that I had.   The food is solid and the portions are very respectable for the price.  They have a few Greek beers to choose from as well as some other no so adventurous selections.  Each time I've ordered kebabs of some sort and been very satisfied.  I made sure to finish things off with a piece of baklava and it totally hit the spot.  This place doesn't disappoint and I'm sure I'll be back.> This is a solid Greek restaurant! I had a chicken gyro with fries and it was delicious. Even the pita itself was really good-- it was warm, thick and perhaps lightly fried. I loved the homemade fries and was really glad I opted for the combo!The restaurant is small and casual. The service was friendly. The drinks were reasonably priced and the house wine was decent. I don't have a lot to say except I would definitely go back!> Cozy and intimate place for dinner, with casual ambience and artsy environment. I like the warm and cozy feeling in this place, making me feel like being home. It's a little loud and crowded but very welcoming and hospitalizing. The kitchen ventilation is not very good so the whole dining hall is heated by the kitchen heat and a bit smell but I'm not complaining.The food is good. We had a lamb shank and a gyrio. The shank is cooked very well. The gyrio is not bad. Pretty healthful food and cooking style, I believe. It's a greek place, although I feel it's slightly leaving to middle eastern style. Anyways, delicious and nice for a casual dinner. Good price and serving size, too.> Came here for lunch. Nice spacious seating area. Service was friendly and quick. Order Greek salad with grilled chicken, spinach pie and sovoulniki plate. The salad was tasty and fresh. Spinach pie was fairly big portion and was ok. Came with some cold pita :( the plate came with two stick of meat, some salad and fries (which were a bit soggy). Overall food had good portion and was tasty although not best Greek food I had.

This is the first FAST (Food Ambience Service Trendsetter) review coming your way!Food: 5 I'm a sucker for arepas. We ordered the prenil arepa to start. The pork was so flavorful and tender, every bite was perfect with a great combination of pork and cheese. It's different from the street style arepa, the cheese wasn't melted and the breading on the outside is open. For our main entrees Asado Negro and Pabellon criollo. Both entrees were super good. The asado negro beef with au jus mixed perfectly with the white rice. Loved every bite!Ambience: 4 Great atmosphere, not too small but we sat in a cozy corner. The lighting is dim to set the mood! Service: 5I wish I could give the service more than 5 stars.. I was so shocked by how fast the food came and the waiter was very attentive even though he had a lot of tables to look after. Trendsetter: 4Pretty unique considering there's not much Latin food in Boston/Cambridge. I hope this place is around to stay!Final FAST Score: 5Overall great restaurant and highly recommend! Would definitely come back again> Since I moved to the United States I had a horrible experience trying to find the flavors of my beloved Venezuela. I tried a couple of restaurants in the West coast and I found disappoinment every single time. These restaurants would claim to be Venezuelan but their chef were not Venezuelans and the dishes didn't taste like our homemade food. However, yesterday I took my mother in law and my boyfriend (Americans) to enjoy the food of my country since we were walking around Harvard. I was worried at first but I am happy that I gave it a try! We ordered Tequeños, empanadas to start and then Asado negro, pabellón criollo and pollo adobo with tajadas. I also had a delicious agua de panela y limón that transported me for a second, to the Venezuela of my childhood, lost but not forgotten.> Orinoco is tucked away off of busy JFK street in Harvard Square. Its dining room has a warm, homey field to it, especially during the chilly Boston fall. We arrived just before 7 PM on a Friday and had to wait about 30 min to be seated. Once seated, the staff was friendly, and service was prompt. We started with a nice glass of Malbec and for my entree, I had the parilla caraquena (mixed grill). The mixed grill included a combination of Venezuelan chorizo, chicken, and steak served beside a heap of limey guacamole and a pile of yucca fries smothered in tangy Mojo. I've also had the beef empanadas from Orinoco, which were probably the best rendition I've had outside of Latin America. Compared to other spots in Harvard Square, I think Orinoco has a leg up for dinner in the $20 entree price range. Will return for another dinner or brunch!> I've been dying to try out this place since I first saw it in Brookling Village. I finally got to visit the Cambridge location instead and it was pretty awesome! I don't recall the actual menus (sorry!) but one of the two dishes we ordered was ""the most traditional Venezuelan"" entree and the other one was Pepito something. Both were very hearty, the waiter was super helpful, and the experience made me want to explore more Venezuelan cuisine. One thing I didn't love about the restaurant was that it was really cold (we were sitting near the kitchen and whenever the door opened, the wind seeped through). Overall, a very pleasant experience!> Delicious celebration of cheese and life! My colleague and I checked this place out and were not disappointed once. Have a whole meal of arepas, small plates, and empanadas! The mushroom flatbread is a meal in itself, but the arepas were stuffed with cheese ... and my god, I as 50 Cent once said, I loved them like a fat kid loves cake. I also asked for some hot sauce and a huge bottle was placed on the table. This stuff is no joke, and like Sex Panther in ""The Anchorman,"" ""smelled like pure gasoline."" But it was a delicious touch to everything.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Urged us to order our rolls right away because the sushi bar was wrapping up, but took a bit too long to ask our orders (time is of utmost importance). All in all, I love the decor in the restaurant and really appreciate them being patient with us as the last guests of the night. I definitely want to come again and eat at our leisure.> Not bad for the price.. My favorite is the tri color don which comes with rice and miso soup. The gyu don was okay - could use more flavor. However it comes with  miso soup, a maki roll and 4 pieces of nigiri making the entree very filling. Due to the limited sushi options in back bay, this is a good option for a no frills, quick sushi dinner or lunch. Chose this place because of the seated app!> For lunch, a Gyu-Don Lunch Bento to go.Beef with Onion, Served with chef's choice of maki and appetizers, rice, miso soup, and house salad.The salad and miso soup were fine.  The beef tasty, but thin cut and a bit tough.  The portion of the main dish was better than first impressions with the two appetizers having been tucked into the same compartment.  The dumpling was a bit soft though it tasted better than the one I had at Fuji's on my last visit.  I liked the crumb crusted vegetable patty more though.For another lunch, another Bento, this time the Pan Seared Salmon Steak Lunch Bento, Teriyaki flavored.I read in another review how the fish was raw in the center, so I asked for mine to be cooked through, medium well.The first round, the maki were some kind of raw fish (I'm not really a raw fish gal), maybe tuna?  This time they were more my cup of tea - California Rolls.  Though a bit loosely wrappedThe fish was cut into two pieces and not particularly strongly flavored, however, I later discovered that their little compartment in the bento had some sauce at the bottom.  Dredging the fish in that upped the experience quite a bit.  The first piece was cooked through as requested.  The second was shiny smooth pink in the center, medium perhaps?The apps were again found in the same compartment as the protein, and the dumpling was greatly enhanced by its dip in the sauce pool.Between the two bentos thus far - my vote goes to the beef.Their Tiramisu dessert is a dainty portion but light and tasty.They also offer a white grape aloe drink in a can.> The service could be better. The sushi  was alright, I've had better. They do have these cool seats next to the window and those are perfect for people watching. It's a small location and decent variety of sushi. They are right on Newbury St. but I will be trying out a different restaurant next time I go to newbury st. The UMAI sushi roll is $14 and it comes with 8-9 pieces. The sushi roll was good/alright.> This is my first Yelp review ever, so listen up. The service was horrendous, management nonexistent, and the food was the worst TROLL sushi ever. Let me get into it right now. My order was completely wrong, or the waitress was wrong, or the sushi chef was wrong, or just wrong wrong wrong. I ordered Tamago Sweet Egg Sushi. Is that hard to understand? It came out sashimi, then they had to correct my order. Now I won't describe how it came out. You will have to check out the picture yourself. Trust me, it will be the cutest Tamago sushi ever. I guess they coming up with a new hybrid fusion of sashimi/nigiri called stuck in between, or maybe they just ran out of RICE.The sweet potato tempura was not sweet as all. The batter was bad. Just bad. I only ate one piece and the server took it back. No return of a new sweet potato tempura nor was it taken off the bill. Wow. What service!Ordered Umai Roll, didn't come out. Thank God!And now the highlight of the night, the infamous ""Baked Alaska Roll"" which costs $16, so a Premium Roll right? Wrong! Check the picture below! I ordered it without cream cheese only, but look at it, missing so many more things on it. At least drip the spicy mayo on it Bro to make it look like the picture.Manager verbatim ""the maki doesn't come out like the picture."" Ummmm, many if not all people order food based on the DESCRIPTION and PICTURE that your menu states. WTF?!!! I can't believe she said every sushi chef makes it their own way, not admitting they made a mistake, no intent of correcting or changing it for me, but rather argue with your customer when clearly what I ordered is not what I got. Mindblown! If I can give this place 0 stars, I would be the first in line. My first Yelp Review happens to be a Negative one. I will no longer eat there and promote others to stay away and not get tricked with this foolery. Or in my case, some TROLLing Sushi.","4, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Bartender was not friendly to me however seemed very involved with coworkers and regulars, and in fact never took any of my orders but participated in this weird thing where the manager took my order and she silently filled it. No biggie really I like the quiet.Weird #2. One dollar upcharge for fries with burgers and sandwiches. Dude it's a dollar! Either bump your prices by a buck or charge a couple bucks extra. Just weird.Weird #3. Nothing on tv except MNF pregame at 7:30 pm. I am the only one at the bar besides a couple at the end. There are 9 TVs at said bar. But, some genius turns 7 of the screens to celtics pregame and 2 to some college game.Weird #4. Dooley's pub across the street was packed on a Monday, with not even one seat at the bar, but this place was pretty much vacant when I was there. Should have been my clue.The food: weak menu. A lot of chicken. No beef tips as I saw online. I wound up getting the Reuben, which was very good, but would have been excellent if more meat, or at least they spread it out to the edges of the bread. Sweet potato fries were hot and crispy. Attractive menu.The beer: decent selection but super pricey. I had 2 ipas one was 10 dollars one was 9. Too many other choices nearby. Not a horrible experience, just nothing special and $40 for beer and a sandwich. Super disappointed in this place because it COULD have been great!> A colleague and I decided to check out Battery Park after arriving in Boston for business on a Thursday night.  We were looking for an easy, nearby sports bar with good food and cold beer, and it hit the spot.  Similar to New York, the Financial District in Boston seemed to clear out as the evening went on, but this establishment had a decent crowd for a Thursday night.  We split the Fried Pickles appetizer, and for my entree I went with the Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls.  Both were tasty, although I took a particular liking to the Egg Rolls, which is a pub dish I tend to relish when done right.  They came with six pieces and were served with a southwest ranch sauce as well as a spicy ketchup - gotta love it when a place doesn't skimp on dipping sauces!  The restaurant also has a couple dozen different beers to choose from, ranging from some unique craft beers to $3 draft Natural Light.  Additionally, there are TVs everywhere to watch whatever game(s) may be on.Battery Park Bar & Patio satisfied exactly what we were looking for.  I would definitely recommend to someone staying in the area.> Stumbled upon this hidden gem on my lunch break today! The back patio reminds me of New York patios with the string lights, exposed brick, and city vibe. Our server was phenomenal and gave us great recommendations for lunch as it was our first time. It was refreshing to have a server who you could tell enjoys their job! I got the taco salad and my friend got the shrimp tacos (on the recommendation of the server). Both dishes were great! The manager even came over to our table mid meal to check on us. :-)If you can't make it here for lunch you have to at least come for a drink on the patio. Literally a hidden gem in the heart of Boston. I'll be back soon!> Cute bar food snack vibes. Quesadilla had barely any cheese, and the philly steak egg rolls looked better than it tasted. The buffalo chicken Rangoon's were actually the best thing I've had in forever. I would go back just for that. Also the nachos looked amazing.","4, 3, 3, 4, 3"
Ristorante Euno,Boston,4.0,3,Yes,Null,No,eunorestaurant.com,"Italian, Mediterranean, Pasta Shops",5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,Null,Null,"Was delighted to a four course meal in the downstairs wine cellar at Ristorante Euno! This is definitely the way to dine at another fantastic North End Italian restaurant. My friend reserved the cellar for her birthday party of about 20 people. The staff and owner were more than accommodating and happy to host our large group (even though we got a little loud after a few heavy pours of wine!) The cellar is a perfect spot for a dinner event.Now for the food...First course: Assorted AntipastiThe staff brought around multiple apps for the tables with plenty of food for everyone to try. We had the deliciously crispy calamari fritti, a cheese and charcuterie plate, and my favorite -- the meatballs! They melted in your mouth. Second course: Pasta! 2 dishes to tryOkay truly this was my favorite course of the night. I could have ate an entire pot of the Gnocchi con Funghi. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in the North End -- just imagine tasting gorganzola, mushrooms and truffle oil in a cream sauce with potato pillows... drooling again just thinking about it. We also got the Rigatoni Fatti in Casa which is roasted eggplant over thicker noodles in a red sauce. It was also very tasty, but my mind was already set on getting as much gnocchi as possible on my plate.Third course: EntreeWe had a choice of 4 options for an individual entree. The sirloin steak (Bistecca Euno) was a popular option, but the waiter gave a glowing recommendation of the daily peppercrusted tuna special so I had to go with that. He was not wrong, it stood alone as a knockout dish. Served with rice and green beans, it was a filling dish cooked perfectly.Fourth course: Obviously dessert! We had an assortment of treats come out for dessert. The creme brûlée... just amazing. The cannoli was also delicious. Oh and the flourless chocolate cake, yummm. On top of that, several of us finished with an espresso martini. Great way to end the night! Throughout the whole dinner we constantly had staff checking on us and refilling our glasses. Keeping this place in mind for when I host a birthday dinner.> Fantastic host and atmosphere! Our meals were great. Monkfish special along with fettuccine, scallops and lobster. The calamari was great as well.We got to try a sample of the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and mushrooms and the gnocchi were delicious.Make sure to make a reservation!> O M Ggo here. Skip the other spots and go here!!! We had a group of 20 people, they seated us in their lovely basement and we had not only excellent service but also amazing food!!We tried all the appetizers including the specials- honestly you cannot go wrong.I personally also got the truffle gnocchi- dear god if I didn't have a flight at 4am the next day I seriously would have eaten the leftovers for breakfast it was so good.> I was tempted into this restaurant because someone told my company that this was the best restaurant in the north end... I might have to disagree. The menu is very small, but the pasta was very good. The fish came with 5 potato wedges, so portions were skimpy for $30 (well seasoned potato though, so more potato would have been great). They are understaffed. Getting a refill of water took a long time and required waving hands in the air. Bathrooms were kind of dirty.> I have a love hate relationship with the North End, which mostly consists of me loving all of the small mom and shop restaurants with delicious Italian food, but hating the long waits and failed attempts to eat at said restaurants. Anyways, enter Ristorante Euno, a cute North End spot that that takes reservations. Decided to check it out with a couple friends a while back and had a great time!We started with the Caprese Homemade and Carciofo Euno. The Caprese was yummy, though it's pretty much good everywhere. The grilled artichoke was surprisingly delicious, especially with the generous amount of goat cheese! And I certainly can't complain about how large they were and how tasty well they went with the prosciutto. Yum!!! I then had the pasta special of the night, a Seafood Squid Ink Pasta. It was really good! Generous amounts of seafood and well-cooked pasta. My only complaint was that it was a tad oily, but that didn't stop me from gobbling it down for dinner, and for lunch the next day. Service was warm and friendly. There's a more romantic feel at Euno than at other North End places, probably a combination of the dim lighting, exposed brick, and lack of people shouting. Will definitely come back to Euno when I want a nicer meal in the North End, or when I want to avoid those long lines that make me so grumpy!","4, 5, 4, 5, 3"

Really good. Fun place, good energy, a bit pricey and worth it. Years ago, my friend and I would go there and when they served you your coffee, they gave you a dish with the sugar options and included some chocolate disks to make your hot coffee mocha. Was so good! Never found another restaurant do this. If you find one tell me!I've had business lunches, celebratory lunches and more. I like it.> tl; dr: anywhere else. OMG, ANYWHERE ELSEWhen you'd rather go anywhere else in Boston, that's a one-star. ANYWHERE else.First couple of visits, I was wooed. I thought Les Zyg was dependable. All you have to do is see my earlier reviews. And then a friend from Philly said,  ""I'm coming to Boston -- South Station -- let's meet,"" and I thought of Les Zyg. I mean, why not? They're old school, they have happy hour specials, they have music....Who wouldn't want a Manhattan and a few oysters?But we got there and it was an unmitigated disaster. We ordered drink and food from the happy hour menu, stuff that, while on sale, sill adds up to a pricey meal. But from start to ... well, we never got to the finish -- from the get-go, it was sad, slow, disheveled,disinterested service. Any negative modifier that you can think of, that was Les Zyg. If you doubt believe me, just try them. They'll be glacially slow, bad --We order $70 worth of food and drink. What we got was -- to put it politely --- shitty -- and what we didn't get, we'd waited a VERY LONG TIME before it never showed. And we're taking food and drink in the after-work hours. Drinks aren't reduced-prices. It was so bad -- the Philly friend with obligations elsewhere -- that we finally said something, such as, you know, we're running out of time. And the manager? Who knows who is in charge here. Whomever she was, by the time we said something, she was, like, GO. That's how bad it was. She was, like, go.....How often does management wave you off a $70 tab? It was very bad.It was so so very bad that the restaurant itself was all, like, get out of here. For us, it was a disaster. We left there hungry and thirsty and dragged a suitcase all the way to Quincy Market for a reasonable bite to eat. And I thought, OMG, here's this place that I gave a bunch of stars, a full throated endorsement. Maybe it was an aberration?But I couldn't bring myself to try it again. I couldn't even update my review. And I purposed to never return, And I didn't.And then a bestie said, We're meeting at that place....What place, I asked. (I thought it was Trouque on South.)  I was, like, sure. See you there. I love Matt's Sazerac. But when she said it was Les Zyg, I was aghast..... But I thought, okay, maybe it's just me. Maybe that last visit was a mistake, a bad night....SO I showed up. They had a table in the bar, two very attractive ladies drinking cosmos. I joined them. And I swear, my god, it was probably 30 minutes of chatter with NO server. NONE. I'm frickin parched. This is a smallish place at happy hour -- not even full -- and NO server shows up to say ""what'll it be?""So i finally get up to ask the bartender. At which point, a server shows up. Meanwhile, my friends say, server is absent, you'd better know EXACTLY what you want if anyone shows up table-side. And because I don't trust them, I order a beer on draft and the oyster special. That's it. The beer comes quickly, the cocktails not as, but the oysters? 45 minutes? FORTY-FIVE FRICKEN MINUTES. Are they knee-deep in the water dredging the creatures?(One could hope.)Am I in MCI Framingham? (What an ugly ugly scene.)At Les Zygomates, service is non-existent. Food is ordinary. But, prices are very high, consistent with every other place in Boston and the vicinity. OMG, I can't wait until someone who knows how to run service buys this place out. The only way I'd ever return is if they're burying by mother and the drinks are free and self-service. And free. Even then, I'd bring a flask.> Very elegant setting. There's a room with a man playing piano and on the other side is more casual music so you can really pick your mood. The prices were a bit high but the cocktails were amazing. Would definitely come here for a date night.> We had a reservation for 8:30 but still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. It was a Friday night, but they weren't ridiculously crowded and the service was a bit slower than I expected. However, the live music was really nice and the overall ambiance was great. I had the sangria and it was just ok, but we split a bottle of champagne that was wonderful. The bread and butter was amazing - I believe they put honey in the butter. We got some clams and oysters to start, as well as the yellowfin tuna which I would definitely recommend. I ordered the duck and it was absolutely perfect! I would come back and have that again. To finish it all, we had the raspberry and lemon sorbet. It was a great way to end the meal.This place is lovely and the live music/food quality makes it worth checking out for sure.> I have been here once and thought my experience was just okay. There was nothing exceptional about it, except maybe its live music performance.I had the magret duck breast ($36), and I finished everything on my plate, it was so good! But... it is not really French cuisine, or is it? I don't know why I always have high expectations for excellent services at high-end places like this. My server was impatient and passive-aggressive. I don't think he was having a good day. So whatever. The table next to us sensed his attitude, and they tried to joke around with him (e.g., the server was like do you want to a refill of red wine, the patron responded with I'd like a refill of grape juice), and the server did not have it at all.Honestly, in my limited experience at high-end restaurants, I don't believe I've encountered anyone yet where I was like okay this person entirely deserves a 20% tip. In fact, it is always these family-run businesses where I'd feel welcomed and be willing to tip 20% wholeheartedly.The biggest let down was dessert. I had Molten Chocolate Cake for $9 (Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Melted Chocolate). First of all, I've had plenty of salted caramel ice cream, and I was like why do I get vanilla ice cream? Or was this like extra light caramel? And then where is the melted chocolate? I got like a piece of chocolate-flavored cupcake. Huh? Never again.","4, 1, 3, 4, 4"

I had no idea they were so popular. I made my pick-up order via Grubhub and applied their $7 off promo, resulting in my total charge being only $4.82 - I ordered Tarka Dal. It was accompanied with basmati rice and a side of red chutney (?) Not sure if I was supposed to receive complimentary naan with it or... I do feel as if that was the missing component to this.All in all, I was pleased with my meal. I haven't had Indian cuisine in many years; I'm glad it was this restaurant that I chose to order from. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I have to specifically request utensils to-go but I didn't receive any in my bag. I had to duck into Star Market to grab some. Not worth knocking a star off though.> Nom nom nom. First this was delicious, however door dash took TWO HOURS so I was hangry when I dug in and can't in good conscience give a five star with hangry eating. Keema Nan and Keema Pratha were standard good - 3 stars. Husband had Chicken Madras and consumed 75% of it and a vegetable samosa. He gave the chicken madras 3.5 stars because it exploded with flavor. The Samosa gets 4 stars from him due to flavor and the dough. I thought there was too much dough and meh flavor. Lamb Shahi Koorma was delicious. The sauce was as expected hot/spicy and creamy and perfect for a winter night. I liked all the flavors and spices, but I think they could have kicked it up a little, I'm always afraid to ask for more. There is a fine line between spicy and nuclear explosion spicy. The lamb was really what pushed this to a 4 star range. It was delightful. Not chewy, could cut it with my fork. And there was a lot of it. And it tasted like lamb, many times I find the flavor is lost in the spice. Not here!All in we will return. We won't ever DoorDash from there again (they did refund our order), but I blame the driver.> My friend and I stopped by to have lunch, the food was out of this world, staff was friendly . If I could give them 10 stars, I would. I love to cook, and I am very picky when it comes to eating out. Zabardast khana!!!!! Shukeria> We love the food at Punjab Palace! We had a great delivery experience through them using Grub Hub. Everything was excellent. We had onion bhaji, my favorite, coconut soup, saag paneer, lamb saag -love saag! Also chicken korma &naan. Ordered medium spice level, it was all wonderful. Oh, and the best sweet lassi, correctly made with a hint of rose water. We're stuffed!> I have heard that Cambridge has way better I dian food than Boston, but coming here proved this wrong! I have learned that Boston can do Indian food great too. The food  was authentic and in large portion sizes. The garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all really good. They also offer a curried onion dish as a freebie. I would recommend coming with friends so you're able to try an array of different dishes!! The space was also very calm and not crowded (came on a weekday for lunch). Very pleased with my experience and recommend this place for anyone craving a great, authentic Indian meal.","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

The ambiance is nice and we were able to find parking both times. Both times we got great bartenders. The service is really friendly and able to make menu suggestions. I do think their cocktails are a little too sugary sweet for me but overall I really enjoy the restaurant.> Decided to stop by Dryft having come across articles about its opening and great menu. We made reservations for a weekend and got seated at the exact time, not a minute more or less which was really something to note. The restaurant had a good ambience with some beaty music and a great view. The service was warm and friendly and we were given a few recommendations on asking. Our drinks were good and the bar menu has a decent selection to chose from. The 2 starters we opted for were: - The Mediterranean platter which could have been better but was tasty nevertheless - The Shrimp Kabob was a blast of flavours, although the quantity / portions ought to be more. We knocked the plate clean in just a few seconds - Our main course included the burger, chicken under a brick and gnocchi. We weren't taken away by these dishes, they were hearty however lacked the punch it needed. The gnocchi had an odd aftertaste, one that I haven't had before. Overall, the seafood here seems to be the better bet so explore those the next time you head here. The menu is a concise one at the moment and I do hope they add a few more options to the roster, dessert as well. Would definitely give Dryft another visit!> Great end of job dinner spot. This is where we finished our project end of job party. What a great place. Awesome staff ....from our waitress D ,she was amazing, to the food and drinks that came out.... 20 people and they never missed a beat. This place is a must try... all the dishes were excellent. Wish we would have found it sooner. #BuddhaReview> My hubby picked me up from the station from work and we were both hungry. He wanted some burgers but I wanted some fish dish. So as usual I yelped something around the area. I've seen this one before when it was hot and new but haven't had the chance to actually check out the place. We ended up agreeing on coming here. It was quiet that afternoon, we got sat pretty quick since there was literally like 3 people in the bar and that's it, no one was dining on the tables. We also got to choose where we wanna sit. We ordered and had some drinks. The food was good, it also came at a timely manner, service was alright. The manager was nice enough to give my husband another beer on the house since I think they know each other from way back. I got some pics of my food and I would go back next time when given the chance.> It's a new year and Dryft is bringing some style and your next date night to Revere. At the wonderland t stop, it's wonderfully convenient to get to. The place is a bit small but it looks like they'll have a patio for the summer months so lookout brunch Sundays!I came here a few times. I got the lobster fra diavolo and the bolonese the second. Both were very good and as they find their stride I only expect it to get better. Dessert is rotating but the night I got the lemon cake , it was sublime. The cocktails aren't too shabby either.","5, 4, 5, 4, 5"

I've been around typically during off hours so it's always been pretty available. I will say the service is incredible, our waitress was very attentive! Next time I'm gonna stick with my favorites the salmon and avocado and the eel avocado roll. The yellowtail was good but I was left craving my favorite.> After coming back here for lunch a couple times, I think my rating veers closer to a 3. The tori no karaage is breaded well enough though it's more flaky than crispy. The chirashi bowl was definitely instaworthy but the content (fish and tamago) were not particularly strong. The tamago was vaguely sweet but it didn't leave much of a strong impression. The seafood (tuna, salmon, shrimp, whatever else I can't remember) was decently fresh but reminded me more of fish from AYCE sushi. Finally, the amount of rice given was maybe a bit too generous since I finished maybe three quarters to three fifths of the rice before calling a day. Not my first choice for sushi by any stretch but definitely enough for a quick craving if I really need to satisfy my cravings.IG: Mood4foodeatery> My second meal at Fin's just a short walk away from the Boylston T stop was the better of the two.Service was a bit overeager, with her taking away the chopstick wrapper that I had folded into a tent to set my chopsticks upon, and the clean napkin which I had moved off the appetizer plate.Their menu is new, and the Chilean seabass I had my eye on was no longer on it.  Instead, I ordered their Pork Belly Bun $7 appetizer and the Beef Don $15 House Entree that is served with miso soup.  The soup arrived hot, with a generous scatter of tiny diced tofu.  The pair of steamed buns were filled with two slices of pork belly apiece.  Though not quite melty, the belly meat was still quite good.  The rice bowl with beef and onion was a good portion, though the vegetables being but sliced raw cucumber and some of those yellow pickled daikon was a bit light.  The meat was cut thin and well done, so it was a bit tough as well.  However, the well flavored soft sliced onions more than made up for it, and the sauce melded with the rice as well.Another table near by ordered the salmon and soybean fried rice, and it looked pretty good and was portioned as an entree.4 stars.***There was a wait at Fin's Sushi & Grill on a Friday evening, reminding me that they are located a short walk from the T by the Theater District.  So I opted to get my meal to go.I wanted noodles, so I got the Yaki Noodles with Beef $12 (with Udon!).  The wait was short - just over 10 min.  The noodles hot and slippery soft tender, the veggies (mostly onions, sweet cabbage, bok choy, green and red bell peppers) crisp, the beef though, cut into short strips, were super well done and dry.  2 star dish.On another visit I gave the Udon Yaki Noodles another chance with Seafood for $14.  The seafood was shrimp, scallop, and calamari.  The shrimp were tail on and overcooked.  The scallop were thin pieces and overcooked.  The calamari were rounds and rubbery.  Sense a theme?  Even some of the vegetables mixed with the noodles were overcooked on this go around.  2 stars.Averaging to 3 stars.Since my orders were to go, I didn't have the chance to comment on my dinners to the staff.Perhaps I'll give their sushi a go?Fin's Special Roll $7 shrimp tempura, peach, cucumber, mayo, bean sprouts, with eels sauce on topUna-Avo $7Grilled Vegetable Roll $5Scorpion Maki $10 grilled eel, cucumber, avocado and tobiko wrapped with shrimp and eel sauceSpider Maki $10 deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, with masago, spicy mayo, and eel sauceRock 'N' Roll $7 fish tempura, cucumber, spicy mayo & eel sauceGrilled salmon Roll $7 grilled salmon with cucumber, scallions, and eel sauceVegetable Poke Bowl $15 with sushi rice or field green salad,  Avocado, mango, Japanese bean sprouts, strawberry, scallions, seaweed, red onion, sesame seeds, mixed with Japanese dressingOther thoughts:A combo appetizer meal of Beef Dumpling Soup $5 and Avocado Salad $6Chashu Miso Ramen in Soup $15Unagi Fried Rice $11Pork Katsu with curry sauce $16***Starter: Agadashi Tofu $5Entree: Grilled Eel Ramen $15The crisp shell of the tofu sogged up quickly in the sweet sauce, so eat it quick.  But the portion was an acceptable count of 6 cubes.The ramen was okay, but bean sprouts took over the bowl and the toppings were mild.  The eel, 5 thin slices, wasn't quite satisfying enough, and too soft to provide any contrast with the soupy noodles in terms of texture.  Perhaps I ought to have tried the duck instead?3 stars.***Okay, I had a chat with the staff.  They tend to overcook their beef because their clientele prefers the beef fully cooked, so just ask for it to be prepared ""medium.""  I'll have to give that a try sometime.I'll allow a 4 star average on this set till I test it out.> I have mixed feelings about this place!  I come here mostly for the Yaki Ramen with chicken! Best Japanese stir fried noodle in town!! I discovered this when I worked at Massachusetts General Hospital at their Beacon st location and was very excited when they opened up in Chinatown. Taking off one star for charging $1 for a drop of hot sauce!! FYI: if you want hot sauce (sriracha) to dip in on the side, they will charge you $1. When I asked the waitress she said at the other table someone asked for  mayonnaise sauce and that is $2. I think this is too much since you can get the whole bottle for $3 and we just want a little bit to make our food spicy!! There is no cooking or prepping needed to the sriracha> I've always passed this location and didn't really think much of it until my friend wanted to eat here. I must say, this place exceeded my expectations! The fish for the sushi and donbori was very fresh and the portion cut were well worth the price. The ramen was where i had to deduct points. The broth was very... generic. It tasted similar to the powdered broth you get with packaged ramen. Not that it wasn't tasty, but it wasn't anything special. In general, stick to sushi!","4, 3, 4, 4, 3"

The food is so good I don't care. They need to open a location in Hyde Park. 5 stars> Yummy food, excellent value, and speedy eats. Ordered delivery via DoorDash and it was at my door within 25 minutes despite an estimated time of 40 minutes. We ordered the rotisserie chicken plate with two sides  (rice with peas, fried green bananas) and the fried pork plate with two sides (cassava and sweet plantains). The chicken was great -- the breast was a little dry but the drumstick was fall off the bone and the skin was tasty and well-seasoned. I found the fried green bananas a little tasteless but the rice with peas was good, savory and fragrant. The fried pork wasn't exactly fried and it was a little dry to boot, but the sweet plantain was over the top delicious.Overall for $30, you get enough food to last 2 meals per entree, easily. Fun place for takeout! I'm no expert on Dominican food but I enjoyed my meal!> Ordered delivery from here and I'm angry at myself for not discovering this place sooner. I tried the fried pork (carne sabrosura) combo with green plantains and cassava, and the fried chicken (capitaleño) combo with sweet plantains and fried rice (chofan). The prices were a bit higher than what is on their website ($13.50 each rather than $11.50 on the website) but this may be because I ordered delivery.The meat was on the dry side but the portions were huge! Despite the meat being dry, it was super flavorful. The sides were also very tasty. I think the fried rice is a good deal because they give so much and the rice itself has pieces of meat in it, so somebody could definitely eat it alone as a meal.Their other meat options sound awesome (chicharrones or rotisserie chicken) and I hope to try their other sides soon.> What a gem! I stopped by for a late night dinner and honestly wasn't expecting much. But it's great food, quick, and super cheap. I haven't had Dominican food before, and this left a really good impression. We got the medium combo sabrosura for dinner (and wasn't able to finish) as well as a passion fruit milk. First, the passion fruit drink is super refreshing and tasty. It's better than all the passion fruit drinks I've had at any boba shop. The combo was also good; we got the rice with peas and fried plantains as sides. I loved everything, except the plantains. They were a little dry and flavorless. In terms of ambiance, there really isn't any. Very hole in the wall restaurant with limited seating. It's best for a grab and go meal. Other than this, I tried a new place and will probably have cravings for their food soon.> Small place but yummy food. A good place to pick up a quick meal. Street parking. Menu is also in English for those who don't understand espanol like me. But just point point point, and boom.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

All of their staff is super nice. Although it gets busy at lunchtime, they have their prep down to a science. I've never needed to wait for more than 10 minutes.  My go-to's are the BLT and the turkey club on white (turkey club comes with fries!). Portions are very generous, and their sandwich lettuce is excellent.Overall, if you're north of DTX near the state house and looking for somewhere casual and delicious for lunch, this is the place for you.> Go here for breakfast at least once a week. The staff is very nice and everyone is cheerful. The prices are cheaper but you can definitely find the same thing cheaper around the corner. The quality of the food is good, you won't get it smothered in oil or butter, it will be just right. Havent had a dish here that i havent liked. The haddock, the breakfast, and the salmon are my favorites. The chicken wing special is good too! Oooo and the pesto chicken! Go here- tell them i sent you :)> First time visit from out of town. Was pleasantly surprised that a basic roasted turkey deli sandwich was actually delicious! Every bite, even the pickles and greens in the sandwich were flavorful. Nicely done! If I lived in The Boston area I'd be regular.> My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast on our first morning in Boston. It was located directly across from our Airbnb, so naturally we had to try it out. There was quite a line signaling to me that their food had to be good. There are plenty of tables inside where you can enjoy your food, or many of the people I saw come through ordered theirs to go. We decided to eat in. I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a toasted everything bagel. My boyfriend got the ham, egg, and cheese on a toasted plain bagel. HOLY COW! They were both delicious. Boston bagels are truly to die for. I don't know what it is, but they taste so different from ours back home. We each also had a cup of their freshly brewed coffee, and enjoyed it. I can be picky when it comes to coffee, but theirs passed the test. It was a perfect temperature to walk around the city streets of a chilly Boston morning. Overall, great little deli spot. Breakfast was fantastic, so I can only imagine their lunch is good too! I did notice that they're only open for breakfast and lunch, so make sure you stop by early enough to try it out.> This place is amazing!!!! I am reluctant to write this because if more people come then there will be less for me, but a last the breakfast croissant with egg and cheese is the most amazing sandwich on the planet.  In addition their Salmon special is wonderfully prepared.  While I don't eat chicken I know that my coworkers go crazy for it.  They also make a great tuna sandwich. Aside from the food, the staff are truly pleasant and that's the best part of high spot!","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

The type of food served here was so unique and unlike anywhere else I've tried - definitely Boston's most intriguing seafood restaurant. Bring a friend here who thinks she / he isn't a seafood fan and I promise they will be swayed. However, there are land options as well for the hard-headed non-seafood lovers such as Maine lamb shoulder. The chopped tuna crudo was a combination of curried chickpeas and typical tuna crudo - delicious! People rave about Frank Pepe's white clam pizza but if you haven't had that yet, come here instead and taste the best chopped clam pizza you've ever had. I'll definitely be back.> Came here just for the cocktails. Compared to other locations, their drinks are pretty mediocre. My husband and I ordered a total of 5, and I only really liked one of them - Sangre y arena Atmosphere at the bar was okay- it felt very tight and overcrowded.I would recommend sitting for dinner and not coming for just the bar. I am not a huge oyster fan but the people near us ordered them and loved it! Also the French fries looked and smelled fantastic!> Great date spot - nice lighting, good service and fun cocktails. That said it just isnt as good as Alden and harrow and as many reviews said the prices are barely justify the steep prices.We had the artichoke, smoked mackeral, whit pizza and fish sticks. The smoked mackerel was the best dish. The smokiness of the fish complimented the creaminess of the sauce. Almost an umami experience.The artichoke was solid. White fish pizza was a total miss - as many said it is too salty. The crust was yummy - great everything bagel flavor.Fish sticks were also salty. Perfectly fried but nothing special.> The food at Waypoint was solid and I'd definitely come back again. Let's get the petty stuff out the way first, our server looked angry the entire night. Dropped stuff off and walked away without us ever getting the opportunity to ask what each dish was or if we needed anything else...For the apps, the lobster toast was fine but the menu fails to mention the copious amount of celery that hits your face when you take a bite. Crab fries were phenomenal and one of my favorite dishes of the night, so well seasoned along with the chili mayo dipping sauce.We got 2 pastas (lobster cacio e pepe and uni bucatini) and they were both pretty bad. Dry, under seasoned, and cold. These dishes nearly ruined the meal for us, just avoid their pasta dishes altogether.For entrees we got the chopped clam pizza. First time having something like that took a few bites to acclimate but overall I enjoyed it. Had a nice kick and flavorful. We also steak tartare, char belly, and lobster tails. Lobster tails were really tasty and my favorite dish of the night. The belly was bland and had bones in it so pass.Bonus points for having a good mocktail menu. Overall it was good but some misses in between.> Came here for a Valentine's Day dinner celebration and was so happy to have found this place! The staff were very kind and friendly. I had requested for a booth and they were able to provide me with a booth table (thank you!). We ordered the crab fries as an appetizer which was a must get!! We then got the clam pizza which was out of this world delicious! Another must get. The salmon crudo was nice and refreshing, but can be omitted. We then got the caramel dessert which was a flan-like dessert. It had hints blackberries and was a nice refreshing end to our dinner. I would definitely recommend !","5, 3, 3, 4, 5"

We went around 7:30 PM on a Friday night expecting a wait but were lucky to get seated immediately (the place was still pretty busy).This place is casual sit-down with a takeout option. The rotating pillars of gyro meat in the kitchen make it seem like one of those gyros places but then the front of the house is a casual sit-down dining area. We were dining in and were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service, both the polite and attentive waitress and the speed at which the food came.FOOD: We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip to share and then I had the Lamb Chili and the Original Pork Gyro for dinner. I would recommend all 3 dishes and wish I could have gotten more (but I was full!). The Spinach and Artichoke dip was very tasty and came with this delicious warm pita that I started eating alone once we ran out of the dip (my only wish is that there was more dip!). The Lamb Chili was perfectly spiced and warming on a cold evening in December. Lastly, the Gyros is very large and stuffed with veggies and tzatziki, in addition to tons of pork. Perhaps the best thing we had was the side of fries. They were thick-cut but crispy on the outside but warm and potatoey on the inside. Perfect fries!Next time we come back, I would like to try the Meze!> There aren't a lot of good Greek places north of Boston where you can get a fresh Gyro. At $14, with a side, it's a good deal. Lots of meat, very fresh & tasty. It's on the outskirts of Assembly Row, but worth a stop if you're craving something a bit different. Grab it to go, or sit at one of their hight tops.> My favorite Greek spot in Boston. The gyros are delicious and made with great pita and fresh ingredients. I always ask for hot sauce on the side to spice things up. Their roasted red pepper dip is like crack. Get it. Also the Greek fries are so good. You'll definitely leave here full as the portions are great. Everything is quality here and I highly recommend> I absolutely love this place. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean/Greek cuisine so I was happy that this place opened near my workplace. I come here for lunch at least once a week, and I'm obsessed with the Greek salad with chicken. The veggies are always fresh and crunchy, the chicken is always juicy and flavorful, and they have these carbonated lemonade drinks that have enough tang to satisfy you. The baklava isn't bad either.The service is fantastic as well, everyone is super friendly, and there are a few tables, along with some high top seating.> Arrived on a Sunday evening with a friend, excited to try a new Greek place. We were seated immediately and our waiter was consistently attentive to us during our meal. While there were plenty of appetizer and main course options on the menu, we chose the Mediterranean salad ($11), Original Gyro ($14, comes with pork and fries), and Beef Kalamaki skewers ($15). First off, this place has some cute interior designing that I'd imagine is reminiscent of Greece. I remember we were seated by a nice painting. Food came out relatively quickly and served hot. I wouldn't say there was anything special about the salad, but the way the meat is cooked here is different and tasty! Hope to visit another time and try some of their other offerings!","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The English muffin was so soft that I'm craving it right now. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Boston. Next time I will be ordering the dish my husband ordered which is French toast and chicken. That dish came with whip cream on the side and omg it was sooooooo good.> Stopped in for Sunday brunch to celebrate my friend's half marathon finish. The restaurant was full, but not packed and our server was great! They have an extensive cocktail list with some really fun options--even one with gummy sharks--but I opted for one of their many beers on tap. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict, one of many Benedict's they offer on the menu. My dish was pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular. We did have to wait an hour for the food and our server informed us that the kitchen staff was short one person so everything was backed up. He was kind enough to comp our meal given that we waited so long and so patiently, which we thoroughly appreciated.> Made my 2 year old daughter cry.  Shocking experience where the waiter mean, rude and unapologetic in aggressively and abruptly taking way simple sugar packets she was happily playing with.  I called the GM over to explain and she has but a few words to say, none of which were an apology. This is not the first time we had a similar experience to the first of this extreme. I hope this review serves as a wake up call for Brownstone.> 2 stars for the food and zip for service. Took over an hour to get brunch and a coffee, when we finally got the check (didn't look at it at first) and paid the bill came back at $50 for 2 coffees and 2 egg plates, the receipt itself was not included.After getting someone's attention they said the manager would be right on it, 10 minutes and a few apologies later the hostess drops off a correct check with no service recovery, visit from the manager, etc.Had to leave and run back to work after the extra-long lunch so didn't get to confront the manager about the lack of concern about overcharging people who might not pay more attention to what they're paying for but this is the kind of thing that'll make me never go to a place again. Trust matters.> We've visited the restaurant for brunch on a Sunday at noon and had a good number of tables available. This restaurant is located in the heart of Boston in Backbay and is conveniently close to Copley Place and Prudential. PROS:- Good selection of brunch choices at a very decent price (average at $10-$14 a dish) - Historic ambiance with window seatings that open up. - Food was delish - the avocado toast was perfect and the french toast with the blueberry compote was great. - Full drink menu to choose from (mimosas, coffees, beers, etc) CONS:- Parking is tough if you're driving to dine here and they do not offer parking validation.- Service was a bit slow as the waitstaff only refilled water once when we are already done with our meal and was ready for the check.Overall, I would have to rate this place a 3.5/5.","5, 3, 1, 2, 3"

Seating was amazing! The sun was streaming into our private dining room and our server Ari was super efficient and kind. Huge thanks to Kate for seating us in such an ideal spot. The secret is to arrive at 10-10:30am!! We beat the lines and had an amazing morning. We can't say enough to thank you and your chefs for such a great beginning to a wonderful day.> Very chill. Great patio seating in the summer. Dive bar seating in winter.Standard fries are the best of all time. Get the Frozen Cobra's Fang in the summer. Changed my life.> Came here on a foodie tour and had a really interesting dish: pickled eggs!! The flavor was great but what really stood out to me was their homemade signature hot sauce. It was a really amazing blend of flavors. Overall I really want to come back here on a night out!! The atmosphere was really cool and i loved all the old fashioned dive bar games.> Eh. EH. EHHH. Epic fail State Park. Yes, the vibes and location are spot on but the whole experience last night fell SO short I will not recommend this place to anyone.My man and I came in for the dollar oyster special they offer for Monday nights (10-12am) and were highly disappointed by what went down. There was one bartender on with what seemed to be an aloof female barback. Working in the industry, it really makes me cringe writing this but I still have those ODD vibes a day later. This is DEFINITLY an industry spot, yet, we don't work in Cambridge so we weren't down with the ordinary crew.We sat at the bar and the bartender checked my ID, then asked if he checked my ID shortly after. Um....yes you checked my ID. Are we in the twilight zone, or are you in the twilight zone? We then ordered 12 oysters, and when they came out they were served PLAIN. No cocktail sauce, no horseradish, no oil, and a flimsy wedge of slimey lemon. YUM?We then asked the female barback if they had any condiments for the oysters, she literally looked at us like we were aliens visiting earth and said no and walked away. Odd that on the regular menu the oysters say they are served with condiments. We wouldn't even care if we had to pay more but just a straight out no is kinda offsetting. Okay cool.We then didn't have any interaction with either of them for the rest of the experience. The bartender had all of his boys slugging those high lifes when he was ignoring guests at the bar. There was a couple next to us that was literally standing waving to get the check. Not really sure if the staff was feeling toasty themselves, which is why they felt the need to literally ignore us the ENTIRE time.Just when you think it can't get any worse, yes, there is icing on the cake. After waiving the barback down she says she can't run credit cards so be  prepared to wait longer, just fair warning. EXACT WORDING.Honestly, at this point we should of just walked out. What kind of place is this? I'm confused.Was really expecting a better experience. Boo State Park.> Arguably the best bar ever. Dark. Mountains. People are amazing. Food rivals anyone. Get the chicken sandwich. Really busy the best omaacr ever. Compare everyone to them!!!","5, 3, 5, 2, 5"

M and I really enjoyed eating here and will be returning for sure! I got the American wagyu shoyu ramen and it was really delicious. Not too salty. The meat was so tender! I also got the egg for $2 extra and I think it was worth it. It was perfectly cooked and so flavorful! (Cooked in soy sauce I think)M got the tan tan noodles and he liked it. Each bowl was $15 and the portions were not big. (M ended up picking up salmon sashimi from the grocery store and ate it at home after .)There's also ample seating and we look forward to bringing a group of friends here!> I don't recommend their ramen; the broth can be considered ""refreshingly light"" but I honestly thought it was bland. Noodle texture was also questionable for thing noodles.Otherwise, I liked the Aburasoba. I recommend that to those who like it.3/5> I came here when it just opened. The menu was pretty concise and most of the base was beef broth. They have specials on their menu too. When I was there, they were serving short rib ramen. Miso Ramen: I think it's pretty good. Portion is on the smaller side so might not be enough for some people. The broth was creamy and has the perfect amount of flavor. Noodles are great. The slices of Wagyu beef on top was tender. Overall I loved it! 5/5 Service/Space: This is located in the Maruichi food market. There were only two people working in the station. It's a kind of self-serving situation. I was surprised by how fast they served our ramen despite having to take orders and cook at the same time. The service was also great. They made sure our ramen was nicely presented too. There are plenty of seats in the food market! 5/5Parking/Transportation: This is located in Coolidge Corner, 5min walking from the Coolidge corner T stop. There are metered parking around. I'll definitely come back and try their specials!> Reasonably priced and a good portion that's filling but not ""grip your belly"" uncomfortably filling. At 15/bowl it was worth it for the yummy broth, choice of noodle and flavorful toppings (bamboo, corn, soft boiled egg, nori).My tan-tan men came with ground beef but others such as the shoyu and miso have American wagyu. My bf got the chashu ramen which had a flavorful sesame-y broth but the pork was a bit dry as it was missing the fat cap. The service was fast as we were served within 10 minutes. It's located within the old Gen Sou En building that's now a Japanese grocery store. We ate and then roamed and bought Japanese snacks which were surprisingly inexpensive. Japanese snacks (pocky, hi-chew, rice crackers, etc) I found we're cheaper than C-Mart.> We went to this new restaurant located in Maruichi market.They have ramen and Okonomiyaki We tried Aburasoba and Okonomiyaki.Aburasoba(no broth ramen with toppings and Pork rib&)It was very flavorful and noodle was chewy Okonomiyaki ( savory pancake with cabbage and egg )It was really like the one we had in Japan.We liked both and need to come back to try other things too.","5, 3, 5, 4, 5"

But I am not a fan of the texture on their Richie's Slush. Seems like its a lil over frozen. I love how friendly everyone is here and the food is amazing> Chicken patties are the best in the city. Aside from the occasional mix up where they will give me a beef patty instead for the curry chicken (even though they are marked off for distinction). (Confuses face?)> I was waiting for my friends to come over for dinner and needed a quick snack, so I walked over. If you go there close to closing time, be aware that they may not have a full menu. I got their fish sandwich and a vegetable patty. The such sandwich was . I was really grateful that they had so many options for vegetarians. Fish, soy, vegetable patties, etc. They make their own hot sauce and that is dope--isn't was delicious! BUT they charge 50 cents per container, that sucks because the container is so small.> I ordered an meal for pick during my lunch hour at work, and it was ready to go in the time period they mentioned so this was great. I ordered the jerk chicken which I thought had a more dense gravy like sauce to it than I would have liked which created a different taste in the chicken, but the rice and peas that went with it were decent, the cole slaw the meal came with was ok, and the beef patty was also ok, it tasted like the premade beef patties you buy at the grocery store so it was fine. However, the 2 employees that were there were very polite and friendly so I would like to potentially give it another chance.","4, 4, 2, 4, 4"

Plus, the dude taking our orders seemed genuinely delighted to take us through the Bon Me experience. The dining room was well-maintained, the tables busses and the trash zone kept spotless. Tack new  flatware on to the whole shebang and you've got yourself an easy bump up to four stars!> I love Bon Me! Great place to go in the weekends because it's not usually busy.The only issue is that I usually have to wait a while for my food, even when I'm the only one there. I would strongly recommend ordering in advance on the Bon Me website.> Slowly STEALING from their customers!I come here from work almost once a week for over a year. They use to give you good portions but now they started scamming their customers by skimming on the sizes. They switched from the large circle flat bowls  to these new stocky ones and now every time I go back they are filling the bowls less and less but raising the prices on you. The chicken udon soup use to be 11 something, now it's $13 something WITH HALF THR BOW FILLED! This disrespect won't be tolerated. Do NOT come here> My go to meal is the K-town throwdown. I prefer to order in store cause I find that they process in store orders more quickly (which is a plus) but there is also online ordering which is great if you time it correctly.

Got delivery from here. It's priced a little bit lower another Indian places and they definitely have a lower delivery minimum.  The food itself tasted good, though a bit different from all other Indian places.  For example: the naan had a different consistency and didn't have the soft and flakey texture of most naan. Perhaps prepackaged. Also, the aloo ghobi was in a tomato sauce versus a light oil and tomato base. And they didn't send onion chutney which I'm used to getting with my meal.But still tasty and I'd order again.> This is my go to Indian cuisine in Boston!

It's sort of like a craft beer gastropub meets dive bar- and I mean that in the best way possible. It's a small place with maybe 6 tables and a decent sized bar. There are also three huge TVs which had two football games on while we were there. The draft list is extensive and has a ton of local offerings. Most of the list is from MA, NH, CT, and NY which is nice to see. They also have a huge selection of burgers. I tried the Ladder 21 burger which was served with cheese, lettuce, chipotle aioli, and fried jalapeños. Nice and spicy without being overwhelming. Sides are a la carte, with fries costing an extra $2. The fries were great. My husband tried the onion straws and those were really good too! Renegade's is a great place to grab a quick burger- we'll be back for sure.> Great little bar in E. Boston/Winthrop!!  We drive by here all the time and always talk about stopping in. We finally did and I loved it. They didn't have a huge tap list, maybe 12 beers, bu it was solid and offered a good variety. They also have a good bourbon selection. Our bartender, Hannah, was really friendly and knowledge. She knew her beers and bourbons. She provided several good recommendations. The food looked really good. My friend ordered the pork cracklins and loved them. They come out hot and still popping. I can't wait to go back. If I could give 4.5 I would.*************************************I really liked this place as you can tell from my initial review. I wish there was a way to post a second review instead of just updating. Anyway....I had a chance to come back and was excited. I tried to order a Bulleit Bourbon and was told they don't carry it. I asked for a list and was told that they rotate their bourbons and therefore don't have a list. Funny!  They also rotate their beers and have a list on the wall. I explained that I couldn't really read the bottles. The print isn't that big and so I think that's reasonable. The bartender didn't offer to make any recommendations so I just went with Makers. For my next drink I tried to order a double and she simply respond, ""Single"".  OK then!!I'm hanging out and all of a sudden the bartender cranks up the music. The place is small and all the table and seats at the bar were full. The music could be heard just fine even over the buzz of the people. I'm not sure why you would turn up the music. What's funny about this move is that the couple next to me at the bar had ordered a salad and a chicken sandwich. They were delivered a salad and two chicken sandwiches. They were right in front of the bartender and she didn't get it right and this was before she turned up the music. As you would expect nobody could hear each other because of the music so everyone is talking louder aka yelling. I know they have good burgers. I ordered the Ladder 21. A burger with chipotle aoli, fried jalapeños, pepper jack, avocado, and Cajun seasoning with a side of onion rings. I love onion rings. I was looking forward to them. Guess what?  She didn't hear me apparently and I got fries instead. I was let down. Turn down the music!!  The bartender comes back about a minute later and asks how my burger is. I clearly hadn't taken a bite and she clearly didn't care because as soon as the question left her mouth she started talking to the people behind me. It really goes to show the difference a good bartender makes and I think the reviews from my two visits show that. This bartender, Katie, I believe, couldn't care less, especially if you weren't a regular. This visit was on 1/10/2020. I'll come back, but if I see this bartender and it's busy I'll likely leave.P.S.  Then there's a twist. The bartender never took my card and didn't know what I ordered. I had to recap my night for her and for some reason she decided to comp a drink. It's a nice gesture yet unwarranted. Should it impact my review?  That's your call.> ive never in my life been so embarrassed in my life and I'm in going to continue coming to this bar just to make this bartenders life miserable. i came here at 12:30 my friend and boyfriend were drinking here literally an hour before and she thought she left her bag there at the bar and we went back to check. im going to be completely honest we were those people that walked into a bar and went into a bathroom both of us because we are girls and thats what we do. the drunk blonde bartender with her hair down decides to pound on the door and as i am peeing she breaks the door open and says ""one person in the bathroom"" and walks away... mind you i am mid pee. i then leave the bathroom to let the other person pee since she was so mad and every person at the bar turns and looks around to me and the bartender continues to talk about the situation to every guest and not even have the nerve to come up to me and speak to me to tell me i was wrong. while she is looking bad speaking nonsense to her customers she takes a shot behind the bar and looks right at me and laughs. shes clearly drunk managing this entire restaurant. renegades what a good look this is. a drunk bartender yelling at women who just spent money at your bar. i literally live down the street and come to this bar on the regular. thanks for the embarrassment! ill make sure to let everyone know to avoid the drunk blonde bartender.> The food and atmosphere is good but I am a localin the area and every time I come here I get poor service and rude staff. I will never recommend this place to anyone and I will never go there again.> I like what they're doing here and I'm amazed at the transformation of this place from when I used to live in Eastie and it was Jimmy Mags and then the Victory pub.

For what it's worth, this Shake Shack is a fairly new location that opened up a couple of months ago so I am not sure if they figured out how to use their personnel effectively for workflow. Either way, there are kiosks for people using credit cards and then the register for pretty much everyone else who has cash. Online orders wait right by the soda fountain. I was readily willing to burn my Shake Shack online order promo after a long day dealing with health insurance shenanigans at work. I placed my order online with a projected pick up time of about 3:45 or so (?) and got there around that time. I think I got my order of two shack burgers and fries around 4 or so. It was difficult to discern whether or not this was because other people like me were doing online orders and caused a backlog or whatnot. Either way, the burgers were steaming hot and the fries were crispy and salted just the right amount, matching the standards set by the rest of the Shake Shacks. I think they are probably still trying to figure out the best way to use their personnel to maximize speed/efficiency so I will cut some slack.

Humans are the problem). After 15 min wait with sparse customers in line, I got my order. They managed to get it wrong and had to remake the order. Another 15 min wait- for a burger. I'm able to write this review and edit while I wait, gives you an idea how long it is gonna be if you come here.During the long wait I saw staff standing around staring at the ceiling, another moving plates from one side of the kitchen to another, only to move them back again few minutes later- pretend busywork, clearly lacking in direction or any motivation whatsoever. I was standing in front of the ceiling gazer, eagerly waiting for my food, not a single question... the apathy and indifference is pretty astounding... Why would you need robot kiosks if you hire all these people to stand around doing nothing in the first place?Serious lack of management/supervision for something as simple as running a fast food chain. Will never bother with this hole again. Go to the McD across the street.> Very nice location conveniently on Washington street. Very lofty and a great seating area. Food is the same as you would find any other shake shack. My only concern is homeless people come in and bother the clientele for money. They really need security here.> Awesome new shake shack location in downtown Boston! Perfect place to grab a quick lunch on the go or grab a seat and hang out for a bit. There's a few booths, tables, and window seating. I came here with a group of friends on opening day and received a special Boston shake shack t-shirt! The staff was very welcoming and just like many of their other locations you can either order at the counter or on one of their iPads if you're paying with credit. I ordered on the iPad and they send you a text when you're order is ready. Super quick service, only 6 mins to get my shack stack, chicken stack, and fries! The shack stack is my favorite go to burger since it has the meat and the cheesy shroom. The fries were crispy and had enough salt, so it makes a perfect addition to your meal! If you're craving a burger, this is definitely a spot to check out!> Been to shake shack MANY times, came into this one for a burger and fries. Got my shack sauce on the side and didn't receive it. Also ordered fries and got about 15 fries, so not worth my money. Never coming back to this location, extremely poorly run. The burger was okay, I've had way better at other locations.","4, 1, 4, 4, 1"

We're staying at a hotel nearby which is in kind of a restaurant desert, but Carmella's was awesome.The prosciutto and provolone and Italian sandwiches were both amazing. The deli meats and cheeses are sliced fresh just for your sandwich, and the bread is delicious and crusty. A large sandwiche here is HUGE -- maybe even 14"" or so, and the small is half that. You can get a drink+chips combo for just $1 extra. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area -- you won't be disappointed!> Nice quiet place, friendly enough. Not too personable for a small deli which I usually appreciate> Almost missed this place - it could use a bit more signage but I am glad I stuck with the search. I ordered an Italian sub with everything and it was very fresh - meat sliced to order, the provolone cheese is not the cheap stuff and is full of flavor and the bread is perfect. The service was very friendly. Oh and order your food with a Polar Orange Dry for a perfect combo. They only have one small table so I walked a block or so west to the Pier park and ate at a picnic table there. Great views and gorgeous park.> Good local sub joint with Italian groceries as well. You get a lot of sub for what you pay!> Best Italian hoagie in east Boston, these guys do it right. Being from philly, Hoagies are a staple of my diet. I've yet to find a hoagie I'm Boston better than this one (just moved here in November) They've got a great selection of meats, cheese, breakfast sandwiches, and hoagies, wall of Italian pasta/cooking items.

Great place to get work done or to just take a breather from work> I was about to drive to Montréal from Boston but first I needed to refuel with a quick breakfast, so luckily I stumbled across Caffe Nero! This small little shop features plenty of sandwiches, pastries, and of course beverages. The staff was friendly enough when I was there and had me in and out pretty quick. I ended up just ordering an orange juice and a small croissant sandwich. I'm not really sure what I expected from the croissant sandwich but it didn't really have much egg or bacon inside of it, it was not very filling, but it did taste pretty good. The orange juice definitely tasted locally made and that was pretty darn good. Overall, this is probably a great place to stop if you drink coffee, but I can't speak on that. What I can say is that they've got some alright food and some banging orange juice. Come check them out for yourself!> I'll stop in on occasion for a caffeine pick-me-up before a show at the Boston Opera House. It always seems busy, but the baristas always seem quick so the line moves along. Love the coffee, although last trip I got a double shot espresso because we were cutting it close. I love the atmosphere here, and the seats are comfy.> This was a cool quiet space. Reminds me of a Starbucks. Everyone just hanging around after buying their drinks. We got the chai latte  and matcha latte. The chai latte was richer in favor and the matcha latte was to milky. Not a bad place to hang around> I have mixed feeling about this coffee place. Although the place is just steps away from my office, I would choose to walk a bit more to Pret to pick up my breakfast in the morning!!* Their croissants are just okay!! Even when I ask to heat up, they are not as crunchy as Pret or Starbuck, so Nero is not my number 1 choice for breakfast in the morning* Staffs friendliness: I have mixed feeling about this too. I guess it depends on who you see, but there're at least 2 staffs that should learn how to smile to customers given a customer facing job. They are grumpy every time I stop by, not just to me and speak to each other in their language. However, there are other people in different shifts who are more CHEERFUL to customers!! A simple smile makes a huge different!!* Drink: I love the mango smoothie here!! Sooo yummy!!! * Setting: nice set up to stay for a catch up with friends or to work or study!!

Five Guys in general tastes like a burger I could make at home and the fries are usually soggy - however, they give a loott. They fill the cup and then add multiple scoops into the bag (1 large fries came with 2.5 cups worth)!!The food isn't the greatest, but it does hit the spot if you're craving it.

This place must have new management or something since all of these negative reviews happened. I had the clan chowder and a burger. Both were hot and great. My food came out super fast. No complaints other than that the beer menu could use some more variety.> We arrived at around 1030pm on a Saturday to check in to the Marriott hotel, where the restaurant is.  We were tired & starving & hoping for a quick & decent bite.  Turns out, our server Patricia was super friendly, & the food here very good.  The bar was pretty busy, & people were getting takeout too.Patricia thoughtfully seated us at a larger booth so we had room to pull up our luggage.  When we told her we were starving & asked if we could order as she seated us, she was ready to go!Literally 5 minutes later, we had a big bowl of hot creamy delicious chowder to share in front of us, with 2 spoons & 2 packets of oyster crackers.Barely 10 minutes after that, & we each had a big, stuffed with lightly mayo'd lobster, lobster roll with sides of melted butter, hot, crispy sweet potato fries & ketchup in front of us.Patricia was on top of her game - checking on us, refilling waters, and being warm & friendly.Amazing service, & very good food!  Perfect!> Great restaurant in a hotel. Our wait staff, Debbie S.  Recommended the lobster roll. WOW!  It was fabulous !  Tons of huge pieces of lobster. My husband's burger was perfect. Delicious restaurant in a hotel. Very surprising!!> I must admit, as a hotel restaurant I was not expecting much. But, we had a great meal!. The restaurant has been newly refurbished. We had a bunch of different food including a salad, chicken nuggets, lobster roll, soup and wine. Everything was great. The service was spot on. Several people helping us. I've seen some the other reviews, and I have to say I don't understand the negative reviews. We loved it. Check it out!!> It took a while to get seated even though there were very few guests. Waitstaff once we were seated were friendly and we had our food quicker than i expected. Food was fine, not amazing, not bad. A little pricey for the quality.","5, 5, 4, 5, 3"

Bottega, the savior of the day! Nothing here is particularly spectacular -- that is, except the TRUFFLE PASTA. Most of the pasta here is good, but when I tell you the truffle pasta with prosciutto here is phenomenal, you better believe it. And an easy $9 dish to boot ;).> Cold gnocchi, cold sauce, and not spicy. I've never heard of gnocchi being served cold, and when I order something with hot peppers next to it on the menu, I expect it to have at least some kick to it. Not sure what we waited for since everything was cold anyway. Felt awkward sitting there, like the guy behind the counter wanted us to leave.> One thing that I heard about this place was that they have $5 pasta on Tuesdays (could be getting the day wrong). I used to live near here so I figured, why not try it out?Honestly, I can't remember which pasta I ordered but it was pretty good! Especially for the value. Seating in here is a nightmare/limited so be prepared for it to be packed/eat outside if you can!> Writing 15 minutes after delivery. Ordered via Yelp (literally Yelp still has delivering tracking going despite it being delivered). The Boy found a hair in his Italian. Even prior to that though, at first bite we found the sandwiches average at best. Honestly below average given that this came from an Italian restaurant. What did it to me is that both of our sandwiches were warm. It's a cold cut deli sandwich shouldn't be served warm. I've never had their pasta but maybe they should stick to that. Definitely hesitant to try it though because of this hair situation.> It's one of the restaurants that it is good/decent but nothing extremely attracting enough to go back for me. The portion of the food is quite small, as compared to what you pay. $13 for a linguine cream shrimp (small size) pasta dish was not satisfying. The sauce was not enough either. I am glad that I tried this place though.","4, 2, 3, 1, 3"

Best Caribbean restaurant in Boston. I recommend everything and definitely the curry mango, curry beef and pelau> Great hole in the wall Caribbean spot. I wish these more commonplace in Boston. The lady working was really friendly and she joked with me about them not serving doubles. Also they are halal, big plus. I got a medium roti (plenty big), with boneless curry chicken, channa, cabbage, and pepper sauce. Probably the most classic roti combo. AND an ginger beer. For the uninitiated here is a quick history/cultural lesson. Caribbean/West Indian food is food from countries like Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana, and Jamaica, NOT India. There is an overlap of seasoning, flavors, and dishes because when Caribbean countries were colonies of the British Empire, indentured servants were brought from India to work the fields since slavery had been made illegal. This lead to Indo-Caribbean's bringing their food and culture to the new land. And so roti exists in a much different form here than it does in the Indian subcontinent. It's NOT a burrito, don't eat it like one. You can eat it with a fork and knife or unwrap it and rip off pieces and scoop the filling with your hand. ~the more u know ~> If you are looking for a quick lunch or take out this is the place to come . Several hot food selections to pick to go with your rice and veggies. Oxtail , curry chicken , shrimp , curry meat , goat etc. prices  are decently priced and there's only one lady to serve you of your selection . Overall it's a good pit stop for a quick eat.> Oh my god! So good.It's always the same order. A small roti with chicken curry. You get two sides with a small roti - I go for the spiced potatoes and the mango curry. The chicken curry is flavored really well, even a small bite is like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. The chicken is seasoned well and tender. As for the sides, the mango curry is a wonderful balance of sweet and spice (and everything nice). The mango itself is cooked well and has a hint of sour to it - goes superbly well with the chicken. The potatoes help balance all the curries. There is a little bit of heat in the curries, some days more than others! I'm not sure what the roti is made of (it's not like the tandoori roti you get at Indian restaurants) but, oh my, it goes well with the curry and the sides. Also, one time, they were out of the roti (we got there 15 mins before closing time). So the staff substituted rice for the roti, which was delicious too!.Don't let the outside fool you. It may not look like much but give the food a try and you'll want it every day. The staff isn't very talkative but they are very nice and accommodating. This is definitely a favorite!> I went here on Saturday, December 14th around 3pm. I got the chicken curry roti and my partner got the shrimp plate. The food was tasty and we loved the hot sauce. However, around 7/8pm my stomach started hurting and I then had the most horrific vomiting and diarrhea in my adult life.  It finally subsided around 2am, but more than 24 hours later I am weak, have a headache, fatigue, and muscle soreness. My partner was fine so it was definitely the chicken and I noticed the chicken wasn't very warm and I suspect that is what caused the food poisoning from hell.","5, 5, 4, 5, 1"

Come for the dessert but must say the Chicken Caprese Sandwich was fantastic, really enjoyed the pesto sauce and the waffle fries dusted in cocoa powder The White Chocolate Russian was one of the best I've ever had, probably because they use their restaurant's white chocolate. Also our server, Zoe was phenomenal! Very personable and extremely attentive. I feel like more often than not at many restaurants the service is lacking just because servers forget to the basics. We later ordered the fondue to share and wow. I wish I brought more friends. The plate is HUGE. Includes a waffle, crepe, strawberries, brownies, and more. I've tried all three of the chocolates you can choose from and I'd say for dipping top two are Milk and Dark chocolate and it's a total tie. Wait for the fondue was a bit long but because of that without us even mentioning anything, Zoe was quick to remove it off the bill which made the trip that much sweeter Anyways definitely the spot for all things dessert! Honestly would suggest coming on an empty stomach and just skipping dinner. So so many awesome menu items and not enough room haha. Can't wait to come back soon!> Located on Boylston Street, across the Pru, is a great chocolate dessert place called Max Brenner! I came here with a bunch of friends on the first day of restaurant week and was a little bummed out they weren't offering any fondue as part of the restaurant week menu, but nevertheless excited to see weekend lunch options. Max Brenner is more on the casual side, so you get 3 courses for $20. Once you walk through the door, you get a sugary whiff of chocolate in their lobby. Our waiter was a bit confused about how the restaurant week menu worked since everyone in our party decided to take advantage of the opportunity. We all ordered and waited at least half an hour and was wondering what took so long for our appetizers to come out. Turns out, they waited until all 3 courses of our orders were ready and starting bringing out the entrees and appetizers at the same time. They were going to bring out the desserts too, but we told them to wait because we hadn't even eaten anything and there was no room on the table. I don't believe this is the first year that Max Brenner has done Restaurant week, so I would have expected servers and staff to know a more efficient way of giving out our food.  Onto the food, I ordered the bbq wings with blue cheese dressing, the cheeseburger with waffle fries, and the chocolate waffles for dessert. The portions were large considering restaurant week usually is given a bit less, so it was definitely the most bang for your buck! the bbq wings were standard and had a good amount of sauce on them to add flavor, but didn't make your hands too messy. The cheeseburger wasn't anything special and the waffle fries were supposed to come with chocolate dusting, but they didn't. :( I was looking forward to chocolate fries, but that extra touch was missing. The waffle fries were a thick cut and crunchy. The highlight of the meal was, of course, the chocolate waffles for dessert. The waffles came with hot melted milk chocolate that you can drizzle over, which added another layer of chocolate. They also came with a side of mushy strawberries. The waffles were good, but I do wish it came with another scoop ice cream to combat the extra sweetness of the chocolate for both waffles. I'd only recommend coming here for the desserts especially if you're having chocolate cravings.> Came here for ""Galentine's day"" to catch up with a friend and we split the sharing fondue with white chocolate and milk chocolate. Fondue is always fun since it's an active experience, but can be quite the sweetness overload even for someone with a sweet tooth! I skipped dinner since I knew it would be a lot of food, and I'm glad I did. The sharing fondue was great because we got to try a good variety of chocolate and desserts.I was nervous to come here at first since I saw some negative Yelp reviews ahead of time that mentioned mice, but thankfully I did not see any mice. My main gripe is that our waitress was a bit off-putting. She looked like she'd rather be literally anywhere else in the world. At one point, one of our candles under the fondue got extinguished and she gave us the most dead-eyed look when we asked her to reignite it. All in all, I would probably only come back to split the sharing fondue with friends on a special occasion.> Max Brenner is a cute restaurant that catches your eye when you walk by. It smells delicious and there are cute little chocolate-themed aspects about the restaurant itself.The food was average; fun to try once but not something I would crave. We ordered a cheese fondue trio (subbing out the Bleu cheese for an additional cheddar) that came with vegetables, bread, pretzel bites, etc. The cheddar beer cheeses were okay, nothing to rave about, and the spinach artichoke dip was essentially just hot spinach with a little cheese holding it together. The pretzel bites were dry af, but everything else was fine. We would have preferred to know what comes on the plate before we ordered so we could have subbed out the parsnips & celery for more bread.Service was mediocre at best. We didn't know our server's name (she never introduced herself) and we didn't get water refills. As two former service-industry workers, we were a bit disappointed.As for dessert, it's a chocolate themed restaurant so you would think this is where they shine! Unfortunately, the platter we ordered was just ""good"" (not great, not spectacular, and definitely not a must). We subbed out some of the dips for more fruit and I do have to say it was PLENTY for two people. We both left feeling stuffed to the gills.Overall, I probably wouldn't feel the need to come again. It's a bit pricey considering the quality of the food and the level of service. I prefer Melting Pot instead as my fondue restaurant of choice.> I came on a weekday evening for pre-valentines day dessert with my boyfriend. It was ridiculously crowded, which was not surprising given the holiday. We were seated at a tiny table with one of the chairs squished against another chair from a different table - not the most comfortable set up. We ordered the Spectacular Melting Chocolate S' Mores Sundae to share. I was really happy with how huge the sundae was when it came out! I loved the marshmallow and chocolate fudge combination. The sides of white chocolate and whipped cream were also nice to have! While I did enjoy the sundae, I didn't think it was worth the price at all. Our waitress was very kind and attentive. I had no service complaints. Overall, we had a good time, but probably won't be back for a while since the food is definitely overpriced in my opinion.","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Dishes are typically very unique, with an array of breads (momos, fried bread, and a thin bouncy bread) which soak up the flavorful sauces. A lot of healthy veggie-focused options too. Love to finish the meal with some hot chai. Really solid quality with distinctive flavors and the buffet makes it an unbelievable value. Attentive, friendly service but they give you your space too. A go-to place!> This is a really nice spot with a great lunch buffet with many vegetarian options of Tibetan food. I think it's a little over priced, if you compare it to Indian buffets (both have vegetarian and chicken options).Also, as someone who traveled in Tibet and the Tibetan villages in India, I missed the dumplings (momo)... maybe they could add those to their buffet too?> Oh myyyy god the lunch buffet is to die for. Great variety of hot food, salad-y greens and veggies, fruit, lentil soup, and hot tea. Didn't see any other dessert dishes though?Come early to get a spot for lunch. We arrived at 11:30 when it opened which was a fantastic idea. Let me repeat again: the food is amazing. Wish the buffet island was a little more accessible but oh well didn't really detract from the experience.I will say I came here another time a couple years ago where I ordered a meatball soup dish for dinner and was underwhelmed. But the lunch buffet is great!","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

Strong, tasty drinks. We always grab a drink here before dinner when we stay at the Lenox. Raw bar is surprisingly good and their homemade cocktail sauce is amazing! Pretzel trio app is also delicious!> Inside the Lenox HotelFirst, we walked in and there was only one little table available for us to sit at, but it was perfect for just the wifey and I. We looked around the bar while viewing the menu. The crowd seemed to be a bit more on the ""older"" side. Hey, I like the older folks too!! Mallory was our waitress and greeted us quickly. She was quite busy with serving tables and such, we thought she might have her hands too full. Mallory rocked it! I ordered a Blue Hill Mule which was damn delicious! Started off spicy.. but I'm not complaining. It was good! We ordered some ""chips"" on the menu and I thought they were amazing!! The sauce it came with was darn good too!!No complaints what-so-ever about City Bar. If I had any negative things, it would be that it was very dark but really didn't effect us one bit!> This place needs to replace their doormen.  I'm on a knee scooter due to a broken foot and the guy at the door stops me and says sorry you can't come in here with that and says I have to leave it at the door.  Ummm... I was speechless at first.  Then I responded ok, are you going to carry me to the bar since I can't walk?  He looks at me puzzled, then I say can I speak with a manager.  He flags down the mgr in the lobby and of course he says yes I can bring that in, no problem.  The rest of the experience was fine, but hopefully they'll use this review to replace the doorman working on February 15th around 12:30am.  Took me 2 drinks to calm down, maybe they do it purposely> I sauntered up to the bar, I was surprised when Maisie Williams' blonde sister turned around to greet me. A twinkle in her eye, and maybe murder in her heart, she took my order.I kept my eye peeled as she made my drink, carefully evaluating the chance of iocane powder being slipped in. I've built up a tolerance over the years but it can still make you gassy.The drink seemed legit, and she smiled at me. I squinted hard at the beverage and took a sip. All the power of the iron throne charged through my body, and my taste buds awakened for what I can only assume...the first real time.I no longer feared death. If this was the way it would end, then I fully embraced it.Thank you Miss Maisie Williams Blonde Sister, cheers to you and your beverage.Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe, as they say.> City Bar is a great hotel bar.  It is truly one of the best! Visitors are greeted by the scent of the Lenox hotel. It is very distinct and pleasant. After walking through the hotel lobby, the bar itself has romantic, dim lighting.  I especially enjoy the bar as it does not have a flatscreen television. Instead, there is a tasteful picture on the wall, overlooking the bar that changes colors.The decor is modern and elegant.  It is a cozy environment.  If you decide not to sit at the bar, there is a cushy couch or tables that align the walls.  There is a variety of great menu options.  My favorite is the pasta!  There is a made from scratch pasta option that changes each day of the week. I highly recommend this bar, whether you are a local resident or if you are staying at the Lenox hotel.","5, 5, 1, 5, 5"

THE UPSIDE DOWN PINEAPPLE CAKE WAS AMAAAAAAAZINNNGGG!> Great place for a drink after work, the bar gets busy on weekdays, but seating for dinner doesn't seem to be an issue which was good. We stopped in for drinks and apps so didn't try much in the way of a full meal, but the service was quick, friendly and attentive - no complaints there. The beer selection was pretty good, I liked the couple of seasonal options they had. The pretzels were hot and came with room temperature cheese and mustard - pretty standard, but good overall. The nachos were very crunchy but could have used more toppings. I think they layered everything because once we got to the bottom of the place all the cheese was on a just a few chips. Although we did get them with chicken on top and that was charred and juicy - makes me think that a full meal would be tasty here.Overall this is a great little spot to hang out for a while after work and grab a quick bite. I'd stop in again and try some of their actual meal items to see how those hold up.> I came in for takeout and waited at the bar with a beer (Sam Adams Summer Ale). The bar tender was very nice and quick. It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready.Pesto chicken sandwich: tasty and very fresh. I think it needs a little salt. Or something. Not sure.Steak and cheese: in a hoagie. Quite good!The fries were great.If I have the chance I'll definitely come back.> we were in Boston and had a nice lunch here.

This is a classic Boston hotel bar. Very classy, dimly lit, dark wood. If you drink whiskey, order the Irish  Rose. They prepare it tableside and there's a whole elaborate presentation and story to go along with it.  You have to see it. It's amazing! My friend got this drink and said it was delicious and smooth. Best $18 bucks spent-- for the drink and the presentation. Our server was lovely...very professional yet personable, you could see she loved her job, and she was super knowledgeable so if you needed a recommendation she could help pick the perfect drink for you (we were a party of 6 and everyone loved the drinks they got). Oh and the free bar snacks! House made tortilla chips and a mix of olives, pickled peppers, pickled onions. They were great. I would love to come back again and will plan to. A wonderful experience was had.> classy bar. dark and moody with a rich soul in its' bones. you can feel it. sat at the bar and ordered a couple rounds and a charcuterie. great service and strong drinks. highly recommend.> The servers here just seem to love their job. They are so pleasant and helpful, it makes you want to stay longer. Had a nice generous pour of wine. They let us do a small sample tasting to determine which chardonnay and cabernet we wanted in full glass. The little treats they bring to the table are a nice touch. Would go there even if didn't stay there.> Food and atmosphere was good but the service has something very much to be desired. After a night out, our group went for some appetizers and a night cap. The server was prompt but came across disingenuous. At one point he suggested he had 2 different Pappy Van Winkles I could have. With no one at our table drinking whiskey my only assumption is he was trying to take advantage of people he thought had no idea the cost, or was too intoxicated to decide. At the end of the night once our bill was split he switched around prices on our bills after signing. Weather it was on purpose or mistake he tried passing it of as ""taxes fluctuate"". Finally things were sorted out and we left. Still waiting to see if our card gets double charged.> We loved this bar! It's cozy and comfortable. If you're there, ask for Mary Ellen to serve you. She's amazing and so interesting, too. And she provided us with so much information on Boston and the wharf area.","5, 4, 5, 2, 5"

I ordered the ACQUA PAZZA which is basically a bunch of seafood in a tomato sauce. It's huge!  If you love seafood, this is perfect for you. Highly recommended spot!> Took 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. I finally flagged down a waiter who wasn't ours to help us get someone assigned to us. Finally when we got our waiter, my friend and me immediately put in our drink order and an order of their aranchinis for an app. They came out pretty speedy, but when I bit into the aranchini, it was still FROZEN in the middle. Like ice cold. The cheese wasn't even melted. We of course send it back. One of the managers brought out a new batch that were fine. My friend and I ordered drinks, an app, mains, and each got a dessert (we were celebrating!) and Nebo didn't even take off the $10 aranchinis. Just an awful experience for a restaurant that's in the heart of Boston. 2 stars because our mains were very good.> Ordered takeout from here. Three pizzas: two Traditionales (3.0/5.0) and one Margherita (3.0/5.0). Considering they were simple cheese pizzas, I didn't have unreal expectations. The crust and cheese were good, but not greatTo be honest I expected more, because we paid around 55 for three cheese pizzas. The ambiance seemed real nice but I don't know if I'll come back for another meal.Peace \/> Ohh Nebo Cucina had me indulging in more cocktails than I meant to but who can say no to a Bellini flight?The Bellini flight consisted of four different flavors (strawberry, raspberry, peach and mango) and each of them were delicious. Highly recommend it to share for $17. I also shared the Tagliatelle cappesante which had three delicious jumbo scallops on top of a bed of lemony creamy pasta. Then for dessert, I had one of their espresso cocktails which was delicious. Be prepared to drop some dough here for dinner. However if you are looking forward to a fancy Italian dinner, Nebo Cucina certainly did not disappoint in their food and drinks.> Gluten free HEAVEN in Boston. The food was delicious, great service, yummy drinks. My boyfriend took me here as a surprise, and when we walked in they asked if we needed a GF menu. The waiter asked about allergies. All around super knowledgeable - the most comfortable I've felt as Celiac in Boston. Scallop pasta was super good, recommended by our waiter. GF calamari was delish, too! All around wonderful experience. I'm already begging to go back.","5, 2, 3, 4, 5"

never tried this place before. It's on the same block with Bon Chon, pho Le, etc., The restaurant was empty so my husband and I were a little hesitated when we were seated. We ordered Szechuan fish fillet, beef with watercress, calamari, Jo Jo Taipei seafood hot and sour soup, and fried chicken. The food was actually really good except the fried chicken. Everything was well seasoned. My husband's favorite was the beef with watercress. Our waitress was very nice to us. The experience overall was good.> This Taiwanese spot definitely deserves more credit. They serve some great foods at affordable prices and are flavorful! The restaurant is big and has plenty of seating, also able to accommodate large parties. They have lunch special deals that are decent and are lunch sized portions. They also have other menu items that are great for serving parties that want to have a family style meal (which I recommend so that you get to try more dishes). The food comes out fairly quick and the staff is attentive.I enjoyed most of the dishes on their menu and definitely recommend the three cup chicken, a classic Taiwanese dish that you can't go wrong with. The salt and pepper calamari is also very good. I also enjoyed this diced chicken cooked with red pepper dish. They have ranges of spicy and non spicy dishes to satisfy both flavor palates. The lunch menu items are decent and have some good things on it but otherwise, it's very starchy and takes like a better version of Chinese take out. The bowls of rice are small but perfect portions to go with the meal.I also enjoy their appetizer items as well. The scallion pancake with beef is not bad. The scallion pancake is very thick and dense but has a good crusty outer layer. Since it's dense though, it doesn't have enough sauce inside to accommodate it.I haven't tried their shaved ice but I've heard great things about it.> My new favorite taiwanese place in Boston! Authentic taste, fast service, good ambiance, and reasonable prices. I love that their dishes are not overly oily! Would recommend this over some of the taiwanese places in chinatown. Came with a few friends on a weeknight and was seated right away at a big round table with a lazy susan. We ordered 6 dishes: pig ears: not very flavorful, mostly just the taste of sesame oil. 3/5three cup cuttlefish: very tender cuttlefish. the sauce was very good but a bit too sweet. although maybe the three cup chicken will be better. 4/5dry cooked chicken: pretty good! definitely recommend 5/5sautéed chinese melon: the melon tasted a little weird, like maybe some residual soap had not been washed off?? not sure... 3/5mushroom hot pot: I love mushrooms so I really liked this dish! There was a lot of mushrooms in there. 5/5taiwanese noodle soup (non-spicy): a bit too sweet for me but there were huge chunks of meat in there. we all really liked it! 5/5Overall a pretty authentic restaurant with a large menu. I will definitely be back.> If you are looking for authentic Taiwanese food, look away! This place is run by Chinese people - not a single Taiwanese employee when we went - and everything is too spicy. It is definitely Jo Jo Szechuan, so the fact that it advertises itself as Taipei is both dishonest and misleading.The pork lo mein was really good. Soup dumplings were okay but nothing to write home about. Minced pork rice was okay but lacking both meat and sauce - heavy on the rice. Despite the extensive menu options, everything else was terrible. We had them make the Dan Dan noodles less spicy, but they were still spicy. Ma po tofu always has pork in it, but Jo Jo's was vegetarian and overpriced. The salt and pepper chicken is an even worse buy than the ma po tofu! It looks like huge pieces in the picture because there are huge BONES in the chicken. Authentic salt and pepper chicken does not contain any bones. Once again restaurant being cheapos as it's 85% bone.> For me, the only plus side of coming here is that there is no wait. However, the food didn't taste very good and the service wasn't good despite the restaurant not being very busy, so I don't see myself coming back here.Pan fried dumplings - My friends and I felt like these tasted a bit off. One person thought it was too salty; I thought it was a bit sour. In any case, it didn't taste quite authentic or good.Stewed minced pork over rice with egg - This was probably the best dish out of what we had. I thought the minced pork could have had more flavor as it was a bit bland, but it was still pretty good.Lotus cake - I'm not usually a huge fan of lotus cake but this was pretty good. Again, might be a bit bland, but dip it in sauce and it's enjoyable.There were a couple other dishes that we ordered but none of the really stood out as delicious. Each one seemed to be either too bland or too extreme in some type of taste (usually salty or sour).As for service, it seems that the restaurant forgot a couple of our orders until we asked about them (we heard them shouting the order to the chefs after we mentioned them). Even though we ordered mostly appetizers, it took about 30 minutes for all the food to come out.","5, 4, 4, 1, 2"

It's this creamy tasting Chinese sucking candy with a fun cartoon on the wrapper.> *municipal parking lot available in the back*What I enjoy most about the menu here is that I'm not overwhelmed by a cluster of options. The noodles here range from $9-$13 which is great and their noodles, and soup, are absolutely delicious. The noodle is nice, tender and medium-sized thick, and their soup has tons of flavor, but isn't overpowering. The beef noodle in house made soup was so savory and satisfying; highly recommend you get this if it's your first time here! We also had the fried pig ear which was a nice compliment to our main meal. Customization is also a part of the experience since you can order an additional noodle portion, or any add-on toppings to your noodle entree. There's a NY location as well and I will be going there in the near future :)> What a surprise! My cousins were telling me the Yunnan Crossing Bridge story and it intrigued me to give this place a try. It's known for its authentic  Yunnan cuisine. There is a parking lot out back, which is always a plus in Boston. The interior is a traditional Chinese restaurant layout, very clean and has multiple tables. We started off with the classic Sliced Pork Ear and Spicy Beef Tripe in Chili Sauce. The portions were tiny for the price, however, it was super tasteful. The pig ear was cooked perfectly that there was still a good crunch. The beef tripe had great spices, I couldn't stop eating it. For the main, what I came here for, I ordered the Rice noodle soup in clay pot. In my opinion, my entree was better than all my friends'! It's rice noodle with braised pork and vegetables cooked in a clay pot. I feel like the clay pot helped keep the flavors within. Their special broth is extremely tasteful. You can always add toppings, including more noodles! It's a quaint place to go to for a quick meal. I will definitely be back!","5, 4, 4, 4, 4"

I don't know if I would consider it a Boston must see but after walking the city and craving a great standard sandwich this was paradise!They have sandwiches on the menu that sounded delicious but they are more than accommodating to customize it. We added milkshakes which were a little runny for my taste but were a treat none the less.The service is friendly, fast and you could tell he is a local who knows his patrons. While eating the mailman  and a regular (or I'm guessing) came in and it was as though old friends were catching up while grabbing food. Cool place!> Amazing and friendly customer service is a bonus to the great food and awesome prices. Definitely stop into this location!> I had been used to coming here for ice cream. While getting ice cream, I became accustomed to the amazing people working there. One week, my sister was away and he gave us an extra ice cream free of charge to take home for her.Today, I was quite hungry and decided to get a meal from here. Very worth it. For $10 I got the pasta, garlic bread, and a salad. When I got there he asked me if I had an umbrella to got home. Food was good, I'm definitely going to get it again.All said and done, $10 for a very filling meal to some of the nicest people is well worth it, I highly recommend going if you get the chance.> My boyfriend insisted that we come here for the green monster ice cream when I was in town, and I'm so glad we did! The portion size is huge so it's more than enough to share. It was also the most incredible mint ice cream I have ever had. The mint ice cream comes with cookies and cream and chocolate swirl. It's the perfect level of soft and such a great treat to bring to the park across the street! The customer service here is incredible, and they were so friendly to both of us. They also recognize my boyfriend so it was really nice to feel so welcomed in a new area. I went a second time and the cookie dough ice cream was so great as well!The cozy shop is located on a corner. If you're in the mood to sit there, there's seating available. However, it's not far from two huge parks with fountains that you can bring your ice cream to and enjoy the outdoors! :-)> I ate the pasta with roasted peppers, loved it. I found it perfect.Would come back again.","4, 5, 5, 5, 4"

Place has nice music, not too loud, very chill environment and ambiance.Boyfriend ordered the burger. He loved it. Things he had to say about this as he's eaten a LOT of burgers from all over the place: structural integrity was solid - it didn't fall apart as he was eating it, good patty and taste, didn't taste the sauce that much (supposed to be a miso mushroom sauce) but still good. He didn't even let me try a bite so i know he loved it :') fries he also liked, but the star was definitely the burger.I ordered the truffled gratin pizza - really good, but after a while, truffle can be overwhelming so keep that in mind if you have to eat it. It was still delicious though! Really good fluffy/chewy crust, crisp underside, good tasting cheese. At one point i dipped  part of the crust into my bf's garlic aioli sauce he got for his fries and that sauce was good too.  Couple things about service - waitress very nice and attentive, they gave us our own glass water bottle which we appreciate cuz we drink a lot of water and prefer self-serve, food came out quick like no more than 20 mins!! (we had spent 45 mins waiting for take out from another restaurant in the area for 2 things... That wasn't great), very solid prices compared to those in the area - i think price was on point with the quality of the food and very worth it. Overall, this is a place we'll be coming back to for future Boston trips. I'm already choosing what to eat for next time (corn & crab hushpuppies, ten spice wings, blue crab mac n cheese -- also i remembered the names of these dishes so you can tell how excited I am to have these one day) love it! Only bummer was we were so hungry we didn't take a photo of the food...> Came on my second trip for some pre-PAX dinner &  drinks with friends. We were late for our Resy, but a call-ahead assured us our table would await. Keith was very friendly and helpful. One member of the party has an intolerance to both wheat and rice -- if you know your gluten free, you know most of it uses rice flour -- and to our astonishment we learned that all the GF stuff was rice-free. The GF pizza was the best she ever had, and the rest of the party also enjoyed the crab hush puppies, the shrimp tempora, the aristocrat pizza (very sweet, arugula offsets nicely), and a meat pizza.This will be a regular stop for us every time we are in Boston!> Fun place to watch sports and enjoy a beer! Recommend if you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite and enjoy a good beer. Bartenders are pretty busy most the time, so it may take a second or two to grab their attention. Overall everyone is really low key and relaxed. Good atmosphere> We were back in town for a long weekend; had late checkout at the hotel and needed brunch! City Tap House fit the bill. Cool space - and it was really busy about 11:00 or so on a Saturday morning. The breakfast quesadilla did not disappoint! AwesomeFlavors of eggs, cheese, hash browns, onion, bacon all baked into one delicious tortilla. Definitely recommend this spot! Will come back the next time we are.> Love the outside patio (especially on a weirdly warm January day). It was pretty big and just separated enough from the sidewalk people with the little fence/greenery! Massive beer selection. I didn't eat anything but definitely drank my fill! Wicked nice bartenders and pretty fair/normal prices. The menu looked promising so maybe next time!!","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

They have lots of beer and wine options and we took advantage of those options, it felt like a good day for some beers and barely legal seafood. Our one friend wasn't a fan of lobster or oysters so he opted for his mother country's staple food, fish and chips, or as we refer to them lovingly as fries. The lobster rolls were rich in butter and lovely with each bite. Could have eaten a second one but one was enough. My friend enjoyed his fish and chips. Can you really mess up fish and chips? We also had some starter dishes and they were also good too.> Love me some Legal but this location was tremendously disappointing experience for lunch on a weekend. Ambience/atmosphere was fun. Great exterior and nice interior. They have a lovely Koi pond. The interior space has some awkward seatings arrangements but not the worst. Service was challenging. We had an eager waitress but she looked stressed, disappeared for long periods of time, was complaining about the cooking staff being backed up to us in person and then audibly stating everyone was screwing things up today. When we asked about why other tables got their food (and similar dishes!) much quicker while our party had to wait she looked panicked. One manager seemed to ask her the same and if she delivered to the wrong table. We respectfully expressed our hunger and frustrations thrice with her, and then with the manager who stopped by who apologized. Unfortunately no expedited replacement of our food, and the bill was without any reparations or compensation. It wasn't even a busy day! Very disappointing. The food was generally good though some dishes obviously had been sitting out a long time and not at the ideal temperature. The seafood tower was flavorful but a smaller portion that I was expecting and the menu conveyed, especially compared to other Legal experiences. The kid menu items were quite bland -- massive plates of pasta and fries and very little of the veg or fruit advertised. The fisherman's chowder main course was amazingly rich and filling despite the quaint appearance. Price was as you'd expect for Legal and decent quality for higher prices than some competitors. The tower should have been cheaper for the selection offered. Overall wouldn't visit this Legal location again and definitely recommend avoiding if you're bringing your kids due to wait times and awkward seating arrangements.> Came here to try the lobster roll and boy was it the best in Boston. My wife and I tried 5 different places from casual to fine dining and Legal Sea Foods topped our list for hot buttery lobster rolls.The red sangria was sweet and good and the Sam Adams Lager was nice and cold. The crab cake was moist and tasty as well as the citrusy flavored salad. My only wish would be that the fries were more crisp when plated with the lobster roll, but that was minor compared to the star lobster roll. Definitely worth a taste... Of the wicked good lahbsta> I used to come here as a college student, but back then I could only afford it on special occasions because it broke my bank.Now that I'm older and can afford it I can't say it has the same special appeal it used to have.  The clam chowder is still one of the best in town. If you like the commercial variety that is starchy and uses sea clams.  Good ""clammy-flavor"".  But Down East in Maine it's more sour-milk based, and they use little necks or small steamers.For old time's sake I ordered the Baked Scrod.  It's kind of like going into an Italian place and ordering spaghetti and meatballs.  If you can't get the basics done right, then I'm not coming back.  So the Baked Scrod just didn't seem fresh.  I believe the white fish of the day was cod.  Just mediocre, and the breading could have been more buttery and crunchy.  Sorry Legal Sea Foods, your stock went way down in my book.  I'd only come back for another bowl of the chowdah.> Stopped by for dinner after the aquarium and had a wonderful dinner before heading up north. I got 6 oysters and a lobster roll for lunch. The lobster roll said market price which is quite a nerve wracking thing to see on the menu. Ended up being $30 or so for the roll. The lobster was cooked in butter and served on a warm roll. It was definitely delicious but not the best lobster roll I've had, especially at that price. The oysters were delicious and served with a nice array of sauces. We also got the crab dip to split and it was served with some weird rice chip, which was odd but the dip was very good. Definitely enjoyed everything but certainly could have been better.","4, 2, 5, 5, 3"

I caught up with a friend here over a nice enough meal and split a great bottle of wine while listening to a jazz band kill it on stage. Can't ask for much more than that. If possible, ask for a table close to the show so that you can make the most of your visit to the Beehive. It wasn't a cheap night out, but well worth it if you consider that you're paying for dinner and a show. The space itself seemed well thought out from our vantage point near the stage.> Came here yesterday for a brunch with my guys.The service was good, everyone was very nice, attentive, and seemed like they wanted you to have a good time.The waiter was a bit forgetful and even though wee had a big group, wasn't using his notepad to take orders, which would have been helpful because he forgot a few things.For the food, it was ok - i had the short rib benedict and the skirt steak with eggs. The portions were decent but the flavor was mediocre in my opinion.The drinks are really good!!'The ambiance was nice and I appreciated the live Jazz.Probably a place to come for Jazz & drinks, but not for the food, honestly. Also really crowded so book a reservation!> Went to The Beehive for Saturday brunch and was glad that I did! Also, definitely make a reservation if you can. There was live jazz which was awesome and the dining rooms downstairs have a cool rustic meets slightly swanky vibe that reminds me of New Orleans. Definitely sit downstairs instead of the mezzanine up too. Service was pretty good and food came out in a timely manner.The Eggs Shakshuka was tasty but one of the poached eggs was overcooked so the yoke wasn't runny at all but the other egg was perfect. I added the merguez spiced lamb to it and it was flavorful and tender. Overall I would definitely order it again though it wasn't quite as filling as I'd hoped so you might want to add a side of something if you like a bigger brunch.The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was very flavorful. The salmon was delicious, the poached eggs were perfect, and the English muffins were really good. The plate comes with greens as a side, I'd probably get an order of frites with the meal next time. I'd say one of the Benedicts are what I'd order next time I go!The vibe is the true winner of this place! They have live jazz for weekend brunch and in the evenings on Fridays and the weekend I believe. There seems to be a shortage of nice jazz club/restaurants around Boston so I'm happy to have found this one! (Let me know if you know other good ones!)> Went here today with friends and have mixed feelings about this place. Here's the rundown,THE GOOD-huge restaurant with multiple rooms-the decor is outstanding, very unique and hip-the live band, they sounded really good-unique menu, and there's a hidden American Breakfast option with scrambled eggs, and baconTHE BAD-hostesses are too cool to be nice. Even with a reservation they hardly informed me of anything. They treated me with such disrespect. -poor service from kitchen staff, the breakfast I ordered was missing the cheddar cheese when the kitchen staff member brought it to the table. He said he would look into it, but I never heard back from him. -poor service from server, he was spilling coffee onto our table and not providing any apology, not cleaning it up, or providing extra napkins without asking, it was shocking.-prices here are pretty high, 3 coffees and 3 breakfast plates came to $70, before tip. It's too bad the service is bad from all the staff we encountered, as it's such a nice place inside.> Cute place for some Sunday brunch. The atmosphere is casual and fun with live music. I enjoyed a Bloody Mary to complement my eggs Benedict. They were cooked perfectly and not over the top with too much hollandaise sauce. Our waiter was kind and very attentive,  and the service - great! Next time you are in Boston, go to the South End and have a good meal!","5, 3, 4, 2, 5"

I loved that they had options for burnt ends which is my favorite! I got a combo plate of pork belly burnt ends and brisket. Both were sooooo tender and not dry at all! They have barbecue sauces at the tables which were fun to try! They have one sweet spicy one that hit the spot! Service was great! They were super attentive and hospitable. Went on a weeknight and was still busy even for a table for 2! I recommend making a reservation ahead of time> This was a new-to-me spot and it was fabulous! We came for lunch on Valentine's Day instead of Shake Shack and I'm glad we did!Of all the things we had, you NEED the Mac & Cheese bites. They were the highlight and the ranch you dip them in is insane.We each got the pit crew platter with two meats and two sides. The pork belly was good (not the best I've ever had but solid) as was the pulled pork. The brussel sprouts were  as were the mashed potatoes. We also enjoyed a couple cocktails. The classic old fashioned was a winner and perfect to pair with the BBQ.> I've been here twice, although I couldn't remember the first time when I returned last Friday night until I was about halfway through. In both instances, I do recall the place being packed and really loud. When my friend and I walked in, we walked past an empty table and headed to the bar to look for adjacent seating. As I noted earlier, it was packed and it wasn't clear anyone would be leaving soon so we stepped out and decided to try our luck at other places. We returned and were seated at the empty table we first saw when we realized the other possibilities were not. Unfortunately, we were seated near a large group, and one member had a particularly loud and annoying laugh.We decided to split the BBQ pulled chicken plate on the suggestion of the server after she heard we were going to order the pulled chicken sandwich and three sides. The plate, as its name suggested, did not come with bread, but came with two sides. We ended up trying the brussels sprouts, bacon collards, and scallion mashed potatoes. I don't think either of us liked the collards. Luckily, I wasn't hungry or maybe it was perfect. My friend said he was hungry but we ended up splitting the order so I don't think the portions are very big. He ordered a beer and the table next to us ordered several flights of whiskey. Additionally, the restaurant serves cocktails and wine. The restroom was clean although on the women's side they only had two stalls so it can be a bit of a wait on a busy night.> As far as I know I have now visted the 3 locations around Boston. This is how much I love this place. The food is always amazing and the staff is incredible. The cornbread here is 2nd best to Kendall Sq. Tho they had such a beautiful amount of butter on there.Now comes the part I don't like. Despite making a reservation and showing on time we were placed in the worst seating area possible. It was cramped and crowded. Noisy, terrible. I just asked if I could sit at the bar and so we did that.OH! and for as long as I've been drinking I have never had a sangria so good.While there we were greeted by Matthew who is incredible and fun. But he wasn't the only one and that was confusing. We had two ppl checking on us and serving us we weren't sure who to put what order too or if this person is coming in lieu of the other. If we had to reput in our order.The food was worth every star I could give but the experience was a bumby one.> Ok so I've actually been here twice without reviewing; this review will be based on my first visit. I came in as a party of 2 on a dead weeknight, was seated immediately. Our server seemed miserable but it became quickly clear it was due to an extremely needy and irritating party of 10 that he also had. I would've been miserable if I had them too. It didn't affect the quality of his service though. Everything was smooth and came out quickly. The lemon-limeade and peach sweet tea were both great. I'm a sides gal, so I got Mac and cheese, collards, and Brussels sprouts. My counterpart got smoked turkey, pit beans, burnt ends, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were the worst item, but they were still fine. The STAR of the show was not the meat, but the Brussels sprouts!!! I don't know who gave them permission to have such delicious sprouts (like what a random thing to steal the show) but they were INCREDIBLE. Everything else was super good too! Reasonable prices for sure. We got dessert, the banana pudding was incredibly lackluster, it didn't taste like bananas at all. Only thing I would not recommend. As I mentioned, I have already been back so I would clearly recommend coming here!","4, 5, 3, 3, 5"

There was a short line (the host said about 15 minutes), but the table was ready much faster. You could actually join the waitlist on Yelp, but the whole party needs to be there to get seated. We sat close to the kitchen. The restaurant has a cozy ambience with a lot of wood decoration (including the ceiling) and good service. We got two pizzas (pistachio and pesto, carmine). Both were delicious. The dough has this great chewy wheaty taste. Our favorite was the pistachio and pesto pizza. The pesto sauce is not heavy, and just the right amount of pistachio to enhance the crunchiness and flavor. The waitress offered us a small bottle of balsamic vinegar sauce (the condensed version you sometimes would see on pizza). I highly recommend asking for it/adding it to any pizza with white sauce. Overall it was a satisfying dining experience. If you're around north end and crave high quality Italian style pizza, this is the spot!> Spent a recent Saturday eating my way through Boston recently.  By the time my wife and I reached the North End we were not super hungry but looking for a small meal to share.  A quick search of Yelp led us here.  The two of us shared a warm ricotta appetizer that was mild but very creamy and satisfying.  We also split a small pizza ""Parma due"" which was topped with Gorgonzola, figs, prosciutto and arugula.  Despite the quality toppings, I must admit the crust was a highlight.... especially the outer crust which was crunchy on the outside yet almost fluffy on the inside. I could have used a bit more crispness in the center but overall this was a very strong offering. Definitely will be back.> We got lucky by getting a table for two here on Valentine's Day! We sat in the window at a high top that was very comfortable since we could lean against the wall. Service was good, very nice. We ordered the garlic toast which came with dipping sauce which was steaming hot! We also ordered the margarita pizza which was fantastic. Cooked in a brick oven grill and with fresh basil, sauce, and fresh cheese. Yum. Appreciated that they had parmesan cheese and pepper sprinkle on the table. Perfectly satisfying!> Good place in North End for an affordable personal size brick oven pizza. While the place isn't big, it doesn't get busy with tourists so there were plenty of open tables during lunch. I had a Margherita pizza to which I added prosciutto. I enjoyed both the pizza and the service at Locale. This is a nice option for a pizza if you want something nicer than a pizza by the slice shop but don't want to go to any of the fancy and/or tourist packed restaurants in the North End.> Located in Boston's Little Italy, this is a simple pizza place that really brings the full Italian essence to its pizza. I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my ""Parma Due"" pizza (prosciutto, arugula, figs and gorgonzola). It was the perfect combination that brought me back to my last vacation to Italy. I ended up finishing (to my personal horror and shame) the entire pizza all by myself, but it was worth every last bite. Delectable.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

The food taste was slightly above average, but still lower than my expectation. However, the skewers were still very nice and worth trying. As a newly opened Chinese BBQ place, I believe they can do better and hope they don't drop their quality.> I was pretty eager to try this place because Boston doesn't really have an authentic Chinese BBQ skewers place. After trying this place, it definitely beats my expectations of skewers quality and flavor. From a service perspective, there is room for improvement. In terms of skewers, my friend and I ordered beef, lamb, chicken, Mongolian special lamb, octopus, and grilled scallops. Everything is very good and the spice they put on really adds to the taste. Highly recommend the octopus and Mongolian lamb. The New Orleans chicken also has a special smoky bbq taste. To wrap up, we ordered a spicy hot noodle soup to finish out the night.What leaves much to be desired is the service. I ordered a draft beer that is half foam, service was slow, but understandable given they just revamped this place and started fresh. They also charged me extra accidentally. From a pricing stand point, we spend about 40 dollars each  which is slightly on the expensive side but hard to argue with where the location is. Overall, definitely worth a try if you are looking for some authentic chinesE skewers> This place was hyped up for its NYC locations before and I'm excited that this authentic and popular Chinese BBQ restaurant eventually found its way in Boston! Haggis Soup in Pot (羊杂汤）- highly recommend! Haggis is a savoury mix of lamb/sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs). Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavor! It's rarely seen here in US, let alone cook it as well as it here! It's a whole new level of northern Chinese food!Seafood Rice Noodle Soup was great, too! Full of flavors and beautiful in color! Very fulfilling with one bowl!All the skewers are great!I came here with my friends on its second soft opening day. The wait was bad :/ we were told to wait 20-30 min but turned out over 1 hour, which was not pleasant. Waiters are very nice and friendly but not quite attentive. They kept apologizing for inefficient operation of the restaurant but I'd rather receiving fast service than apologies. I believe it will get better with a little effort though! Will come back!> Overpriced... the seafood boil for 2 is not spicy... not mala flavor just herbs. The seafood is not fresh at all... the grilled scallops and oyster is $5.99 each... kind of over grilled for the oyster and the scallop was small since they sliced it. The seafood rice noodle pot was okay but nothing special. Service is okay and kind of busy during lunch on Friday even the business is weak due to coronavirus but it is better than I thought. But I wouldn't come back again. The food doesn't worth the price.> This place is average. My friend suggested we check out this place, and we were excited to try this place out. We ordered the enoki mushroom pot and combo of small beef, lamb, and pork...and I could say they were SMALL.  We realized that we should have just ordered individually skewers, which we tried the Mongolian beef that had 4 pieces on one skewer.  I would recommend the Mongolian beef skewer. The service was slow, and the owner seemed to be the only one that would check in on us. Before we got our last skewer, one of the waiters gave us our bill. We might come back to try more skewers and hope the service would be better.","4, 4, 4, 1, 3"

I don't really eat a lot of cajun places here in MA, but I would come back. I don't really think it would be my go-to, but for the Allston-Brighton area, I'd say I would probably steer myself towards Holly Crab than anywhere else.So, I only got the Holly Crab flavor. My boyfriend and I got two bags. One of Spicy and another of Medium. First bite, I wasn't convinced that I liked this place as much as Cap't Loui (I go to the one in Stoneham), but the more I ate it, the more the flavor got better. The only thing is, I don't think there was much of a difference between the Spicy and the Medium.Fresh crawfish obviously wasn't in season since it was winter time but it was still good and meaty. Snow crab legs were also full of meat and could really soak up the Holly Crab flavor. Snow crab is also my boyfriend's favorite. My boyfriend liked the shrimp (I can't really say much since I'm not too much of a shrimp eater). It's a solid place to go to, but I can't really say I'm in love with it? But I'm also not saying I hate it.Service was ok when wait staff would come around, but they don't really come around much. It's kind of just a hi and bye.> Been a loyal customer for 3 years and have seen it go down hill ever since the renovation. Sauce is no longer chunky and full of flavor, now it's watered down. Shrimp used to be fresh but definitely taste frozen now. We ordered fried oysters and chicken wings tonight and were blown away(in a negative way). Oysters were definitely frozen and were EXTREMELY fishy. When we ordered the chicken wings they told us it would be 25 minutes. After looking at the restaurant we realized all the tables already had their entree's so where's he wait time from? Holly Crab Sauce was lacking significant flavor. Not sure what changed from before the renovation but flavor and quality have continued to go downhill ever since.Lastly, it's November 10th and your server said that Sam Adams Summer was the Sam Seasonal option haha. We've already past Summer, October Fest, and are now onto Winter. Does that mean the Winter will be available in May 2020?> The recent visit disappointed me. I always visited this place for its seafood, but the last order from them was not fresh at all. Disgusted taste with powdery meat showed the shrimps were not properly stored or just not fresh.Then the mussels were extremely fishy and contains lots of sands(some hard crystal stuff). The sauce only had a spicy taste, then nothing. I am upset. I will look for a new place which cook seafood with the same style.> If you're from California and craving some ""boiling crab""-like seafood, this is the place for you! I would definitely go here for a pound of shrimp with all the flavors + medium-spice level, a bowl of rice, and corn on the cob. The flavoring is not as good as Boiling Crab, but it comes close -- enjoy!> I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food. The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good. As for some additional foods:- Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin.- Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice. Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty.","4, 2, 2, 4, 4"

Had I known I would have told them well, well, well done. They didn't even ask how I wanted my burger. I think they should ask and not just serve the raw hamburgers to everyone. I'll probably give them another chance - the menu looks interesting, but right now, I'm good with Five Guys.I did buy the chili and will update if the chili is AWESOME!Updating: the chili WAS AWESOME!!! I'll email you... thank you for paying attention to lil ole' me and my comments.> I come here often during my lunch breaks. I love getting their crispy haddock sandwich. Some of the items on the menu have been hit or miss for me. The employees there are super friendly but they have tendency to get my order wrong whenever I order through their mobile app which is disappointing. Luckily I work around the corner so I can just come in if there is a mistake but definitely should improve on getting orders correct. I have never sat down to eat here because it's always busy during the times I have come but if you like burgers then wahlburgers has a good selection of good burgers. They are pretty expensive so I wouldn't come here all the time. Burger will cost you anywhere from 8-$13. They have a good selection of salads if you are vegetarian and they just recently introduced the ""Impossible Burger"" to their menu that is worth trying out.> Don't waste your money! Just Spent $50 on lunch- curbside pick up , the staff forgot to put any plastic forks or spoons , essential for Mac n cheese.  Their phone rang out and I had to walk back in where the staff stood about and I requested plastic forks and napkins- burgers were disgusting and fries were not much better.

The clam chowder was very good. I have had better lobster rolls...although big portion, flavorless...no drawn butter nor mayonnaise ... I should have gotten a bowl (not a cup) of chowder and a half dozen oysters..My wife had the scallops and daughter got the fish a chips. Both excellent. Corn bread served instead of bread.A little pricey, but you are paying for the ambiance. If this is you first trip to Boston and the Freedom Trail, this should be on your bucket list> Advertised as the oldest restaurant in America. My travel group and I tried this place. It certainly was old. Warning this place is not ADA compliant. No ramp, tons of staid and steps and the bathroom stalls at least for the ladies were so tiny. I'm a small girl and both of my shoulders nearly touched either side of the stall walls. You walk in and there is an actual oyster bar to the left. There was more seating upstairs. And then through about her room and then through yet another room. Wonder how many hidden hide away rooms there were. This place is also famous because it was Kennedy's favorite spot. They even have a booth on the second floor dedicated to him as the ""Kennedy Booth"". This apparently was his table he always sat at. Ordered oysters. Which were great!  The mixed drink was not so great. My main was a stuffed lobster. It took an eon to arrive and also not so great. It was just full of breading with not so much lobster. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a quality dining experience. However if you're doing the self guided freedom trail tour this stop is on the way. I'd recommend to make a quick stop at the oyster bar and have a few oysters and walk upstairs to check out the Kennedy booth.> America's oldest restaurant seems to live off it's reputation rather than its quality. While the overall experience was cool (the Kennedy's sat over there!), I can't recommend the food. It was overly buttered and salted for my taste, and didn't provide much in the way of flavour. Before you decide to go, you should realize that you're really going to a museum that happens to serve food. If visiting places with history is up your alley, head to the Oyster House, if not, stay away. The one dish of note were the raw clams that they had on offer. I've never had raw clams before, and I can't say that I'll be having them again. While I didn't hate it, I'm not sure that I'll be a future fan of ""like raw chicken from the sea"", as one of my friends described it. Not the best description, but very apt. While I didn't mind it, I'm not sure why people would really enjoy it> The first time I ate here, I dined at the half moon oyster bar downstairs and spent $40 on a plate of so-so oysters. This time, I returned and we decided to eat upstairs in the restaurant part. Know that there are 3 rooms set throughout the restaurant ... bottom floor is bright, upper portion is the old part and the most historic/dark and upper side room is brighter with windows but not at all historic.This is mainly a tourist restaurant these days which serves average to below average seafood churned out to the masses. My suggestion is to ask at check-in if you can be seated in the oldest dining room, if you want the whole historic experience though it does feel a bit dark and dingy. Ask for The Kennedy booth, if it's available which is the big booth near the bar in the back. It is supposedly where JFK sat who was a regular ... although when I was a kid, I do remember a booth downstairs to the left of the oyster bar as having a plaque/photo and dedication, so who knows. Often restaurants designate the worst tables as 'histpric' so people don't complain about them and the 'Kennedy booth' is right next to a busy service bar.The food here ... the clam chowder we got was loaded with flour and/or corn starch which is used to thicken it. It was a thick paste and had little to no clams or flavor. At $7 PER CUP!!! obviously this is a signature dish which they know they can charge a lot for but it was a piss poor effort and I wouldn't order again. It was also served barely warm. If charging $7 for a small cup of soup it better be good ... and this wasn't.The fish of the day was a Sole, which I ordered broiled. It came as a thick piece of fish ... it looked nothing like sole. I believe they brought me haddock by mistake. No way was this sole. It was covered in a thick coating of burned tasting breadcrumbs and paprika. It was rubbery and had a strange and offputting taste ... hard to put my finger on but maybe it was the loads of paprika? I'd never order this again.Other had fried scallops and clams, which were fine ... maybe a slight taste of old oil which needed to be changed ... but it's hard to mess up fried seafood. The lobster roll was also fine ... maybe a little over dressed and the portion size was smaller than expected for the price. Mostly smaller pieces of claw meet with little tail. For the price, there are better lobster rolls in town. All meals come with cornbread which tastes made from a mix but is sort of nice. The Boston Baked Beans are $6.50 on their own as a side ... not worth it but your waitress may substitute them for french fries as your side for free if you ask. The cole slaw is nasty.I give 4 stars for the atmosphere and because it is such a 'Bostonian' experience that usually people from out of town will be happy if you bring them here purely from a historic atmosphere experience that they'll overlook the mediocre food at high prices. My favorite seafood restaurant in the city is the Atlantic Fish Company near Newbury Street and The Boston Common. If you are looking for good seafood in a classy atmosphere, you'd do better here. If you are looking for a historic experience in a famous restaurant and don't mind average food, you'll be fine at The Union Oyster House.> Had such an epic meal at Union Oyster House on Saturday night with a bunch of friends from all over the place. Sure, this place can be a bit touristy but who cares, it's an institution. The best part of the evening was our server (Stephanie I believe) who had the best Boston accent I'd ever heard. She worked hard and was a true pleasure to have that evening. I ordered the little neck clams and we shared some oysters which were all fabulous. East coast clams are second to none and so damn delicious. I also had a little cup of chowder alongside the cornbread and it was way better than I expected. For my main I had the boiled lobster (medium) because the 1.25/1.5 pound lobsters taste the best to me. Boo ya. Make sure to at least hit the semi circled oyster bar in the front of the restaurant while visiting Boston, it's a great experience.","4, 2, 3, 3, 3"

Look no further!  I've tried oyster po boys here, lobster rolls, clam chowder, lobster bisque, and fresh raw oysters. Their best item is the oyster po boy. From the flavorful breading on the oysters to the sauce, and the perfectly buttery bun, everything about it was perfect! Their lobster bisque was my second favorite thing there. It is a must try. I went to Quincy Market after the first time coming here, and Red's Best Seafood is still 100% better than anything that I got there.The second time that we went (we had to come here for our last meal in Boston because the first one was so phenomenal), we got super lucky and got $1 oysters. The oysters were $2.25 per piece the first time we went. Their lobster rolls are the most perfectly executed that I had in Boston. The bun was perfectly buttery. The lobster roll had tiny pieces of celery and parsley on it. Every bite had a lot of lobster inside.There was never a line here when we went. There are seats around the stand. You order on one side of the store and pick up your food at the other end. There are boards saying where each their items are from. There's even a little map by the waiting area to show you the process of how they get their fresh seafood.There is a ton of stuff we didn't get a chance to try here yet, but I definitely recommend trying Red's Best if you're in Boston!> I had one free (freezing) day in Boston, and walked into the Boston Public Market for some warmth. The selection of foods/treats is impressive, but I decided that while in Boston, I had to go for some seafood. Red's Best Seafood is situated in the back of the market, with an extensive display of fresh, locally sourced seafood. I opted for a cup (5$) of clam chowder and the fish sandwich. Clam chowder: pretty decent, as far as clam chowder goes. Salty, thick, and steaming hot with decent chunks of clam throughout. There were a few underdone potato chunks scattered in my portion, but nothing offensive. I have to say, I may just not be a fan of chowder myself. Fish sandwich: man this was good. The fish was undoubtedly fresh, battered and deep fried. Served on a soft bun with lettuce, tomato, and some kind of yummy sauce. It was a generous portion of fish with a thick crispy batter. I wish I would have gotten this with a serving of fries in lieu of the chowder. (They had lobster poutine today, I definitely missed out!)Over all, decent price for delicious food. I would definitely recommend this to any friend visiting in Boston.> So I really must say this was a killer lobster roll,This location is a must see ,Really nice place to just seat down and eat in a market not a restaurant,But you can see the lobster and many fresh fish,They even tell you what boat brought them the fish.Friendly staff.> Came in to get some lunch and get my parking ticket validated from some errands I had to run at city hall, I got the $9 fish sandwich and honestly wasn't expecting much. I waited only like 10 mins and then was given this beautiful hot crunchy amazing fish sandwich that tasted light and fresh! Honestly shocked and amazed about the price and quality of this place. Definitely turned into a happy accident and I definitely will be back to try the rest of this delicious looking menu! Thanks you for the pleasant surprise and great customer service! I will be back with friends :)> Red's Best Seafood is a seafood vendor inside of the Boston Public Market on 100 Hanover Street, a block over from Haymarket Station. In addition to the fresh seafoods sourced from the famous seaports that you can purchase by the pound, you can also order up hot items such as seafood (fish or scallop) tacos, buttered lobster rolls, crab cakes, fish and chips, fried oysters, fried scallops, and other items. The soups that you can order are the clam chowder and the lobster bisque. You can order freshly shucked oysters and clams in addition to steamed lobster. Instead of the lobster roll, I prefer the lobster over kale. This is a prepared item that you can grab and go rather in the refrigerated section. There is also sliced salmon and sliced tuna salad. When I head over to the Boston Public Market for lunch, I tend to go for the sushi and the poke bowls. My favorite roll is the crunchy salmon roll with crispy salmon skin on top. My next favorite is the spicy salmon. The spicy tuna had to be the spiciest spicy tuna maki I have ever tried. The fiery red color is no joke. Not the prettiest rolls but the fish is always fresh and tasty. My favorite poke bowl is the crab meat poke bowl. This bowl has plenty of crab meat with a spicy mayonnaise dressing. There is a small amount of cucumbers and thin slices of avocados as well. I haven't tried the other poke bowls since the portion  are small for the price. I feel like there isn't enough protein (fish) to justify the price. Which makes me always go for the spicy crab bowl. Overall, this place has great quality sushi that you shouldn't skip over. Red's Best also uses real wasabi and not the powder tube wasabi. And if you have had the real stuff, it's actually much more pleasant than the powder variety and not as spicy. See my pictures.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

Their food and drinks are delicious!!! I love everything on their menu.The architecture is definitely high end, it's an amazing restaurant for a date or a special occasion.  I always recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family!!! If you are in the area definitely give them a try!> I've been to the Somerville location a couple times and enjoyed it, so I was excited to try the South End location with my coworkers. Boy were we all veryy disappointed. First of all, they didn't have any normal bourbon or whiskey at the bar- only sweet flavored whiskey. And no normal vodka or Tito's- only infused vodka. So if you're looking to drink anything other than wine or beer don't go here. 2) the food wasn't as good as the other location. We got the tator tots special that came with some kind of Korean sauce on top. In my opinion it didn't go well together and just plain tots would have been better. Then we tried two pizzas. One was the potato head pizza and the other the Brie and Apple pizza. The Brie and Apple pizza was so sweet that I didn't want more than a few bites. The potato pizza we were all super excited about, but was disappointed that the potato's were chips- was excepting more of a soft potato. Also the sauce  tasted like ketchup. And the dough less than mediocre Very confused on how two locations can have totally different experiences.Also we made reservations. When we got there it was pretty empty but the hostess still sat us all the way in the back by the bathrooms at the worst table. We asked to move since there was other tables open. So strange> Great food. Very good service!  Great selections of beers and ciders.  Close to northeastern so we go  often when visited hi2/2/20.  Just had brunch.  Out of this world.  Amazing!!!! Everything is so good!!!  Best egg sandwich on thyme  basic!!!  Never had  better. You mUst go!!!> I stopped in for dinner with some friends. Although this was my first time going to the South End location, I've been to the Somerville restaurant a few times. I started off with ordering a beer on draft. Their selection is pretty extensive, and I ended up getting a Fiddlehead. I was very disappointed to find my pint glass only 60% full. Did they spill half of it on the way over or drink it? I wanted to mix it up and got a veggie burger. The tomato marmalade made this veggie burger a must-try. I ordered the greens as my one side, but it was all wilted and brown lettuce. Gross. The server was super friendly, but not very fast. Our drinks were frequently empty for more than 10 minutes at a time (not helped by the skimpy pours). Overall, one star for the extensive beer menu and two stars for the delicious veggie burger. Without the burger, this would've been a one-star experience... that is not on par with how the  Somerville location operates.> Sweet name and even better food!  Running off of fumes and a terrible hangover, my friends and I stopped in for brunch.  I got a mimosa and a red sangria -  both were delicious but the sangria gives you more bang for the buck.  It was very unique - kind of like a cold apple pie in a glass (yes very diff yet delicious flavor!) with heavy notes of cinnamon that landed perfectly -- so much so In fact that after one taste, the whole table followed suit and ordered one!For my meal I got the fried chicken salad w a side of potatoes.  Though it would be basic but somehow managed to rock my world!  The chicken was crispy yet light and extremely flavorful. The picked onions paired perfectly and the sauce on it was minimal but managed to add the best tangy punch.  The hash browns were mediocre but gave me the starch I needed for another day of holiday drinking.

Came around lunch time on a Saturday and found it to not be crowded at all, with very short lines. Ended up trying a lot sandwich from Mamalehs. The only thing is that overall the food here is very expensive... but I mean, Boston.Got the bagel lox on an everything bagel. So good. The capers were kind of overwhelming so I didn't eat them.> The prices simply do not match the quality of food.The pizza from Monti was honesty some of the worst pizza I've had. You'd be better off going to dominos.The soup from Mrs Clucks was just okay. You can go down the road to Hojoku and pay the same price for their amazing Funky Chicken Ramen.Union Square Donuts are 5/5 stars.> Gets a lot of press from places like eater.com and such. But just conceptually doesn't match reality. You can easily blow through your savings and not get full, or not get a great meal. And likely that dough is paying for some overpriced rent some bigshot developer is making a killing on. The space is laid out rather cavernously - rows upon rows of tables and chairs, all lined out in a super organized fashion (as a buddy puts it, like a mess hall in a military barracks).I've reviewed the individual establishments in other entries, but I'll summarize by saying that I wasn't impressed with many of the dishes I had. Usually too salty, too fried with portions lacking or too small.> The amount of food options available makes time out market so enticing- I usually just find myself wandering thinking of what I want to eat. I think there's something for everyone here. It's also noticeable how high the prices are. I don't really mind paying a lot for something amazing. But I don't want to pay a lot for something that's just ok. Sadly I've found some items here have been just ok, which is a bummer. Tables get really crowded but there's some outdoor seating.> Super cool concept, cooler if you have a large wallet. The most wallet friendly restaurant has to be Mamaleh's. They havE really good bagel sanwidches, but the best in my opinion is the Leo sandwich served on  toasted challah breadd! It has caramelized onions, eggs and lox and dill mayo, super tasty and satisfying. Ms clucks' soup and dumplings is highly overrated, as the dumplings are overcooked and the soup  super bland. Make sure you grab At least two portions of chili sauce if you want some flavour. Gelato and chill is not bad, but you can definitely find better at MUCH BETTER prices. They do however have some interesting flavors worth trying (eg plum)","4, 3, 2, 3, 4"

I usually go with the sausage garlic cheese unless I'm hungrier, I'll get ""The Works"" which is my favorite. If you don't like anchovies just make sure you ask for none. This is easily top 3 pizzas I've had in Boston.> The food? Great. Awesome tasting pizza. I ordered a half shrimp scampi / italian sausage pizza and two skewers - lamb and steak tips. The shrimp scampi literally tasted like pasta. It was absolutely delectable. We ordered the skewers initially and were served with one huge skewer and half a loaf of bread. Super filling! Service? One does not come here to be wined and dined. The reason I give this place three-stars is for the food. It's the only redeeming quality. I'm not sure if we had come on a bad day or what but the woman who served us at the bar was borderline rude. She may have been the owner who knows. I even witnessed a server sneeze on a pizza he was about to serve. Now I get that this place is a local joint and probably has a cult following but c'mon, get with the times. I'm a lover of hole in the wall places, but the lack of service or welcome-ness left a bad taste in my mouth.> If you want a real Boston pie with that true Boston feel, Santarpio's is the place. It's legendary and you'll see why the moment your pizza hits the table. Or, you can order take out and wait in the kitchen while it's made. This is the real deal. Heck-it's even worth being late for a flight for when you're on the way to the airport! The only thing more Boston is Bobby Orr himself! Dig in!> This is very much a local's place, and I am not a local, with that said - it is definitely a place you should go if you want a taste of authentic old school East Boston Italian. You don't get places like this very often in the world today, so you have to treasure them. Very welcoming, very casual. I had the steak tips with the hot peppers, could've gone with the pizza and been very happy. This place is been here since the early 1900s, and hopefully for a long time going forward","5, 5, 3, 5, 5"

The place did not disappoint. Great breakfast sandwich, I appreciated the ability to replace bacon with a spicy guac and no upcharge (quickly checks receipt to make sure I'm telling the truth!). The focaccia was soft and everything else pulled together nicely. I had to have the famous sticky buns and they did not disappoint. They were not overly sticky, which my teeth and my dental hygienist appreciate. Ironically enough, I skipped my dental cleaning today, double win!!To top it off, staff was super nice, I asked newbie questions and didn't receive a hint of attitude. Will be back here, maybe later today!> I went back to Flour in the Back Bay and the sandwiches I bought were excellent as usual. I also bought the recently published Flour baking and savory recipe cook book for my Dad for Xmass and he loved it ! I had the tuna on Focaccia and really like the rustic  "" tapenade "" they added, but it seemed like a few crushed marinated green olives. High quality olives, which was nice. I just feel it would be better to have a layer of tapenade on the bottom. The hummus with pickled vegetables was good, great hummus and scallion foccacia, but I'm not a huge fan of pickled daikon. Next time I'll request that they omit it. Pickled red peppers were amazing. The few pickled red onions were a nice addition. I'd do pickled garlic, tomato, and shallot too, but that's just me - maybe some pickled persian cucumbers.  I also think, and please no offense meant, that black fermented garlic would be pretty stellar on this. I've had black garlic from food  purveyor or Sid rep, and it was really, really good. I think it's fermented but I'm not sure, and although the rep was pretty rude to me otherwise after swanning into our commissary  and making fun of me ( I was was using a really cheap Knife really quickly on a steel prep table surface because my fucking feet hurt too much to go get a board, and evidentally he found the site of me sprinkling a pizza with shredded "" mozarella "" directly on the prep table pretty objectionable. ) Was it the fact that it was Syco "" cheese "" that he didn't like ?!Always nice to know a food rep will come in an critique your performance although apparently he no longer cooks professionally ! I suppose he wanted us to buy the top shelf cheese he had. The sneering was going to make the sale in his mind. Like shooting fish in barrel, amirite ?!> I'm team Flour all the way. I always find everything so wonderfully imaginatively delicious and creative. When I come to town lately, I tend to stop by this location as it is close to the airport and my friend's office. Luckily, he obliges me when I say I prefer Flour over Sweetgreen. Since I hadn't done vegetarian all week, I opted for the grilled cauliflower melt. My friend tried the chicken and broccoli-rabe panini. We split the tophat cupcake which I had been eyeing for weeks. We were both surprised at the texture of the frosting. It was light and creamy and lovely with crushed peppermint candies on top. The cake itself was very moist but too crumbly. Seating can be tough and it seems to be the case no matter when we go. It's always as we leave, things seem to die down and there is more space.> Ordered a Boston Cream Pie since many Yelpers raved about it. It tasted like tiramisu. Someone didn't clean the bowl! Texture was good. I thoroughly enjoyed the chewy ganache. However, if I wanted tiramisu I would have ordered that. For $6 I was disappointed with the quality. Service was nice. They don't rush.

I had a craving for scallion pancakes when we paid for our bill so I ordered some to go - the waitstaff was extremely respectful and sweet throughout the dinner, but they were not close to the best scallion pancakes I've had before.> Just had lunch here, the food was good. We had the chicken satay, pad see ew of roasted pork, and massaman curry. The place smells a bit funky but I guess it's that typical smell.... the place could be updated since it felt a bit old. The food was good. Our favorite was the roast pork pad see ew.> I'm not a stranger to King and I, been there many times before - last time I ordered for a pick up, was told 30 minutes, ended up waiting there for an hour plus alongside three other people waiting for a pick-up. Yes, it was lunch time, but there were tables available so they weren't super busy. Yes, I ordered a few dishes (maybe 8 or so-for coworkers) and we were all disappointed that they 1) told us they needed more advance notice for a delivery but we could pick-up and then 2) we needed to wait twice as long as they said for a pick-up. The food was normal, I had the Drunken Chicken and it was tasty, so no complaints about the food, really.> The place is nice and quiet. Although their thai food is very good to taste, there are some improvements that can make the food taste delicious. Food: I loved their peanut sauce along with veggie fresh rolls. The Thai broccoli is delicious. The blend of spices in Basil fried rice is very well. However, the tofu was slightly over fried. The pineapple fried rice lacked the right blend of spices. The panang curry was mouth watering, but they could try a provide more curry to go with the rice. If you plan to order any of the above, then perhaps you can ask let them know before hand. Overall the food and service is very good. I would give the extra 1 star for the service. Alcohol: They have a good collection of wine and some nice local Thailand beers.> A great Thai restaurant. I had the massaman chicken curry which is my go to Thai meal which was very good. The coconut shrimp as an appetizer was a little average. But all in all our meals were good","5, 4, 3, 4, 4"

Given the popularity of this place (likely only increased by this accolade), I wasn't able to book a reservation and resorted to looking at other options. I was delighted to learn later, this is owned by the same person. The waitress guided us through the menu, pointing us to the star items. We were happy that we made some modifications based on her recommendations, as our meal was delicious. We ordered both the carbinera  and the seafood pasta and split them. The taste of both grows on you throughout the meal--then they are addicting and it's hard to stop eating. The bread was warm and exceptionally tasty. This is always a problem for me because I want to fill myself up on it before the meal comes. We selected a full-bodied bottle of wine that was $35. This was my favorite wine I'd had in a while. Great value--I would pay near twice that to purchase it at a winery. I love the added details in the decor. The washrooms have WWF wrestlers on the doors :) Excellent service. We were attended to through out the night--never had an empty glass of water or wine glass. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening looking out the window into the raining Tuesday evening.> Food yes. Staff, namely bartender Stacy and the woman who gave me a dirty look when I was attempting to move through the restaurant. I understand people have rough nights or have personal issues but this woman made 0 effort for me to feel welcome and everyone around me. She made faces, was rude, not very attentive, and clearly did not want to be there. Luckily, again, I'm a tourist so I don't have to come back nor would I recommend if you're looking for a relaxing welcoming bar atmosphere.> If you're starving and looking for reasonably priced pasta in the North End, you've come to the right spot. This place caught my interest as the sister restaurant to Carmelina's, so I'd been looking forward to checking it out. We left extremely full and still had boxes of leftovers.The restaurant lacks a certain ambiance, there are big bar TVs and tiny tables with plastic plates. It was a little tight sitting at the table for two. Not really great for a romantic date, but better for casual or group dinners. Our waitress was very friendly and gave several useful recommendations.And now for the food! The restaurant has a southern Italian cooking style. We got the fried caprese appetizer, which had a really unique combination of flavors. The mozzarella and tomatoes were both fried, served with a pesto that may have had a hint of mint in it, as well as pickled vegetables. Overall - super tasty. I ordered the crazy alfredo pasta per the waitress's recommendation, which was also a nice surprise with a spicer cheese sauce -- definitely had a nice kick to it. There was sausage, chicken and red peppers in the dish, which you can see in the pictures is a huge portion that comes out in an entire pan like all the pastas. We also ordered the bolognese, which tasted like it may have been cooked in some wine sauce -- also delicious and a huge portion. Overall I was impressed with the food quantity and quality, especially for the price.> I was in Boston for a work trip, staying in the Seaport area and my sister and I were looking for a place to dine that evening. Originally from the Boston area, one of our favorite places to eat is the north end a.k.a. Little Italy. There's a lot of restaurants that she and I have already dined that and we wanted a new experience. I checked in with Yelp to see what was one of the top rated restaurants that you were able to make reservations with. A lot of the restaurants in the North End are small and don't take reservations. To my surprise and extreme luck, Domenic's did take reservations and had a spot available for us that evening. I booked our reservation a few weeks prior, to ensure we were able to get the time we wanted. We had both worked all day and we were famished. It was a Saturday evening, and we were looking to really mow down on some authentic, Italian food. It was our cheat night. Also, being of Italian descent, pasta is something we get a little serious about. Upon arrival, we told the hostess we had a reservation and we did not have to wait at all. I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't as busy as expected. We got a beautiful, two-seater right by the window so we could people watch and taking the streets of Little Italy in Boston. We were approached almost right away by our incredible server, Alexandra. She was great and helped us navigate through all of the incredible options that they offered. They do have their liquor license but their vodka is flavored, although they do have the Skinny Girl vodka. I took this as an opportunity to order something different. While my sister started with a cosmopolitan and then ended on champagne, I ordered two Negroni's made with vodka, Campari, and soda water drinks. They were served with sphere shaped ice in a bourbon glass. My first cocktail was less than halfway full, my second cocktail was nearly all the way full when served. I guess they started really liking us :-). We ordered a few appetizers, and decided to split our meal. There is so much great food items to choose from. We also took advice from our wonderful server, Alexandra. There was another girl who came over as the restaurant started getting busy, and I'm so sad that I didn't get her name. She came over and gave us a lot of great advice on the menu as well. We ended up ordering the Cabonara pasta dish that she recommended and it was, no exaggeration, the best pasta I've ever tasted in my life. Definitely filling and I would recommend sharing. She explained that carbonara is supposed to be made by cracking an egg, and that should add to the base of the sauce, not by using a cream sauce. She also gave us a name of a place that we could get incredible desserts from Everett. She said ""ask for Tony."" We haven't been there yet but I always like to take a recommendation.The bread was absolutely delicious and the complimentary olive oil and balsamic was incredible. Alexandra told us we could get the same kind from Monica's down the street. Right after we left, we picked up the olive oil and I now use it for everything. Cooking, salads, etc. We decided to split the house salad, the steak with a side of charred broccoli rapini, and the carbonara pasta dish. It was the perfect order. We thought long and hard about it because we wanted to get a mixture of everything. The steak was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly, the rapini was a perfect accent mixed with the potatoes was pure heaven. I can't say enough about this place. I love the ambience, the location, the service, the drinks, appetizers, and especially the meals. I will definitely be coming back here and likely ordering the same thing. They also have specials and that evening they had the ""Dom burger"" that looked delicious and the servers both said it was incredible. Although they totally understand coming to an Italian restaurant and ordering a burger is not common. I would recommend taking a rideshare service as parking is very sparse to impossible in the North End area. Also, if you are looking to doing some shopping a lot of them, like Mike's Pastry (down the street) which is a total desert staple and only takes cash. Enjoy and come hungry!> I went into a food coma after eating this gnocchi! Decadent layers of cheese and the pasta is so soft. I do have to say that the ambience is unusual compared to other Italian restaurants in Northend","5, 3, 4, 5, 4"

This hole-in-the-wall cozy establishment is a gem. We ordered the lamb skewers, hand pulled noodles, and house noodle soup. Everything was delicious! The noodles were perfectly thick and chewy, and every dish was well-seasoned. My only complaint is that they were actually too generous with the garlic on the hand pulled noodles. Despite taking out a lot of the garlic, it still overpowered the other spices. The menu is quite limited, but the items they do have are all cooked very well. Wish I could support them during the COVID-19 crisis, but unfortunately I am not in the area, so everyone else should go to Gene's to pick up some delicious Chinese comfort food!> Gene's flatbread is a little hole in the wall a short walk away from Downtown Crossing. It's a small restaurant with few tables and a small selection but my friends and I have always heard great things so we decided to check it out.Their menu isnt expansive but we got the cumin lamb hand pulled noodles, the hot and sour wonton soup, the pork flatbread, and the house noodle soup. The cumin hand pulled noodles were great. The noodles had a thick and slightly chewy texture and had a really nice flavor among with the lamb, bean sprouts, carrots and onions. Almost slightly spicy with some lemon. It's only 9 dollars and great in taste but wont really fill you up.My friends ordered the other items so I only got to taste. The dumpling soup was good but not great. You can tell it's made in house but they werent anything special. The broth was tasty but not as tasty as the house noodle soup, which has a phenomenal broth but normal rice noodles. The pork bun was standard. Nothing I'd say I'd recommend but a nice little snack if you're hungry.Overall, Gene's is definitely worth a try. Cheap with some great items, but it wont really keep you full unless you order more than one dish> After seeing Gene's on a recent Eater list, it was on my radar to try but the limited hours (closes at 7 most days) complicated my plans. I finally made it for a weekday lunch this week and really enjoyed the hand pulled noodles and single lamb skewer. The value was incredible ($8.50 for everything), service was prompt, and environment is super causal - epitome of hole in the wall.Both the noodles and lamb skewer were packed to the brim with flavor and spice, and I cannot wait time try the cold salad and the flatbread. Others who arrived after me ordered both and my mouth was watering even though I had just eaten terrific food and was full. The dumpling soup that had recently been added to the menu was also enticing - motivation to come back again soon :)I will say that the hand pulled noodles were tasty overall but not cooked 100% perfectly so some bites were a bit chewy. Not a major issue and didn't get in the way of me loving the meal, but just a small area for improvement to make every bite flawless.Will definitely be back soon!> I LOVED this place! Came on a Saturday afternoon, no lines. I got the hand pulled noodles, hot and sour hand pulled noodles, the skewers, and the pork sandwich. I liked the spicy hand pulled noodles the best. The soup one was great too, but I liked the regular one better. They were both pretty spicy. The sandwich was a little dry, but the skewers weren't, they were SO GOOD. Would def recommend. Everything was so cheap, our entire meal was $23. It was also way way more filling than I expected. The noodles are very thick. I loved it, I would def come back.> Cash only. Small hole in the wall. They're known for their hand pulled noodles. I got the hand pulled noodles with chili oil and a tea egg. The texture of the noodles had a nice chew to it. Only downside was that there was literally no broth to my noodles. The chili oil wasn't so much of chili oil but chili powder. Because the noodles did not have any broth and the chili was not oil, it was kind of hard eating the last half since the chili powder made it so dry with a chalky taste. Not comparable to other places I have tried but I would go back and try their hot and sour noodle soup if I ever come back to Boston.","4, 4, 5, 4, 4"

We didn't want something super touristy or super expensive, and this was perfect! We looked at the menu outside for a moment and were greeted by an employee asking if we had any questions. She wasn't pushy or salesy but made us feel welcome and we decided to dine. Three of us shared a Buddha of Mai Tai. It's 64oz (so ~4 servings) and dangerously easy to drink. We failed to take pictures but all had delicious meals. I had the Snow Mountain maki and spicy tuna maki. The snow mountain had bacon bits and a wonderful sauce, I loved it. Warning, the spicy tuna definitely had more heat to it than most other places so it IS spicy but yummy. The others had Walnut Chili Shrimp and Yellowfin Tuna. Despite how full we were, we shared a chocolate torte at the end. It was small but very rich and therefore a perfect little ending to a wonderful meal. The only downside was the combination of dim lighting and a graphically textured menu - it made it a bit hard to read. Otherwise though, I definitely recommend as a great somewhat hidden gem in a populated area!> Came here for galentine's with two other girl friends and we ordered the scallion pancake, street noodles, walnut chili shrimp, and an unagi roll. We all enjoyed the unagi roll and street noodles the most, followed by the scallion pancake and walnut chili shrimp (which we didn't really like) in that order. Portion sizes were pretty standard, and we were all very full after finishing most of our four dishes. The decor of the restaurant is definitely on point, and service was also great. We had a reservation for 3, and were seated upon arrival. Overall, I think Koy is a great place to check out if you're in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.> The goodWhile small the drinks were solidMusic was fine (both stylistically and volume)The BBQ sauce had a nice sweet smoky heat that was not overwhelmingThe bibimbap kept a good heat in the stone bowl but wasn't too flavorfulThe staff was very attentiveThe badOne of the worst salmon rolls I've ever had.

The pajon was not crispy enough for my liking, but was still flavorful. I finished with bibimbap and they had to bring more gojuchung out for us. I asked for the squirt bottle and they looked at me like I had 5 heads :) Staff was quick with bringing out more little bowls though.","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

My roommate and I live in the North End and so have made it our mission to try all of the restaurants in the neighborhood. Of the four new ones we've tried and some of our usual spots including some of the big names in the neighborhood Table has become our new favorite! We ordered the prosciutto wrapped burrata as a starter and it was fantastic. Great balance of creamy burrata and perfectly cured prosciutto with a distinctly flavorful pesto and tossed with heirloom tomatoes! The main attraction were the meatballs Best meatballs in the north end! Not sure if it's that housemade marinara with the hints of basil or the choice of both veal and pork that made it really stand out compared to every where else, but WOW. Hours laters we're still talking about our return. Excited to actually sit down at a 'Table' real soon!!!> The owner and staff of this place are providing a take out/delivery option during these tumultuous times. My boyfriend and I decided to support local business and enjoy Italian comfort food after some very uncomfortable days, and order delivery from Table via chownow (something they're recommending via their Instagram account, and something I've been following eagerly, waiting to try). I'll just shoot it to you straight - I have never in my life been spoken to the way the owner spoke to me on the phone after calling about an order that THEY messed up. After swearing several times, saying ""ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU'RE CALLING ABOUT TWO FUCKING MEATBALLS!?"" I didn't even get a chance to let her know that this meal is a splurge for us at upwards of $65. That said - yes, I ordered the rigatoni with meatballs, yes, chownow says the Marsala comes with penne - so why in God's name are you screaming at me when I'm simply inquiring to get what we paid for?Before people read through this, I'll have you know I NEVER raised my voice to this woman, mostly because I didn't have a chance to get a word in. Never mind the eggshell in our dish, I wasn't even going to mention that, because quite frankly shit happens (meatballs go missing, eggshells sometimes fall into the food, Jen), but how you handle it is a whole other story. So just a quick thank you for making an extremely shitty week, that much worse for two hardworking people who have been waiting to try your restaurant. As a couple with a vast, foodie network, not only do I hope you give us that refund tomorrow, but I also hope you can extend a heartfelt apology, because you've absolutely ruined our evening - not with missing meatballs, but with how you think you speak to another human being.> Haven't left a review in a while... but this experience was one I wanted to share. I had heard about this place when it first opened up, and have been waiting for a special occasion to splurge & try it out because I think the concept is great. I had been talking about this place for the longest time to friends & family and I was super bummed to report back about my overall experience to everyone.  I visited here with a friend two weeks ago for a late Christmas/New Year's dinner. The decor, & set up of the tables walking in is super cute. Definitely a vibe. They left the lights really bright for dinner which was kind of meh, would set a nice ambiance if lights were dim. Not a big deal, but you also couldn't hear the music very well, it is a small space & all the reservations were chatting so it gets loud. My understanding was that you share a table with others, but the courses come out for your and your party. It was set up to groups of 6. So we a party of 2 were seated with a party of 4. So the food that came out was portioned for 6 guests.The servers were polite, when we got there, we were checked in for our reservation. I would like to point out, that I didn't have open table until I had to make a reservation for the specific restaurant so I downloaded it. Apparently there is a reward system and you get points for going to restaurants that you make reservations for, I will circle back to this point later .We ordered 2 glasses of wine, & my friend then ordered a $55 bottle of wine. When we got to the table there was bread and garlic and olives, it was actually really tasty for me it was actually the tastiest thing of the entire night. There was nine courses I believe, and I have to say that everything that came out for my personal palate was bland, basic & underwhelming small portions for the $90 per person. The menu was a mixture of so many different things, There was a certain point where I kind of wanted it to be over but I was looking forward to the salad, and when the salad came out it was literally arugula doused in oil with some sunflower seeds. No flavor whatsoever. Again I was so looking forward to trying this place out so I don't know if my expectations were really high.I personally didn't eat a lot of the things that came out & pretty much a lot of it was still on my plate at the end of the night when it was cleared. Which is a cue in most restaurants for servers to at least ask if everything tasted ok. The bill came and we just dished out almost $300 for a meal that I was walking away hungry from. I went on the review outlets and noticed that the majority of the reviews are five stars which is great if other guests have had five star experiences when visiting. I noticed those who had lesser experiences expressed the same / similar experiences as we did. I actually work in reputation management for restaurants, and I was reading the emotional responses that the owner had to those who did not think that her restaurant offers a five-star experience. I decided not to leave a review at the time, but my friend decided to leave one on Google. Again I'm in repetition management for restaurants, so I have seen & responded to all sorts of reviews on behalf of restaurants. The owner responded back taking the review personally, And decided to go to open table to cancel my reservation so that I would lose the points that I had rightfully earned for committing to the reservation, showing up and paying $300 for a meal with gratuity. This reaction disappointed me even more & is why I am leaving this review. My friend left that review not me, and the unprofessional emotional reaction was mind boggling to me. i get as small business owners their passion is their purpose, but first and foremost entrepreneurs are running a BUSINESS. Feedback positive or negative is going to happen, it shouldn't be taken personal, but from a reputation management perspective should certainly be handled with tact. The establishment had no problem taking my $, but decided to take away the points as what? Retribution? Retaliation? To be honest it's not about the money, its about how your guests feel when they leave, &  its about providing VALUE for the price you are charging. The $ invested did not give me any value. I walked out hungry. I will never go back. Try it if you want, but foodie beware.> I have been wanting to go here for a long time but being from outside the city...I had avoided it. Last week the online photo's of the new antipasto struck my fancy and after a week of debating I placed my order online, selected pickup time, paid and received confirmation. I arrived right in time and I was greeted as I went in. My order was ready, checked and rechecked and I was offered silverware before I left. I wondered if it would look the same as the Instagram photo I had seen. Much to my surprise if made it home looking just as good. The portion was more than generous. It stated for two but was lunch for over 2 days. The cannoli's were well worth it. Note this review is simply of takeout...I have not been for their traditional dinner but when they reopen for that..I'll be back!> Owner called people the C word, published an add asking for a non Spanish speaking dishwasher she has horrible food and a worse attitude","5, 1, 1, 5, 1"

Amongst my favorite dishes, these have to be my top 3 1. Dried scallop fried rice 2. Salt and Pepper Pork Chop 3. Crispy Pork Belly The duck, char-siu and crispy pan fried noodles are also great! The quality of these dishes is unparalleled and the serving sizes are enormous. Given all of this, I would recommend taking out or ordering your food via Uber Eats or GrubHub (the menu here though is not as extensive for some reason). The atmosphere of the restaurant is your average Chinese bustling space but the food is just as fresh taken out and even better enjoyed at the comfort of your own home.> Loved, loved, loved it! I came back twice on a long weekend trip to Boston. While I did not care for the service when I picked up my to go order of house special fried rice and wonton noodle soup around 5 pm on Friday, I returned the next day for lunch because the food is that good. I think because the place serves Cantonese style dishes and its name is Hong Kong Eatery, the main folks who interact with customers speak English and Chinese. When I called to pick up my order, the woman conversed with me in English and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. On Saturday, I spoke Cantonese with the server. He initially provided us with a kettle of tea and I requested two glasses of water.  I noticed many other customers ordering dishes, eating what they could/wanted and asking for the leftovers to be boxed and bagged up. I guess that's why the server wasn't surprised about my party of two ordering a bowl of plain porridge ($2.95), one you tiao (fried dough, $2.95), a plate of shrimp scrambled egg rice ($8.95), a plate of house special fried rice ($8.95), and a bowl of wonton soup ($7.95). These tend to be my general go-tos, especially the fried rice and wontons. Ever since I was a kid, I have loved a good fried rice, and sadly, not many places make it well. I believe if you order and eat in the restaurant, you get more food than if you were to do takeout. My comparison was done on the fried rice. We definitely had a mountain of it at the restaurant and ate a good amount before asking it to be wrapped up. The amount of food in that box was similar to what we received the day before. The wontons and soup are delicious and for plain porridge (congee), I thought it was creamy and flavorful. Mei Sum serves a small cup of congee with duck eggs, scallions, and beef for $2.25 and it would be hard to decide which is better given its size and flavors. You tiao at both, while not a must, is a highly recommend for lapping up the remaining congee in the bowl. I didn't think the shrimp scrambled egg rice was anything special. The rice tasted a little hard and I found the peas under cooked. The eggs were good. I was astonished by its size though. For less than $60 for both trips, we had plenty of delicious, comforting, and familiar dishes.> Hong Kong Eatery is a staple in Chinatown. They serve up classic Cantonese dishes and the food is consistently good. The wontons here are probably one of the best in Chinatown They really pack each wonton with meat and shrimp! Surprisingly, they have really good HK milk teas but one thing to note is that they always seem to run out of them during dinner time. I guess with competing bubble tea shops in the area, they aren't too worried about it.> Came by to get some to go soup for hubby. I went to a bubble tea nearby and it's not far from where I parked. Since they still do take outs since this pandemic is going on around the world. The area inside is quite small. There were only few tables in there I'm sure it gets packed when it's busy. Had to wait for my order for about 5 or like 7 mins. They cook the stuff fresh after you order it so it's freshly done when you get it, which is good. But I'm not too sure for those people who are in a rush. I also got the roasted pork which tasted just like the typical Chinese roasted pork that you get in most places, there's nothing really special to it's taste for me honestly. I also ate it the next day. So I don't know if it's one of the factors. But as far as the other people who ordered without a soup it was out in less than 5mins plus it's totally not busy around this time.> I've been to Boston PLENTY of times to visit family as well as for work.  And sure, I've dined at institutions and other ""must eats"" during my travels.  So by all means, while strolling around Beantown, be sure to stop in the Regina Pizzeria and have The Giambotta; indulge in a huge pastrami sandwich at Sam LaGrassa's; and of course, go to the Union Oyster House for a bowl of their legendary New England clam chowder.  However, after a few days, I always get a hankering for my own kind of comfort food, aka Cantonese cuisine.  Anytime I see the words ""Hong Kong"" in the title of a restaurant, my interest is immediately piqued, mainly because I want to see if that place can justify having my birthplace in its name.I also was encouraged that Hong Kong Eatery received high marks from long time trusted Yelper (and one time Bostonian) Susan H, so I ventured into the compact section of the Boston Chinatown neighborhood in search of some tasty grub.At first glance, this joint has the familiar trappings of a classic Chinese restaurants found all along the East Coast.  The front window has a selection of roasted and barbecued meats, and the interior has tightly arranged tables to maximize the number of people that can get squeezed into the cramped dining room.  As a side note, what's up with EVERY Chinese restaurant needing to have long-walls that are lined with mirrors?  When trying a new Cantonese restaurant, always need to determine how the kitchen prepares the classic Wonton Soup.  I was a bit on the hungry side since I walked about 20 min from my hotel, so I also added two meats to my dish - some bbq char siu pork and Chinese style beef brisket.  Let me say up front, the wontons themselves were delicious.  The dumpling skin was tightly wrapped around a package of seasoned pork and shrimp based filling.  And unlike at some places which serves puny wontons, these versions were a good size.  I deduct some stars since the accompanying meats, particularly the char siu was very subpar.  Usually good char siu is tender with a nice glaze which is not overly sweet, but where you can also taste hints of five spice and soy sauce.  The roasted pork here was tough and tasted like it had been hanging in the window too long resulting in the meat drying out.  Beef brisket was okay.  Some pieces were very tender, whereas, other pieces were on the fatty side and too tough.  IMHO, not worth the extra $3.This place is pretty popular with the locals and I observed LOTS of students from the numerous colleges popping in for take out and dishes of roasted meats over rice platters.  It's a challenge to rate this place, especially if you've been to other more famous Chinatown neighborhoods in places like NY and San Fran.  But overall, this place ain't bad and will satisfy the craving for good Cantonese food if visiting Boston.","5, 5, 3, 4, 3"

I would highly recommend to call in advance for a large table.

The seafood was very fresh and delicious. Definitely try the ""King Crab Legs"".Great customer service! All the staff were very friendly and responsive.Will definitely return.> My boyfriend and I literally came to Boston because we were bamboozled by a Strictly Dumpling video, and this was one of the places that they visited. Honestly I doubted that Asians do lobster better but this place completely changed my mind.We ordered the XO lobster with sticky rice, fried tofu pods, and snow pea leaves. That XO lobster dish was AMAZING. I highly recommend (like Mike Chen said) asking for their homemade chili sauce because it just makes the lobster dish somehow even better. I have no idea what XO sauce is but it's delicious. The rice was sticky as described but you could still separate out the individual kernels. Lobster was the bomb dot com and I honestly wish we had ordered another XO dish. There were a million tofu pods (go Asians for bang for your buck) and they were perfectly fried but still soft on the inside. They also came with a great dipping sauce. The snow pea leaves were pretty standard and good and we ordered them more to get some vegetables in our system. Thank you Mike and Jean for the recommendation!! Best lobster dish imo> Very good especially for the lobster in a variety of ways not over cooked and very juicy and flavorful. We had the fried garlic lobster and it was awesome. The soft shell crab in an egg batter was delicious but didnt taste like crab but this is the first time I've had soft shell crab at all so I don't have a point of reference. But I must say that although it was fried properly it was a bit like an oil sponge so I felt compelled to ask for a couple of slices of lemon which is good with seafood anyway. Yang Chow fried rice, Beef Chow Foon... are not the reason to come here stick to the seafood. Also I found out that if you order the beef chow foon saucy so to speak they don't include the beansprouts which I love yang chow fried rice doesn't bring bean sprouts either and I forgot to ask them to add them. Bummer. Salt and pepPer wings were underwhelming but fried beautifully just lacking in taste. Surprise of the night was fish maw in a seafood soup as I tasted this wonderful rubbery piece of fish air bladder I had to call over the waiter to ask him if my ""seafood"" soup had beef tripe (which I love btw) so similar in appearance taste and texture was it to beef tripe. I will definitely be exploring this curious and delightful organ in the future and recommend you do the same. Till next time love peace and bacon greaseJose B.> The menu here is almost frighteningly large. They have all the usual Chinese restaurant options in addition to their specialty seafood. We ordered salt and pepper squid as well as a sizzling scallop dish. Both of the delicious were really good and came out quickly.","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

It is by far my favorite out if the choices you have around the chinatown/downtown area. A little bit on the pricey side when you compare it to shabu-zen or other hotpot places around, however it is well worth the slight increase in price. My reasons is the quality of the meats and the flavor of the broth. My absolute favorites here are either the spicy mala or the pork bone broth. Get the mala if you enjoy spicy and pork bone if you don't. As for the meat, you really can't gone wrong with any of them, my personal all time favorite and what I get every time is the prime rib. Its got the right amount of meat to fat in my opinion. Get that and the mixed veggie combo and you're set for a great meal.> Not sure who makes the time estimates but we joined the waitlist at 6:11pm. According to yelp waitlist, we arrived just before 6:53. We didn't sit down until 8:42pm. I felt like I was being strung along and the people I was dining with were also very frustrated.Fortunately when we finally sat down, we were able to order quickly and got our food quickly as well. The food was good. They have a wide variety of cuisine and use good quality ingredients.> My fiancé and I came here on a really busy Saturday night(tonight) and we waited over an hour and a half to be seated which we didn't mind because we got drinks from the place across the street. Of course then we became very hungry and just wanted to eat! This was our first time trying hot pot in Boston. We are from New York and have tried hot pot all over the city so we did not expect much at this restaurant. Let's talk about the food and the service after we were finally seated. 1. The food was great! Definitely one of the better hot pot places we have tried. We tried the black chicken bone broth and the mala broth. Make sure to try both soup bases before you start cooking the food. So delicious! We got an assortment of vegetables, seafood and the fatty sirloin. The mussels, scallops and the fatty sirloin were our favorite! I also got a mojito and my fiancé got a glass of the Pinot. The food and drinks were delicious!2. Our service started out amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and very polite. We even got more soup for our broths without even asking. Sounds great right? Then the 45 minute mark hit and we were ready to order more food and drinks so we asked for more soup for our broths. But a few minutes after we were served the waiter came over with the check and turned off our stove...We were so confused because we still had food on our plate that we didn't get to get and wanted to order more. We both felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome afterwards we quickly ate our food and paid the bill. We understood it was a busy night and they just wanted to get other people seated but it didn't make any sense to indirectly kick us out without even asking if we wanted anything else. We were going to ask if there was a time limit per table but didn't even bother because it became so awkward since we felt so rushed.Overall I would have given the place a 4 star rating if not for the service towards the end. The food was great but the customer service just did not live up to par. We would love to go back on a day that's not as busy. Hopefully we have a much better experience next time!> I have been here several time and every time I come the service is borderline mediocre from the host to the waiter. The place is relatively large as they serve hotpot and sushi. I have been to many hotpot restaurants and by far Q is not the worst but it is not the best in terms of quality of meat. Yes, they offer pretty much what other places offer but I find the food just okay. There is nothing that wows me here!> Amazing hot pot!!!! So much fun and delicious.Waygu short rib was fantastic. The Mala broth was very spicy but delicious . Great place!!!!!!!","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Nice staff.Southie definitely needed a place like this!!!> This is going to be my new favorite place of all time. 1) Everyone was so incredibly nice and had a strong knowledge base of the menu. So so so receptive to feedback. The owners were so kind and genuinely had an interest in our experience. 2) the food was AMAZING. tried the Shakshuka, the burger, the carrot cupcake, the cookie, the mushroom tea, the brain juice, and the banana bread. Needless to say, I was there for a while. Everything was delicious. Fave was definitely the carrot cupcake. Still craving it now. 3) everything is so healthy and fresh. The ingredient choices are thoughtful and the combinations just make sense. They don't sacrifice flavor at all but still manage to make all the food delightful.  I will 100% be coming back! I need to be adopted into the LULUGREEN family.> Wow, so good. I got the winter quinoa bowl and after one bite I'm sold. Happy to have a spot like this in the neighborhood. Looking forward to trying more of their items. The staff was extremely nice, friendly and knowledgeable too. You can tell they really care about making high quality food. Well done!> I went to Lulu shortly after they opened. They were giving out delicious fudgy brownie samples, and I tried the pear ginger scone from the bakery case. I thought it had good flavor, but I didn't love the texture. I enjoyed a pear jasmine kombucha, and I also had the barbecued cauliflower. It had really delicious flavors and good bread (it tastes grilled not like bbq sauce). I would definitely get it again without the vegan cheese. I look forward to going back and trying their full menu, especially the waffles!> Awesome spot for a fresh and healthy lunch! My friend and I checked it out today and were so impressed! I had the cauliflower sandwich and she had the burger. Both were flavorful and delicious! All of the staff were extremely kind and helpful, and made us feel very welcome. The rest of the menu (and all the baked goods) looks awesome! Can't wait to return!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

It's perfect spot to hang out with the girlfriends for couple drinks & appetizers for a fun day in Boston, or enjoy a date night with someone special. Food won't disappoint. Def is a little on the pricey side, but it's worth it.> The was great, our waitress was great and the female bar tender who served us before our meal was also awesome! Highly recommend stopping here for a meal or a drink if you're in the area. The mimosa was absolute perfection - A lot of places go too heavy on the OJ and our bartender had the right ratio! So why am I docking a star? The hostesses were very rude! When we first came in, I also walked back out because one of them was on her phone and the other let out a huge, irritated sigh because I interrupted whatever she was doing in the reservation book. I felt like I was inconveniencing them by asking for a table! When I mentioned we wanted to go to the bar first, the response I got was a sarcastic 'go nuts - Knock yourself out.' No goodbyes when we left even though there were three of them there. To the managers - You've trained your waitstaff and bar tenders so well! Time to work on the front of the house!> I was part of a group of 5 total to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at Abe and Louies with a reservation via Open Table at 7 PM.We arrived early at around 640 PM.Valet parked across the street at the Prudential garage. Cost was $21 plus tip. We were seated before 7 PM.Our server Kenny was great. He knew the menu, directed us to the better items on the menu, and was friendly.Our water glasses were filled and an assortment of bread was brought out. Bread was pretty good, nice variety in my opinion. The restaurant was comfortable and warm. A lot of wood around the dining area. Looked pretty nice overall. This was our first time at this restaurant.We started off with the chilled raw oysters and the burrata for appetizers. Both were fresh and very good. I agree with another review that there should be greater variety for appetizers as most here are raw or seafood based. None in the party had wine with the dinner. For the main entrees 2 people had the aged prime ribeye which was delicious. My steak was ordered medium but was mostly medium rare overall. Still very tasty and tender. Nicely seasoned with a good char. One person in the party had the aged prime delmonico cooked medium. Was also perfectly done and tender and juicy. Another had the Aged prime New York Sirloin. The last person in the group had the Salmon Fillet. I had a taste of it and it was cooked nicely with good flavor. Seemed very fresh as well. For side the table shared Potatoes au Gratin, asparagus and the lobster Mac and cheese. These sides are large and Kenny our server had mentioned they can feed 2 to 3 people. I tried all three and they were all very good. I believe the table finished all of the sides. Overall it was a very nice dining experience. The restaurant was a little loud later on since there were a few 10 to 12 person parties going on. I would recommend Abe and Louies to anyone looking for a great meal. I would visit again as well. Thank you Kenny and thank you Abe and Louies.> One of the best rib eyes in town! Your classic upscale white glove steak house. Small intimate feel compared to the other local steakhouses. They do a great potatoes au gratin. Their lobster Mac and cheese is somewhat bland. Broccoli and brussels sprouts are well cooked and well seasoned. Sad to say that I've actually never tried their dessert.> Just a quick note...My GF/I had dinner yesterday(2/23).  While the food/service was impeccable.  The dining atmosphere there has really gone downhill.  One table near us was inhabited by a family with extremely LOUD and UNRULY toddlers who were given free reign to wander about and bother other guests.  Another table was populated by a group of drinking/foul talking woman...who I would swear doubled as longshoremen considering their language.  Finally, ballcaps in the Dining Room? When did Abe and Louie's start serving hot dogs??  As a repeat diner there I was very disappointed by all of this.  It is not what I would expect out of $300+ dining experience.I hope you make some improvements in the future.  I would LOVE to return again soon...but this last visit does cast some doubt on this.","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

The neighborhood favorite opens up at 1130am Mon-Sat and is normally sold out of its limited menu by 2pm. Ralph and Arthur run a pretty tight ship. Everything is made fresh daily and there are no substitutions, featured items or surprises of any kind!One type of Sicilian style cheese pizza is served by the slice (~$2 a piece, cash only). There are a handful of other menu options, of which the arancini is certainly the crown jewel. House wine is served at just under $3, making this one of the last places in town you can have a meal and a drink for under $5. This is not necessarily the best pizza you'll eat in your life, but it is consistently fresh and delicious. In short, this is a spot you'll want to experience as a regular rather than a tourist. One of the few Boston establishments worth the long lineup.> We stopped in here around 11:45am on a Saturday in February. There were about 15 people in line in front of us and the line took about that long, 15 minutes, which was somewhat surprising to me. Kinda thought it would be a little quicker since everything is already cooked. When it was my turn we got 2 slices and a spinach & cheese calzone, and a pepsi.  It was $10.45 - can't beat the prices.  I wanted to try pretty much everything but we were making multiple stops in the area for a little food tour. The pizza was good but not wait in line for much longer than I did good. The line got a lot worse before we left. The spinach and cheese calzone was okay in my opinion but my girlfriend liked it. I guess all the good pizza in my home area made it not seem too memorable. They had arancini, pizzette, paninis and panzarotti as well -- all cheap prices. The staff are excellent and they move very fast, it's just that there were 2 guys doing the counter for an endless line. One was doing to go orders which were massive like 10 slices and whatnot. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but I do want to try the arancini sometime.> Last month, my friend and I went here for lunch. There was a long queue of about 20 people but the line moved pretty quickly. I got two Sicilian cheese slices and a spinach and cheese calzone. Although a bit burnt, the cheese slices were cheesy, airy and crispy.  Very yummy! You can't beat a $1.85 Sicilian slice.The spinach and cheese calzone for $5 was also warm and tasty. If you want a good quality lunch under $10, I highly recommend this place.> I like the old-school charm of this place, but the food didn't really stand out.I got a slice of their pizza and wasn't very impressed: the crust wasn't very crispy and I thought that the cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. A little disappointing given how big a fan I am of the square slice and the hype reviews for this place.Will say though, given that it only set me back $2 and the service was friendly, I've made worse decisions in my life.> Mama Mia, that's good pan pizza!! And at $1.90 a slice, you can't beat it with a stick!! Mangia! Mangia!","5, 4, 4, 3, 4"

It has about 15 tables ranging from 2-4 people with a ""bar seating"" set up. There is no music in the Resturant so it's the ideal spot to have conversation. While the restaurant is small, it isn't noisy. BRIGHT: The entire restaurant has white table tops and the walls are painted white which really elevated the overall happy vibe people exude while they are in the Resturant. From Watching HGTV, I know the extra space perceived in a white kitchen as well as how much more calm and soothing a white kitchen is. HALF-CHICKEN: I had the half chicken which was really well done. It had a light crisp exterior and a very juicy interior. It came with fingerling potatoes and greens. Overall the dish was very filling and I would get it again. At the same time, if you aren't ""that hungry"" look at another plate unless you want lunch for the next day. Pro tip: definitely make a reservation between 6-8:30pm. This is a popular spot. Pro tip: grab a drink downstairs at their sister bar ""drink"" to either start or end your night.> Really good food, but a bit pricyWe went to Sportello as a part of Dine Out Boston 2020. Unfortunately, that Prix fix menu didn't really appeal to anyone in our group and we ordered off the normal lunch menu. The food was really good (I had the Roasted Half-Chicken) and the service was excellent. However, our bill (with a drink) came out to over $50 a person which is a bit pricy for lunch.> In early December, I dinned with friends and former coworkers at Sportello in Boston. I had eaten here multiple times previously when I worked just down the street, but now that I had been out of the city for a year, I thought a visit to an old friend was worth it.  And as a result, a Yelp! Review.  The staff is always accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu.  From recommending wine to offering opinions on their favorite dishes, it is refreshing to hear the staff take a stance vs. feeling like they have never tried anything on the menu before.  For pasta which is made in house every day, you can't go wrong.  The gnocchi were thoroughly enjoyed with infused lobster and the tagliatelle with bolognese meat sauce was probably the best tasting at our table.  The squash risotto was tender with hints of brown butter and parmigiana.  Meanwhile the pork chop was also juicy and cooked to perfection.  We didn't save room for desserts, but we were certainly tempted by the cannoli and coconut cake offerings.  I missed you old friend, and am already looking forward to my next visit.  I recommend Sportello when you are in the Financial or Seaport districts of Boston.> My boyfriend and I had received many recommendations for this restaurant so we finally got around to trying it. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and were sat at the swanky bar. The atmosphere was very chic but a quiet and a little stuffy for my taste. The menu is a bit confusing, it includes a ""let us cook for you"" section and a la carte but it's not clear what this means. We figured our waitress would explain this to us but instead after having to flag down a different waitress to order drinks and then once our original waitress approached us again she pressured us to order right away and seemed annoyed when we kind of fumbled around the menu. We ended up ordering the Tagliatelle, duck and side of Broccolini. Each was very good but in truth way too expensive for what it was. It was fun to try because it's been considered a hot spot for about a year but I won't be returning.> Best pasta I've had to date! I got the potato gnocchi and it was heavenly. The gnocchi just melts perfectly into your mouth. It was an exquisite blend of flavors with truffle infusion, mushrooms, peas, and lobster. Highly recommend! The food came out incredibly quick and I was surprised to be able to be seated immediately despite my entire party not showing up yet. Got the melon and vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over it for dessert. I would skip just because it was two scoops with ice cream with an espresso shot layered over it for $10, cost benefit analysis does not add up.","5, 3, 4, 3, 3"

I initially came here for the kimbap rolls; however, they've removed it from their menu. We tried their bulgogi beef taco ($3.50), kalbi short rib taco ($5.00), chicken poppers ($10.95), kimchi fritas ($5.95) and small yang yum flavored korean fried chicken ($8.95). Our favorite was the chicken poppers; the portion was large for the price. Our least favorite were the tacos because they gave us little to no meat and was unseasoned; the tacos were stuffed with homemade slaw than anything else.> Chicken Poppers, Coreanos Bowl, miso soup. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! One of the Coreanos bowls had beef and the other had tofu, VERY flavorful and filling. Worth the prices without a doubt!> One of my favorite korean places in boston ! A little on the expensive side but the coreanos bowl is amazing ! Sweet and spicy. Tteokboki was little expensive for an app, and didn't come with much rice cakes but it was really yummy. The plain fried chicken was great, super crunchy and juicy at the same time. Personally I like it better without any flavoring. Ordered to go, and it was ready in 20 mins on a friday night.

Absolutely over the top dining experience. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere. Steak cooked to perfection! Came for DineoutBoston March 2020 and they were incredibly generous with their portion size. Their snicker sundae is to die for!> I have to say that the steak I had at Grill 23 was the best I've ever had in Boston! Me and the rest of my party got the 100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye (Medium Rare). It was incredibly tender with just the right amount of sauce and crisp! They've also got a vast selection of wine to pair with your meal. Their sides were also made quite well (especially the Grill 23 Tots). I made my table reservation through OpenTable and my personal request was well-met. The entire restaurant was filled the night that we were here, so it was quite difficult to hear sometimes with all the conversations going on.> Updated in December 2019:Grill 23 consistently provides both incredible food and service and I'm here to give it that fifth star. All I really need to say is that not one, not two, but THREE bartenders have independently remembered me, and both where I like to sit and what I like to order. I can't name a single other restaurant where I've experienced hospitality like this, and it really stands out.Luckily, in my opinion the food really does match up to the charm, which is not something you might expect given how upscale the dining room is. There's no question that the restaurant caters to an older and classier crowd, and seems to host a lot of family gatherings and business meetings, but if you have a chance to stop in to the bar for a nice meal I highly recommend you do so.First of all, the 100 day (wet) aged prime rib-eye is a stunner, featuring 18 oz of meat from Brandt farms for $60 (previously $59). I tend to be quite disappointed with wet aging, but this is probably one of the finest examples of the technique I've ever eaten. The flavor of the steak is robust and complex, and I promise you won't be disappointed. I've compared it myself to their own dry-aged prime NY strip and I vastly prefer the ribeye, although your mileage may vary. That said, I wouldn't recommend ordering this cooked anything beyond medium rare (Grill 23 is also one of the only places that can properly do a rare plus, which would be my recommendation) as you'll lose a good amount of both flavor and texture.The bar burger itself is also a success in my opinion. It seems the blend itself may change with the season, but when I ordered it there was American Wagyu in the blend, along with a layer of thick-cut bacon and a really fantastic remoulade. It honestly took me by surprise, and the herb & parmesan fries it comes with are also delicious. I was tempted to call it the best burger I've had in Boston, but I have to try again before making sure.If I wanted to have a classic meal in town, perhaps something that would satisfy the whole family, Grill 23 would be at the top of my list. Sometimes tradition tends to outweigh culinary excitement, but Grill 23 is the rare exception, where memorable service and delicious food go hand in hand.> My husband and I went on a 'Steak Tour' in 2018, trying to find the best steak in Boston. We ended up finding the best place, and this is it! We've been back about 20 times since then, and it may have saved our marriage more than once. Since Yelp has a 5000 character limit, please see the photos for a full review of all the dishes that we have tried (about 10,000 characters!). We typically get and share two appetizers, one entree, one or two sides and dessert. We almost never get to try the non-steak entrees as we come here when we crave steak (and by steak, we mean specifically their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye""). But for those who don't want to read:TL/DR: Everything is good but their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye"" is the BEST steak in Boston.> The least expensive entree at Grill 23 & Bar is their vegetarian option - Spring Mushrooms & Wheat Berries $29 arugula, parmesan, citrus.  For entrees with animal protein, it was their Steak Frites $33.  A la carte pricing starts at $36 (swordfish steak 10 oz) and $38 (twin filets 8 oz), while side dishes to accompany them ranged from $12 (for their mashed potatoes and heirloom carrots) to $16 (stuffed mushrooms).  Thus it took Dine Out Boston (aka Restaurant Week, aka RW) to lure me in through their doors.Just as I was about to sit down, I noticed that water had dripped on to my seat.  They quickly wiped it up and apologized.  A bread basket with an assortment from red speckled flatbread to twin fluffy rolls, with squares of focaccia, and sliced brown bread of sorts tucked in.  The butter was soft and spreadable.  My personal favorite were the sweet rolls.Their $38 3 course Dine Out menu was printed right on the bottom of that day's single sheet menu.  I had no trouble making my choices:CORN CHOWDERwith roasted peppers & charred cornBRANDT FLAT IRON STEAKduck fat poached potatoes, parmesan creamed kale LEMON CURD TARTwith blueberry preserves, malted meringuesThough I also got to sample my DC's choices which differed from mine (we all picked the steak as our entree):CLAM & GREEN ONION FRITTERSwith bacon remoulade, friseeBROWNIE SUNDAEwith raspberry swirl ice cream, white chocolate puffed riceOf the appetizers, I felt mine to be the better pick, as the fritters were soft and not very meaty.  We all ordered our steak to be medium rare, but the results ranged a bit more than to be expected.  One friend's steak was a bit thinner, and so that might have been a reason for her steak to be closer to medium than the rest, however it was still not ideal.  The potatoes were buttery, and the creamed kale a nice touch.  Both desserts were well enjoyed, and we each felt we made the better choice.  A sweet ending to an enjoyable meal.We wondered if this would be one of those classy establishments which would have those cool crumb scrapers.  Well, definitely not after the first course, however, the bus boy was impressive as he quickly and professionally cleared our table of appetizer plates in one trip, while playing plate Tetris.  Later when he was about to set down the utensils for the dessert course, out came the scraper!The longest wait was for dessert.  Otherwise the timing was satisfactory.$21 valet parking.  Individual gendered bathrooms.  Noisier a space than I like prefer.  I wonder if it might have been more quiet upstairs.","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

Music was very entertaining and the atmosphere was inviting to have a good time. The only thing I have to say is that while guests are waiting to be seated since the place is too small there was really not an area were we could hang were we didn't feel like a bother to the waiting staff. I also thought of some of the appetizers a bit pricey for the portions. (Empanadas, tasty but is just one small empanada cut in half). We asked for water and they never brought us, but they were as attentive as they could.> To be fair, I've only been here for taco Tuesday but it's not the best in town. On Tuesday's their tacos are half price ($2.50), but this excludes some of their best selections so be sure to ask before you order!The chips and salsa have increased in price, and I always find it a little off putting when you have to pay for them to begin with, but they're worth it. Salsa is fresh and authentic.My go to's are the chicken, fried fish, and shredded beef Lorenza tacos. They're not always consistent as the chefs may rotate, but you get a good bang for your buck. My favorite is the Lorenza, but beware it's excluded from the Tuesday deal.But the churros are an ABSOLUTE MUST. They're my favorite in the city thus far, and I've had plenty. They're fat and crispy on the outside but thick enough that they're still soft and squishy on the inside. I hate it when they're too thin and fried to a crisp but these are perfection!> From being a transplant to Boston from San Diego, I have high expectations for good Mexican food. I can say that this place didn't disappoint. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing. There's a few tables outside for warm days. I got chicken enchiladas a mix of rojo & verde and they were amazing paired with a Hibiscus margarita which were both amazing. I can't wait to go back> I have both eaten in and ordered from El Centro. Both times I got a combination of different tacos. All of them were delicious. I have also tried the margarita and it was pretty delicious. Really recommend to anyone looking for Mexican food in the South End!> By far the best & most authentic mexican food in Boston. The plates here are to die for & so are the margaritas. Cant go wrong with tacos, toastada, or one of the specials. The carnitas verde was expecially good. FYi no reservations here!","4, 4, 5, 5, 5"

Thank you guys for being so flexible and for sharing your food with us in these trying times.> This review is for their Dine Out Boston menu ($33/person for 3 courses), so it may not be the most representative of their regular menu. Sadly the Dine Out Boston menu was a big disappointment...The meal started with some tasty bread that came with roasted garlic in olive oil. The bread was awesome-- super soft on the inside with a chewy crust. This made me very hopeful for the rest of the meal, but unfortunately I think the bread was the highlight for me.For the appetizers we tried both the chicories and herb salad and the shrimp & grits. The salad tasted very refreshing because it had fruits (apples and pomegranate) in addition to a bright, tangy vinaigrette. But it wasn't terribly special and I feel like I could get a similar tasting salad at a typical cafe. The shrimp & grits was nicely seasoned. The grits were shaped into a cake and seared, which formed a crispy base. But again, it tasted like something I could easily make at home.The entrees were pretty disappointing. The braise pork osso bucco was extremely dry and came with a heaping serving of equally dry beans. The seared black bass was tender, but pretty bland and came with another excessively large serving of cabbage. The protein-to-vegetable ratio on the two entrees seemed off balance. I probably wouldn't complain so much if the vegetables tasted better, but unfortunately they weren't anything special.We both got the blueberry miso crumb cake for dessert. The serving was pretty big-- each plate came with 3 small slices of cake. The cake wasn't too sweet and paired well with the blueberry compote and creme fraiche.Food-wise, I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by my visit. However the servers were very attentive and friendly. If their regular menu items are anything like the Dine Out Boston menu items, then I definitely won't be coming back.> Honestly I would give Metropolis a 1 Star had it not been for the good customer service.My coworker had heard this was a tasty restaurant, so I came in on a Saturday for brunch with high hopes and an empty stomach! I ordered what seems to be quite popular here, the huevos rancheros. As you can see by my picture, the item that came out was really disappointing. There was what looks to be a slice of Krafts single cheese slabbed onto my brunch order.... they couldn't even melt it for me?! Looking back at Yelp pictures, it seems as if the cheese is normally grated and placed on the order, which begs the question of WHAT HAPPENED?? How lazy can you be?!Aside from the cheese slice, the tortilla strips on the top were stale and the meat in the huevos rancheros was hard :( Honestly, everything with the order was just unimpressive. My friends ordered the pastrami hash and they said that item wasn't good either. There were wayyy too many strike outs during my visit for me to return. Unfortunately, Metropolis was a no for me.> Great date spot. My wife and I live around the corner from this place and finally made it over. We were very satisfied. I had the duck breast and my wife had the rigatoni.  Both were amazing. The duck was basically perfectly cooked and flavor was awesome. The sauce of the rigatoni was also very good. The service was great and we'd definitely go back with some friends. The place is tiny and reservations were tough. We went really early on a Saturday afternoon and we were okay.> Over ten years later and Metropolis is still a stand out. The menu is largely unchanged - chicken, veal (well, really the cauliflower gratin side) and rigatoni all phenomenal. Salads are all really solid and the Brussels sprouts dish is a sleeper on the app menu. Simple cocktails and solid wine list. And best of all, it's cozy as all heck. Though I no longer live in SoEnd, it's places like Metropolis that make me miss it desperately. Ask any local to the 'hood and it'll be on their top 5 list, trust me","5, 3, 2, 4, 5"

We found this place on Yelp and went in for a weekend lunch. It's a small spot but has nice design.Most importantly, the food was excellent. We've been to Thai restaurants all over the country, and this has to be one of the best we've tried. The basil fried rice, the drunken noodles, and the garlic stir fry dishes were all amazing. The only item I didn't love was the Galangal soup.If you're nearby at Quincy Market, this is definitely a place worth checking out.> Hands down BEST Thai in Boston. Cheap meals between 9-14 dollars for all entrees. Myanmar flair for the pork and shrimp noodle dish. Home made ice cream options. Spicy levels that are actually spicy.  These are real Thai people serving real Thai food. I love pad anything but many Thai places make it too greasy or the noodles are not a good texture. Not here. You can tell the ingredients are high quality despite the low prices and the small size of the joint. I believe it's new. Come eat here before they raise their prices.> We wanted to avail of the new Door Dash credit that comes with Chase Sapphire and a friend recommended we order-in Kala Thai. Our friends ordered the standard noodle dishes and found it quite decent, but the 4 of us who ordered the curries found them outstanding so I was happy with my choice. I'm one of those weirdos who loves pineapples in other foods (Hawaiian pizzas anyone??) and the pineapple curry was just the right amount of spice for me. I found it interesting how the brown rice was cheaper than jasmine white rice which costs at extra 50 cents. Perhaps they are just trying to encourage healthy eating? It seemed to work if that was the case as we all stuck the whole grain brown option.> Short summary of Kala Thai Cookery: Food was great. Prices were great. Service was not so great. I ordered the Spicy Noodle Soup with shrimp and egg noodles. I received Spicy Noodle Soup with shrimp and rice noodles. I didn't complain however due to the fact that I also like rice noodles. So I went about my business chatting during dinner time and slurping my noodles. My noodle soup was served beautifully: in a deep dish noodle bowl and garnished with scallions and chopped peanuts. I was given chop sticks and a noodle spoon without me asking which was nice! The ambiance is lively here. The decor is quite trendy! There is plenty of seating although tightly packed together. There seems to always be a line for take out. I'm not surprised at all because the food is very good and the prices are very affordable. The only other snafoo I experienced at dinner time was that my card was charged for the wrong bill. Once we alerted the waiter, it took some time but he remedied the situation. All in all, I would certainly return back here. The food and prices are too good!> GPS gave us a hard time with this place. It was worth the walk in the cold.I ordered the Kee Mao and it was very tasty! Just the right balance of heat and sweet. My friend ordered the pineapple curry and while I didn't taste it, she loved it.We arrived at 5:30PM and it was pretty empty inside but the crowd really picked up around 6. Service is timely and super helpful. When I couldn't decide between the Pad Thai and Kee Mao the waitress suggested the more popular one. Truly worth it.Would recommend!","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

All the staff are quite friendly and real so it's worth to try dishes I don't really into their lemon chicken wings but they are tender and juicy maybe I prefer more strong taste instead of sour and fresh flavor. But their cream spaghetti is really good good good! The cream is delightful with milky and thick texture. It also keeps meet tender and seasoned just right to melt with the sauce! The bread are chewy and fragrant with cereals flavor!> This place delivers yummy looking food, albeit a bit pricey. The pasta selections seem very tasty but at an ave of around $15, I'm not sure I would make this my everyday lunch fare. I opted for the meatball sub that turned out to be quite tasty. It was def a large portion but the ingredients were fresh & tasty. I couldn't manage to eat all the meatballs bc it just seemed too much. Overall it was a good meal & will definitely be back to try more.> Cajun alfredo on anything and everything! Put it on subs and pasta!!! Their chocolate chip cookies are also amazing!> My most favorite pasta place in town! Amazing quality for the price. I frequently visit when I carve one. Highly recommend!> This place has been here for quite sometime and the staff and quality of food has been consistent every single time I go.

Fries were fine.The bar itself is not too big. we grabbed a spot near the front at a table and pretty much kept to ourselves. We quickly got our food and pints from the bartender, although most of us barely finished the pints. Nothing was wrong with them, we just couldn't stomach any more beer! Then we all ate in silence as we devoured our food.Thanks for the wind-down to our night!> my first time in Boston and after that 4hours++ bus ride from NYC my sister was starving. this place happens to be located just across our hotel and my sister was craving fries hence we just went it. everything about this place turned out so much better than expected! great ambience! casual, chill, and relaxed. amazing and very pleasant service too! the guy was really amiable and he was attentiveI ordered Portobello Sammy, my sister got the Fourth Wall Grilled Cheese Sandwich and we shared the Lobster and Corn Chowder..- the Lobster Chowder was amazing! it has the most generous pieces of lobster I've ever had in a chowder and the crouton was actually corn bread, which blends really well- both sandwiches came with massive amount of fries. I switched mine to sweet potato fries. Fluffy brioche bun, sharp savory cheese, the portobello has strong acidic taste to it.. Overall it was really good. the sweet potato fries has amazing texture but both fries were kind of bland for unknown reason. there were so much fries we had to pack the leftovers to go. they'll make a good bus ride snack I suppose.for the quality of the food, the size, service, and atmosphere I think they charge decently and was well worth it.. it was overall a very enjoyable lunch> Tried this place out on a weeknight before heading to a show at the Wang Theater. It's a weird mix between a lively bar and restaurant but I appreciate the effort at a nice full menu in a place like this. I had a couple gin and tonics which were quite good and strong. Their menu is limited but has some really nice dinner options. I chose the hanger steak cooked medium. It arrived quickly but was overdone and chewy. The side of street corn was just okay. My partner's meal was also mediocre (burger). Our waiter was exceptionally nice. He was trying his best but it became too busy for him to keep up with tables. It took a while for the second round of drinks. After the meal he initially brought back a bill which was not ours. We waited patiently for him to return the correct bill which charged us for an extra we never had. We sucked it up, paid and got out of there. Overall great people with great intentions. It's just not working yet.> Very good. Went here for lunch today. We got there at the perfect time because it really filled up. I had the burger and a salad. No complaints but the burger could have been cooked a little longer for medium. If you're really picky about your red meat I would have them cook it longer than usual. The sweet potato fries were also a hit! The service was very friendly and the food came out relatively fast. I would definitely stop in here for lunch!> We were looking for a casual spot to get burgers and beers and this spot was perfect. You can expect all the classics of a bar menu. Wound up getting the burger with fries. It is served on a buttered brioche bun - yum! The place is on the smaller side and tends to get packed pretty quickly with the after work crowd on weekdays.","4, 4, 3, 4, 4"

The original Regina's on Thatcher Street has been around since before the Great Depression which speaks volumes to its longevity. It should be your first choice for pizza as well - the romano in the sauce, old-time oven, and homemade sausage all contribute to an amazing combination. To treat ourselves during quarantine, we ordered a Fior Di Latte and Melanzane pizza that was easily accessible through Grubhub delivery. Even with some of the cheese dripping from the Fior pizza, both these pizzas hit the spot. We may do this as a bi-weekly order while we stay in and flatten the curve. Hope you're all staying safe!> I'm usually very generous with my reviews, but I have to be strict when it comes to Pizza. My experience there was 5 Stars, but the Pizza was only 4 stars. The pizza is very full and flavorful, which is a lot of fun. However, they weren't the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust was overcooked and the toppings seemed strewn about on the pizza somewhat carelessly. All that being said, it was very good pizza! And the staff was very friendly and helpful.I was very excited about the #15 (called Saint Augustine, maybe?), a white sauce pizza with sausage and onions. I was very disappointed with the pizza. Looked amazing, tasted less amazing.We also got the Giambotta (#12?) and it was great! Lots of green onions, good classic ""combo pizza"" feel, but original taste.All in all, I'd make sure to consult with the staff about what pizzas to get and they'll steer you in a better direction than we went! Great spot.> In Boston for business and will be here for some time. Finding good places to eat is essential. Pizza was my craving and Yelp searching began.I love tradition and Regina's fit the bill. The ambience of this place is exactly what I love. Nothing fancy. Just great service and food.I had the 10 inch #14 Classico. The dough is outstanding. Lite sauce and great toppings. It was heavy on the artichokes and next time I will try a different pizza.There are many choices and I didn't count all of the them.  Something for everyone. The 10 inch could easily serve 2 people. You can't go wrong at Regina's. I notices a lot of folks ordering simple pizzas with 1 or 2 toppings. The sauce and crust is soooo good, I understand why.If your looking for pizza, stop in at Regina's, you will thank me.> The slice was huge! My personal favorite feature is the thick outer crust. The dough in the center was kept quite thin which made the pizza nearly impossible to pick up without dropping the toppings. I ended up grabbing a fork and knife just to eat it.Despite the mess, it was very delicious. I got a vegetarian pizza loaded with tomato, spinach, and their specialty mozzarella.Paid $7 even for a huge slice of pizza and 20ml Dr. Pepper. I would definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza.> I didn't buy fully into the hype here, but I did really enjoy the pizza. What I found most surprising about the pizza was how unique it was, particularly given the ubiquity of all the sister locations. And its true, the pizza here tastes completely different, mostly due to the oven and the freshness of the ingredients.First of all, the crust is extremely crisp and that extends throughout the entire pie. This is in no way a thin crust pizza - it's thick, charred, and dry with absolutely no flop, but missing a bit of flavor in the dough as a tradeoff. The mozzarella they used was clearly very fresh, but there wasn't much of an aged flavor. Finally, I wasn't personally too keen on the sauce, which was mild in flavor (by design) and has a little kick. With all that combined, the pizza tasted pretty mild overall, but the quality of the ingredients did have a chance to shine. The pizza was closer to a dressed-up casual pie, than a true gourmet outing. I'm not sure it's my favorite in the city (that probably goes to Posto, although the style is very different) and I definitely wouldn't want to wait very long for it, but it was a good pie nonetheless.","5, 4, 5, 4, 4"

The short rib poutine is a must, as are the french toast and burgers. One time I had the fruity pebble pancakes which looks amazing but were a total miss, the cereal glaze or whatever it's called was bland and too thick. Besides that though, everything I've ordered has been great.The vibe is alive and buzzy. Mostly the young professional crowd which is the norm for Southie. Wait times on the weekend can be long, put your name on the list in advance if you can't get a reservation.> I was so excited to try this place out! I had an hour to kill before heading somewhere else in South Boston, so I did some research and decided to meet a friend at Lincoln Tavern. The reviews were so good! And I've already been to Capo a few times, so I wanted to try something new. What a disappointment!My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I got an espresso martini which came out with some kind of powder on top - a lot of it. Have you ever heard of the cinnamon challenge? Not good. I then ordered the margherita pizza and was saddened by the lack of flavor. I mean look at the pic... that's exactly what it tasted like. Bland AF. They didn't even offer chili flakes or parmesan to spice it up. I could have asked, but that leads me to my 2nd gripe...The bartenders seemed nice, but were absent. We got our order in right away, but then I had to ask twice for water. Then, our food came and no one stopped by to ask how the food was or if we needed anything else (like something to give the pizza flavor...). We were done eating when they thought to come by and see if we wanted another drink. No thanks.It was a Wednesday night at 6 PM and the restaurant was full, but not crowded (which it sounds like this place can get later at night and on weekends). Not sure what happened here because the same group owns Capo down the block and they have good food (come to think of it - their pizza was underwhelming too - my bad) and great drinks. How can Capo's espresso martini be wonderful and Lincoln's be so dreadful? Same owners - same block! I don't know. I'd like to give this place another chance. My friend did like his tacos and the brunch reviews are good. If I come back and have a better experience, I'll update my review. Until then ""Meh. I've experienced better"" sounds like the right rating to me.> I want to like Lincoln.The food has been consistently good, to be honest it's one of the best burgers I have had the pleasure of eating. Yet, the good food cannot undo the fact that every time I'm there I am transported to a college frat party. I've gone three times, all at different times of day, and without fail the place is jam packed with people loudly sloshing beer, yelling at the football games, and generally being inconsiderate of other patrons. The most recent time there was no different, except for the fact that the food was mediocre at best while the first two times it was excellent. I had the shortribs on top of a very salty truffle mac n cheese (could not finish it, far too rich) while my fiancee ate a burger that looked almost raw (she ordered it medium). Maybe try going at an off time, lunch on a weekday perhaps. If you want to brave a weekend then if sticky floors and screaming over your food is your thing, by all means go. We'll opt for something else next time.I really do want to like Lincoln, the food is usually great but the atmosphere is so unbearable that it ruins the meal.> Lincoln Tavern was one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to + it was a perfect spot for football Sunday! The food is above average and the bar has a nice vibe - there are TVs everywhere for you to watch the games. Our group loved it!We started with spicy wings and a plain pizza - both were fabulous. Our table got the steak burrito and burgers for entrees - also delicious. They give you huge portions on all the food so be sure to come here hungry!The service was good despite it being extremely packed for the football games. I definitely recommend making a reservation as we did have to wait a half hour for a table. Regardless, it wasn't an issue as the bar was a blast!Next time I'm back in Boston, I certainly will be heading here again! Highly recommend.> Lincoln continues to deliver my favorite brunch! Their hash browns call to me every weekend. It's always crowded so get there early. Get at least one of these when you go:- hash browns- spicy Bloody Mary- wheat toast- fruit bowl. It has a large variety and I don't know where they get their fruit buts it's always fresh, ripe and juicyOne thing I wish they had was fresh cream for the coffee. I appreciate the warm breakfast appetizer berry bread, so yummy!","5, 2, 2, 5, 5"

Cocktails have room for improvement but Il Molo makes up for it with an extensive fantastic wine list.  Is definitely a hidden gem right off the main track of the north end.  A must dine!> I took a group of 13 to IL Molo. We shared 12 dishes and asked to have them served 4 at a time. The first 4 came out barely warm. After complaining the next 8 were nice and hot.The bread we were originally served tasted like it had been sliced long ago as the exposed surfaces were stale. After complaining, we received delicious fresh bread for the rest of the mesl3 of our dishes contained lobster but all I found were the claw tips. When asked, they admitted 2 only had the tips but said that the lobster pie had tail meat but I couldn't find any.The scallops were delicious as well as the spaghetti and clams and lobster pie. The seafood stew was plentiful and tasty except for the tough lobster claw tips. When I have lobster at home, the tips go to my dog. It seems that more and more restaurants only serve claws which leads me to believe they are not cooking whole lobsters but just buying pre-cooked claws which are most likely far less expensive than tails. (This is my hypothesis and not a verified fact for Il Molo.) The service was good and our party overall liked our meals.> The service and food was fantastic. Our server had great recommendations for wine that both my husband and I loved. The mussels were beautiful done with a great broth that made us ask for a second round of bread to sop it up. We then split an order of linguini and clams that was perfectly seasoned with al dente pasta. I would return here in a second!> Such a good italian/seafood destination! Came for dinner to meet up with some friends in the area and was surprised I had never heard of it while living in Boston for 6 years for school. It's a little separated from the rest of the North End and has a slightly more modern and sea-themed feel/decor. Don't let the seashells and starfish fool you though, you still get amazing quality pasta and italian flavors!Prix fixe menu: $32 for 3 courses, and you get a lot of food! I took home leftovers. I had the grilled lamb skewers, the lasagna, and the rum cake (as they were sadly all out of the gelato and the cannoli that night). The lamb was cooked really well, the lasagna was super flavorful and cheesy, and the cake was moist and delicious! Oysters: not pictured, but we went for a selection of 3 total, one of each variety they had that day. They came with lemon, tabasco, and two sauces-one of them was raspberry flavored which was kind of fun!Swordfish: really really good! The cook on the fish was perfect and it had a good crispiness on the outside. Definitely worth it and the quality you would expect with the Boston Harbor basically right outside.> Awesome experience here. Lovely fruity olive oil with crusty bread to start, tasty lobster rangoon with nice chunks of lobster in it, and beautiful main dishes. The only negative was the bar tender- who was not nice. The waitress and hostess were over the top helpful and attentive though. I got the pasta arrabbiata with mussels and octopus, and my friend got a fish dish which had salsa and lobster in top. They make the pasta there and the seafood is extremely fresh.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

The neighborhood was adorable. We had originally planned to walk over from our hotel in back bay, but after a day of exploring Boston it was an easy Uber! We were seated immediately with a reservation and enjoyed the meatballs and bread to start with a lovely bottle of Italian red. The meatballs were amazing! We both agreed the sauce was our favorite thing we ate all weekend! For our entrees I had a pizza and my fiancé got Bolognese. The pizza was pretty good, but I would definitely recommend getting the pasta! The texture was perfect. We shared dessert to end the meal and left full and satisfied. I would highly recommend this if you're wanting to try some Italian food in Boston but don't want to have to stand in line or travel to north end. It was so cozy and exactly what I was looking for!> I want to give 2 stars. Except the food is actually quite good. Had the celery caesar salad (excellent except for the oddly disconcerting texture of super fine breadcrumbs...); burratta crostini (our crostini appeared, potentially burnt...I did sneak a peak at the table beside us - 3 inches away - theirs looked quite delightful/not-burnt), all ingredients other than the actual toast were delightful!; squid ink Bucatini with octopus -  totally delicious, excellent on every level, all flavors, textures, etc sooooooo good; then we had the funghi pizza which included egg, excellent thin/crispy crust, runny egg yolk, needed more salt/heat; chocolate Gelato was perfection; cappuccino also excellent; good cocktails. So why only 3 stars WANTING to be 2 stars?? Their vibe/atmosphere is HEINOUS. Good God. Horrible. Everyone is packed in like sardines. It's a weird/odd/old spot, but whoever came up with this particular ""layout"" probably needs to be slapped. I got elbowed, hard, in the boob, just trying to get to the sad/undersized/un-dusted bathroom because it required I walk behind the bar seating. Whoever is choosing the music?? NEEDS TO BE FIRED. TODAY. Absolutely horrible. Loud, grating, screeching, you have to YELL at your dining companion. Who is 6"" away. Because there is, legit, no actual room in this place. And the thing that REALLY REALLY REALLY turned me entirely off: they are using the absolute cheapest, rock bottom, bad silverware. How do I know?? I own a damn restaurant. In fact, it's a diner. And I would NEVER use such pathetic dining utensils. I'm not paying almost $100 per person to eat with horrible cheap diningware. Which includes the ""side plates"" provided if you are sharing dishes. They're big enough for like one slice of bread...Delicious food. Horribly uncomfortable and awkward dining experience. Horrendous/terrible vibe. Seems to work for them. Place was quite busy. I won't be back.> I went here for my birthday dinner and had an amazing time. The intimate setting was perfect for a date night and transported me into a restaurant like in Italy. We got the charcuterie board which was to die for. The meats were so fresh. We got a specialty pizza that was amazing - cooked from the brick oven. The meatballs were the favorite appetizer of the night. The sauce I meatballs came in  I wish could have taken home just in a jar to cook with. The sauce had a bit of a kick to it which we really enjoyed. Overall great ambiance, wait staff was friendly and delicious food!> Coppa offered one of the best culinary experiences we've had in a long time via their Christmas Eve Feast of the 7 Fishes event.It's a fixed price tasting menu that plays on the Italian tradition and offers paired wines (4 oz) at a super reasonable price. The creativity and execution of this meal/event was flawless and took notes from many different cuisines outside of the standard Italian staples such as Japanese, New England American, and French which added to the overall experience and variety. The wine pairings were as creative as the meal itself and offered varietals and types of wine not typically seen on menus which not only worked very well with the food but also to expand our palette and knowledge of offerings from different regions. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly throughout the whole experience which was what I would expect from an event like this. However, the way the multiple servers rotated throughout the evening was like a well-choreographed dance that had no faults.We were so impressed with the experience we not only decided that 5 stars was appropriate but we made immediate plans to come back and try the standard menu in the next two weeks.> Nice little spot on Shawmut. I took my folks for an easy Sunday night dinner. These are pricey small plates but really solid, quality food. My parents got the celery Caesar with was a bunch of fresh celery and not a salad they expected but they enjoyed. I had the tagliatelle which was amazing. I got one order to go for my wife as well. Looks like a good spot for a nice date night as well.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

Nice place - clean. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with a side of fresh fries. The fries were very fresh and crunchy just the way I like them. The guy who made my wrap did not skimp out on the chicken at all! It was a very fulfilling wrap. It was just a tad bit more dry than I expected even with the extra garlic sauce. Overall, this place is great for a quick bite to eat.> Stay away from the beef.I went here for lunch with some coworkers during peak lunch time. One ordered a falafel wrap and said it was good and moist. One ordered chicken shawarma wrap and like it. The other ordered chicken shawarma plate and loved it.I ordered beef shawarma plate (9.80) and it was absolutely gross except the well seasoned Greek salad.The beef was the ***driest**** beef I've ever had. It was also cold in some areas. Not a single bite of the hot dish was hot. I left 90% of the beef on my plate, since it was actually unpalatable.The fries had zero seasoning. I had to put my own salt on them. Underwhelming.This is disappointing because we went during peak lunch hours. Food should be top quality during this time.The only good thing was the side of Greek salad. I loved it! The staff doesn't call your number on the receipt so it is challenging to get the right plate. I would not go here again, and I would not recommend it.> I'll notch it up a star because Bishop's has decent spinach pie as a side. A couple of them, along with a salad, makes an okay meal.> Delicious food ! Their chicken shawarma is amazing and also their grape leaves are the best !> Nice and clean restaurant for lunch today, they have tables inside and out. I chose the chicken shawarma platter for lunch and it was very good. A couple of small bones in with the chicken but that's to be expected for freshly pulled chicken. It was quite tasty.A good portion of chicken, garlic sauce, hummus and tabouli with a pita on the side. The pickled radishes on the side were a nice bite.

Everything was fantastic. The oysters were fresh and the mussels were tender. The lobster roll was full of flavor and definitely in the top three best lobster rolls I've had in Boston so far. Fries are a weakness of mine and I loved the fries at Black Lamb. They were just the right thickness. But by far the best dish of the night was the lamb tartare with eggplant, fig, and mint. Wow. It might have been the most interesting tartare I've ever had. I was super curious about the combo of ingredients (all so seemingly different from each other) in the tartare when I first saw it on the menu and I'm so happy I tried it.

The atmosphere is nice-but-not-formal (there's a TV behind the bar), with friendly and prompt service, but the culinary experience blows many more buttoned-up restaurants out of the water. Note that they're no longer serving the lamb tartare I saw mentioned online, which was disappointing, but the Wagyu tartare that replaces it is truly excellent. I love having a raw bar with a decent selection of oysters to open up the meal. The duck breast frites were also fantastic - tender, juicy and flavorful.> I love (like, LOVE) Bar Mezzana, so is it any surprise that I love their sister restaurant as well? My friend and I have been indulging lately in little friendship ""date nights"" where we try new places, grab some bites, and DEFINITELY partake in some cocktails.For once in my life, I didn't get a martini. Well, not my traditional Hendrick's martini, at least. I ventured out of my comfort zone for the espresso martini because, hey, they are trendy as hell right now, and I don't always have to fight the crowd. It was absolutely delicious... maybe even too delicious - I had several. We made a reservation, which I recommend. This place gets busy. We had a little two-seater that was dangerously close to our neighbors, but which was surprisingly quiet. I started with some oysters, as always, and finished with the mussels. The mussels were fantastic and came with fresh grilled bread (I only wish I had a little more bread for that broth!). We were enjoying it so much, that after dinner we relocated to the bar for a nightcap (or three) and dessert. We fell in love with the special pie, which was TOFFEE (YASSSSS), and with the corn madeleines. They are baked to order, which worked out because it gave us plenty of time to digest.Our service from start to finish was fantastic. Our server was attentive, plates and glasses were bussed quickly, and the one time I was looking around admiring the decor, the manager immediately came up to make sure I didn't need anything. Once we moved to the bar, we were helped immediately, despite how busy it was. 10/10 on service, guys.Another hit from Chef Colin Lynch, Heather Kennaway Lynch, Jefferson Macklin, Ben Kaplan, and Beverage Director Ryan Lotz. I worship anything you do.> I came here with my sister and cousin for girls night. I was looking forward to it because my cousin had raved about it. The problem was, however, that I'm a sea foodie and not a land foodie. I couldn't not find a pescatarian dish to save my life besides the raw oysters that I enjoyed. My sister attempted to order the lobster roll but they were all out. I attempted to order the branzino and they were all out. There was nothing that interested me and I had worked up an appetite for this place. I was so disappointed. The waitress told me they had one salmon left that they could make with the branzino fixings so my sister settled for the duck and I had the salmon. The salmon was just ok. The only thing I enjoyed here overall was the oysters and the soup I ordered.","5, 1, 5, 5, 2"

I got the Fried Eggplant and Turkey Sandwich with fries. The sandwich itself was surprisingly juicy, considering how dry turkey can be. The fries were seasoned to perfection, fresh, and crunchy. However, I thought the portion of the sides (such as fries and especially the salad) were on the smaller side but considering the affordable price for where Coda is located, I'm not mad at it. The servers were also very friendly, so overall I had a pretty good experience!> Chill and staple restaurant in the South End. Came for their cocktail menu, which seems to have a few new selections periodically (their menu on the website might not be up to date). The cocktails are pretty strong and interesting.The veggie burger was pretty standard and highly stacked, which made it a little hard to eat. The patty was pretty good though. The fries were pretty flavorful and a good surprise.> A simple and comfortable spot in South End. My group of five did not have to wait at all to be seated on a Saturday. The server was very helpful in giving recommendations. Food wise, the deviled eggs were divine: buttery, creamy, and with the right amount of spice. However, the French toast fries did not live up to expectations, because the dipping sauce was entirely melted butter... it would've been much better with cinnamon sugar or maple syrup. The veggie burger was good too! I liked the beets spread in my burger.> Solid food, efficient service, but felt slightly overpriced for the food. I ordered the Mac n cheese as an add on size and that was the best decision of my week. Creamiest homemade Mac n cheese ever. My only regret was not including the bacon renderings in it. Wish I could conjure up that cheesy sauce out of thin air-I was using my hamburger bun to mop up that cheesy sauce, the ""classy"" version of licking your plate. Lamb meatballs was AMAZING. Juicy, not over cooked, not gamey, and delicious. It's hard to make lamb meatballs while making sure it's juicyKey lime pie was delicious and refreshing. Glad to see that they didn't add any green food coloring to the pie. the bright green key lime pies are artificially colored.> Walking back from the Pride Block party, we pass Coda...the people inside seem to be enjoying themselves, so we stop to look at the menu.  Located over a family enjoying their meal, they share that the drinks and the food are great.  Even their little girl seemed happy about Coda.A staff member came outside and shared a menu with us to read and immediately we were hooked.  The staff was great and on top of it with the service.  Answering our food questions and making suggestions.  I like that.The space is great and works for a group of two to maybe 10 with reservations.  But they have table top, high top and bar seating, so you can go wrong.The food was incredible.  We did not diversify with our choices and both had the chicken, which was really, really good!  The combination of the chicken with polenta and kale which the sauce, well...it was the best.  I could have licked the plate...but I have class and did not.The full bar options provided us with choices...and the rum drink (forgot the name) was yummy.What a perfect way to end the most awesome day in Boston.  A relaxing space with great people and incredible food.  Thank you.","4, 3, 4, 4, 5"

The server we had was super nice and the restaurant itself is definitely a pretty loud spot and gave off a lively nighttime hangout spot vibe. We ordered:Kimchi Fried Rice - 9/10 was pretty good and had lots of flavorBeef Tartare - 8/10 the scallion pancakes added a nice addition and was a decent size considering that most of their menu is small platesShadowless Fries - 5/10 these were extremely salty, but was interesting since it included mapo tofuDidn't get any good pictures of the food since it was so dimly lit inside.> Come here with the right expectations and you will be blown away.It's not a quiet date spot and doesn't try to be, music is a lot of rap and hip hop so if that isn't you're thing you may not enjoy it too much.We found a seat at the bar within 10 minutes, All of the food was incredible.Highlights we're definitely the dumplings, kimchi fried rice, chicken wings and the ribs.Chicken sandwich was good but not as amazing as everything else.Cocktails were all perfect...From what I can remember Ordered about 5 rounds.> It all starts with the choices one makes, and when the food  is great, everything adds up well. We got the kimchi fried rice, the shojonator and a grilled chicken in the Bao from the lunch menu. The shojonator never disappoints.Have to come back for their dinner menu!> DINNER REVIEWCame here after an event in their event space upstairs. We had some of the apps and loved them so much that we wanted the full experience. We had to wait 30 minutes or so on a Thursday night but they had pretty fast turnover.This place is dimly-lit and loud but smells amazing from all the food you're surrounded by. If the idea of Asian Fusion Bar Food sounds good to you (like it does to me), then this is the place for you. I think I could have ordered every single thing on the menu but here is what we got:Wu-Tang Tiger Style Ribs - fall of the bone, sticky, sweet, and spicy. These are a must-getKimchi Fried Rice - can't go wrong with fried rice and kimchiKorean Steak Tartar - a delicious tartar with these chewy yet crunchy scallion pancakes to scoop them up withGrilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwich - a little difficult to share but it's stacked high with moist chicken thighs and covered in a fried peanut aioli. Reminds you exactly of kung pao chicken.The portions are much bigger than your average small plates restaurant so 2 each is more than enough. This place has great value for the quality and quantity of food you get.I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu.> Came here on a Saturday night past 10pm and it was pretty packed. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries and a cold brew Vodka tea. Both were decent and for a person who does not really drink, the cold Vodka tea was delicious. I just thought the service could have been better. It took way too long for things to come out, it was hard to track down our waiter and overall the restaurant gave a night scene kinda feel which is fine, but usually in those places, service is hard to get and noise is beyond loud.","4, 5, 5, 5, 3"

They serve home style Italian food. Their portions are enormous. Everything can be shared among at least 2 people or even 3. They offer fresh pasta with variety of different sauces, from marinara to the pesto. At the same time they offer fish and meat dishes. I had their antipasto, Caesar salad and lasagne. Antipasto was refreshing with a light dressing. It's a combination of lettuce, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. Nice way to start a meal with a glass of wine and antipasto. The lasagna was tasty too. We paired everything with a nice bottle of wine. Their wine list is pretty big. Most selection is Italian and American. Their wine prices are very decent and wine matches the style of the food they serve. The restaurant itself has a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Lots of wood, quite music on the background, view of a wine cellar.  Good place to have a couple dinner or small gathering.> I've been to La Famiglia's several times before and I've always been happy with the food and especially the portion size, which is HUGE (think 3 meals worth). This time, I was really blown away - the food was better than I remembered. I think there is a disparity because I ordered the specials this time, as opposed to X pasta with X sauce. There were four of us and we split three entrees and one salad. We ended up taking leftovers.Al's Favorite - I definitely recommend. It came with chicken, broccoli, gnocchi, and vodka sauce. This was the favorite of the night.Tortellini with chicken and pesto sauce - Also a favorite of the night. The pesto was very creamy.Lasagna with bolognese - this was definitely good lasagna with creamy filling, but it was the least favorite, simply because the specials were excellent.Caprese salad - fresh and delicious with soft mozzarella.They also serve bread and dipping oil at the  start of the meal. Overall, they have delicious food and very reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. We went at 6pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 mins.> ""Help me! I think I've fallen in love again!""...With this Warm cozy spot found on Salem st... For a quick minute, I died and ended up in my Nana's kitchen ... Service was attentive right from the start. Made a reservation and showed up a little early and they sat us early. Water and bread hit the table less than a minute after we did. Waitstaff extremely intelligent and gracious, offering excellent suggestions at every instance. (This differs from some previous experiences  I've had in the north end). Wine offering was very good and the price points accessible. But the food ... the food is why we go... and it is the best I have had in the north end. (Period))And I've conservatively tried at least 30 restaurants over the years, and La Famiglia exceeds every experience I've had based on quality and quantity of their dishes and the speed and attentiveness of service. Easily 5 stars Buon Appetito!!> This was a great late lunch, I'm a lucky lady my partner invited me out for fruitti de mare, a full plate of your choice of pasta penne or linguini in either white sauce-olive oil, garlic, etc., or house red, or a fresh tomato.  I picked house red, terrific with penne.  The dish came with a generous amount of calamari, mussels, and little necks.  Did I mention they have a luncheon menu, but we really came for the great frutti de mare on the regular dinner menu a larger portion than luncheon menu.  My partner insisted we get the dinner size, not a problem.  The shellfish was very fresh, pasta cooked perfect.  The marinara was delicious.   The place was busy with many out for lunch.   It is cozy and I love the fireplace and the way this place is tucked into the building. The bread is fresh and warm with a bit of hot in the olive oil dipping sauce.  We could have gotten one plate and shared but my other likes eating big!We will be back, we bring our visitors here always a memorable dinner or lunch.> Great place to gather and be welcomed as if one of the family..!La Famiglia Giorgio, located down a narrow side street on the Northside, smack dab in little Italy.  Seriously, as we walked around with google leading the way we felt like we were transplanted to another time and place.   Love the location.  Very quaint.  Parking can be a little challenging. Recommended by our knowledgeable Bostonian friends, we knew we were in for a treat.  At 5pm we were quoted a wait of an hour for a party of eight.  When the last person of our group arrived and checked in with the host about 5 minutes later we were taken right in.  So nice to know a relation of the Godfather.  From a tiny bar downstairs with a few tables we were ushered upstairs which opened up to a rather roomy dining room full of life and noise.  Everyone talking, singing, having a great time!The service was quick, efficient, jovial.  The food was, well it was in MASSIVE proportions!   Our friend who recommended Giorgio's was most familiar with the huuge menu so we happily left the ordering to him.  Had a sampling of antipasti salad, chicken parmigiana, large meatballs, clams...what didn't we have?!!? Unfortunately three of us forgot to tell him we were doing low/no carbs so you can imagine the infinite amount of leftovers!  Lol.  All delicious.Thank you Larry and Judy, thank you Cindy and the Godfather's nephew for a most memorable evening!","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Menu contains a lot of smaller plates that are good for sharing and a few entree sized dishes. MUST TRY: Smoked mussel toast - creamy pumpkin, sage, garlic aioli on top of toasted sourdough - perfect combo of flavors and texture! I will go back just for this dish (maybe 2 orders of it!)Good:Ceviche - fresh fish with lime and chili on top of a crispy tortilla - light and refreshing. Paired well with my glass of rose.Mooncusser Chowder - a lighter bodied chowder filled with different varieties of seafood (reminded me of a delicious chowder I've had many years ago in Manhattan beach, CA).80 Thoreau Burger - simple but very satisfying... the patty was very tender and juicy and the Thoreau sauce (not exactly sure what's in it) was very flavorful.We also tried the deviled eggs and fish taco (portion is pretty big). They were fine, but nothing special - would skip next time!> Drinks and food were okay, a bit on the pricier side. Service was okay as well. I ordered a cup of their clam chowder and found it to be a too watery, although the clams were a nice texture.the flavor. Overall It was more of a soup than a chowder. Not really worth going out of your way for but if you're nearby not a bad option. Maybe I'll have to try the food at Mooncusser upstairs to really judge the business.> All dishes were on par.  Lobster roll was bland, needed strong mayo and some acid, lemon.  Bun was doughy, not enough butter or any.  $28 is not cheap for not super fresh lobster such as spots like belle isle with lobster tanks.  Grilled squid was good.  Oysters nice.Chowder watery.  Ross's grenache perfectly chilledFries a bit greasy, onion rings too skinny.> Great place for a date night! There's a large and affordable selection of wines and beers, so you're bound to find something you love. I opted for a rose and left in a happy daze! If you're a seafood lover, there's LOTS on the menu to choose from. We ordered the bluefish pate, the tartare, and the fish tacos. All were super tasty, but the tacos were DEFINITELY the winner. Highly highly recommend the tacos! The fish itself was super flavorful and had a nice flaky, layered texture. And the beer batter that coated it all was PERFECT for a super satisfying crunch. The accompanying slaw, pickles, and sauce tied everything together nicely to create a bomb taco! Overall, it was a super satisfying meal and a great spot to drink and munch on some yummy seafoody dishes!> So. Amazing. Although I didn't check yelp (fail) and my bf did when recommending Moon Bar, we were a little surprised initially that they didn't have a full bar license - only beer and wine! We were looking forward to a nice cocktail bar BUT you guys - this place is a GEM. The service was great - I think the owner or manager was taking our order and he was such a nice guy! I ordered rose and my SO ordered a beer - the best rose I have had, very high quality. For the food, we got the ceviche, smoked mussel toast and the fish tacos. First off the ceviche was AMAZING and we love crunchy foods so the tortilla on the bottom was a great touch. The next, which we can't decide what we loved more - was the mussels toast. Amazing smoked flavor and I can probably eat 23 more. Lastly, the tacos did not disappoint either. The fish seemed great quality, the garnishments were cilantro, jalapeños, onions and limes. Delicious. Please visit. Then again, don't. I want to keep this one for myself. We will be back soon!","4, 3, 3, 4, 5"

The space inside is pretty cramped and loud.The service was decent - it bothered us that as soon as we stopped eating, our waiter took everything away (even the hot sauce!) without asking if we were done. At that point we were still debating going for another round of tacos but we obviously overstayed our welcome.> Puro knocks it out on (or rather, a few steps below) Newbury for cool vibes and great eats. The blah: our party of two had to wait longer than we would've wanted on a Wednesday night... when we arrived at 7:30 PM, we were told it would be 15-20 min and ended up waiting about 45 until we were seated at the bar. But the server was super apologetic, which made it seem like this isn't an everyday occurence.The yum: cocktails! I got the tequila mule which was limey and spicy, with fresh slices of jalapeños in the glass. My friend enjoyed her passionfruit drink which came with a strawberry on the side.For dinner, we shared the ceviche mixto, the chicken tacos, and the corn pancakes. I would definitely order the ceviche and pancakes again! The chicken in the tacos was too greasy for my taste, and the flavors of the sauce and pineapple salsa didn't really come through. It was also kind of messy to eat, and the soft tortilla got soggy quickly. But the ceviche - oh my! Fish, octopus, and shrimp were served up in a delish sauce with avocado and plantain chips. It was a great portion for sharing too! And the corn pancakes - yummo! The two cakes are slightly sweet and have cheese in between them as well as a sauce and more cheese on top. They're deliciously different.The small space is dimly lit and has cool hip sweet street art-like paintings on the walls. Come with a small group, early if you can, or plan to wait. But it's worth it. And the menu is large, so there will always be more to try. Puro ceviche vida!> Such a unique and fun hidden gem on  Newbury street. It's a really small spot with dim lighting, fun music, no more then 7 tables. Tip: they don't take reservations so make sure to get there early The food was delicious too. They had many vegetarian options that were delicious. Our table split the guacamole, Mexican style corn, and peppers for apps. Then we all got tacos for our main meal. I got the portobello mushroom tacos and they were delicious. For drinks I had the tequila mule and it was the perfect amount of spicy. I would definitely recommend it. After the meal we had churros for dessert and they were so good.> Good food, good attitude and down from earth,  literally. If you're vegetarian or pescatarian you will die for this venue.  After good falafels and good Levantine lamb, fresh ceviche is my third favorite food. Puro knows how to make a good tuna ceviche very well. They know also how to grill a bronzino. And for sure they know how to make the perfect pisto manchego.  Pisto is the Spanish equivalent of ratatouille. And who doesn't love a good warm Pisto. It's a vegan delicious dish topped with quail eggs and queso manchego. They have few tables but every time we walk in here, we get seated right away. Waitresses are so pleasant. Get the Pisto. Get tuna ceviche. Get grilled fish. Next time would try paella. They have brunch over the weekends.","5, 5, 3, 4, 5"

This South End restaurant isn't too big so make reservations beforehand. There is a bar with plenty of seats if you want to risk it without reservations. For food we ordered (ranked starting with most favorite):Crispy Eggplant - oh so delicious! This reminded me of the Zuchinni chips they serve at their sister restaurant Kava but better! Make sure to eat every bite with the yogurt and honey sauce. Musakhan - this roasted chicken dish was a whole chicken served on top of a flatbread. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. Pikilia - this included the manakish flatbread with 3 dips, wish there was more flatbread because we had leftover dip! Shrimp Aliyyeh - well cooked and flavorful shrimpFalafel - crispy falafel served with small pieces of flatbread in a make your own wrap kinda style, no complaints hereBeef Shish Kabab - this came with two kababs, good but nothing specialRoasted Cauliflower - the yogurt sauce made this dish very heavy, wasn't my favorite but others enjoyed itShort Rib Special of the night - this was a skillet of short rib, potatoes, and cheese. It was very homey and comfort food but didn't stand out among the other dished. DrinksI tried the Putnam Manhattan and Passion Martini. Drinks were delicious. Try the passion martini if you want something sweet.Overall this was a great dinner experience. Service was kind and did not rush us at all. I will definitely be back for the crispy eggplant!> In all honesty, if I was only reviewing the food, this place would get 5 stars. Unfortunately, the service was so bad, I'm struggling to give it 4 stars. First things first, the food was incredible. There was not a single bad dish on our table- we tried the crispy eggplant (probably the favorite of our table), halloumi, octopus, shish barak (really tasty, lamb-filled pasta), kibbeh, mejadra, imeruli khachapuri (delicious) and lamb chops. Everything was delicious!Now for the service- our waiter didn't even come over to our table for 30 minutes, and then took our drink order. He came back around quite a while later asking us to order. There was no introduction to the menu, recommendation on how many dishes to order/portion sizes, and no explanations for the many different dishes that we were unfamiliar with. I think it's safe to assume that most people aren't familiar with shish barak or other, similar options on the menu. At one point, I actually asked another waiter if he had recommendations since ours was neither forthcoming nor helpful. He just couldn't be bothered to do anything but write down our order. Lastly, he brought over the check and placed it on the table without asking if anyone wanted another drink or dessert (which apparently they do serve, he just didn't offer it to us). I'm not sure if I would come back based upon our experience.> Went there for brunch yesterday with my mom. You cannot order off the regular menu for brunch. We both got the Sabich which was a sandwich that was bland and forgettable. For $12 I thought it should have come with a side. The interior is lovely and the service was friendly, would avoid brunch in the future and give dinner a try.> Same owners as Kava, enough said! I have yet to try their bum run here but their dinner is second to none!","4, 4, 4, 4, 3"

I personally like the steak in cola one. There are other good options as well.3. Branding: the pizza boxes I think are actually flipped upside down so they can print their own name out there.

The atmosphere is really unique with festive art work on the walls and a skull with real roses on every table. Just the atmosphere itself makes it fun. The drinks are so delicious. The food is amazing! I have the zucchini fritter taco and it was the best taco I have had in a while. This place is 5 starts for their drinks, food and atmosphere no doubt. Lastly a cherry on top they are very vegetarian friendly.> Really nice decor around the restaurant , an amazing entrance view of the seaport before you walk in.  We were seated quick and with a friendly server. To my surprise they do not have High chairs for our baby, I guess they don't expect anybody to have kids... it's not a club or a loud bar, where's the fkin baby seats?!The server offered us free flavored ice to start, she was excited to tell us that it was complimentary even know it's probably about 5 cents worth of flavoring, gee thanks. The food is quite overpriced. It tasted excellent and comes out very quick, but to fill yourself up may set you back around 40$.  All servers are instructed to tell customers from the start that the entrees are small. Their rate for one small taco is 7$.Our bill for two people ended up being 100$ , It was a nice experience but a bit overpriced .> I went to Lolita's with some coworkers after a long day and enjoyed the experience.The atmosphere was colorful with plenty of skulls, roses, red chandeliers and art if a bit loud for my taste.The presentation of the food from the grapefruit sorbet served in a dry ice induced fog with a tasteful uncharged dose of House brand tequila to the bright red ""broken heart"" margarita was on point and added a experiential element to the visit you usually don't get from restaurants when attending.The service was good and the area was clean and well maintained.The food was excellent and the portions not ridiculously over sized. My habanero chicken tacos were both hand sized, soft, and delicious.The groups favorite app was easily the avocado toast. I highly recommend it. The cauliflower fritters had a nice pop of flavor and spice, possibly aioli? As well.The churros were the best I've ever had. Long, cloud like. Not smothered in powdered sugar or filled with caramel. Just good on their own merit and served with a rich chocolate dipping sauce.The margaritas we had included the spicy cucumber, the Lolita, and the broken heart. The favorite was the spicy cucumber and the least favorite was the broken heart which was reportedly too sugary. All of them seemed to contain too much ice and water and not enough tequila.The final touch was a temporary tattoo (branding genius for free advertising) and pop rock cotton candy with our bill. The bluish cloud was a nice finisher for the night.I'd return and the only thing I'd do differently is try some of their other drinks as I didn't care for their margaritas.> I was here with a friend eating the churros. After having one, I said: ""there's the fifth star!"". I visited the Back Bay location a little while ago, and my expectations were set at that solid four-star level. It was a couple of moments of awesomeness and deliciousness (like the Churros) that awarded the coveted five-star medal.You have to start with the awesome flavored ice with a generous, complimentary, splash of tequila. What makes it 'totally' awesome is that the dry ice in the base causes a whole bunch of vapor to rise in a plume to be beheld when a server brings it over. To start with my friend and I had the Mexican Fried Rice appetizer. Dude... this blew me away. Think pork fried rice from your favorite Asian place, multiplied by five, just without the grease. All the flavors within came together splendidly with just the right amount of flair, and freshness, also especially fond of the cheeses. Now, if you're a fan of tuna tartare, definitely do not miss the Tuna Maracuyá! The tuna was of excellent quality with added ingredients to spruce it up, but not so many that the tuna becomes overwhelmed. My only critique here is that a couple of bites were heavy on the acid. On the other hand, the blue corn tortillas are a wonderful compliment! For tacos, we tried the Mahi Mahi and Al Pastor. If I give them points for anything, it's for this: the tortillas were excellent and better yet, they did not skimp on the meat! This comes as a double-edged sword though when you have this much protein relative to tortilla (and others), it takes away from the balance and makes it a bit tougher to handle. Still, the protein quality was on-point and the additional ingredients were great too, they just need a little more room to shine!Of course, who could forget the churros! Before these, a churro was a dry and cold sweet stick. Now, I realize that a churro can be a take on fried dough. There was crispness outside and fluffy softness inside. To borrow from Chris D., they nailed it. Sure, they were a little oily, but what's unhealthy tastes good, just the way life is! Cotton candy was pretty standard as far as cotton candy goes, then again, like the steaming flavored ice, it's just fun, and did I mentioned free.I passed on the booze this time, opting instead for a tamarind soda. The complete opposite of what I was expecting. I thought this would be a sweet, bubbly drink with a hint of tang that costs $8 for some unforeseen reason. The reality is that it is a little more complex than that, and quite heavy on the tang, a little too heavy for my taste, the slight level of sweetness was on point, though. Finally, the service! Even though it was busy, food came out hot, fast, fresh, and our water glasses never emptied. They have that part of the operation down pat! Yes, it's a little expensive here, value, however, lies not only in the food but the experience, and dining here is just that. The vibe, presentation, service, and of course the food make it worth it if you consider the experience holistically. In a sentence, if you just want some decent tacos, there are cheaper options, if you want a memorable night out, look no further.","4, 5, 3, 4, 5"

I highly recommend. Also, having eaten here several more times now, something to keep in mind-- the sauces and flavors in the specialty dishes are quite intense and can overwhelm the palate after a few bites. Might consider asking for amount of sauce to be lighter.> Little Pecan recently opened in Brighton Center and boy what a treat! They advertise themselves as being a Latin/Asian fusion restaurant as well as offering a fresh smoothie and tea bar.We have been twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner. We have done both takeout and dine in. For dinner, we ordered take out. I got their pad thai while my partner got the blood orange stir fry. The pad thai is not like traditional pad thai but is very sweet and includes candied pecans. Truly SO good. The blood orange stir fry was very fresh with chunks of blood orange and a delicious sauce to go with the rice. Not a huge portion, but certainly worth it's low under $10 price tag.For breakfast we dined in. I got the Farmer's Hand sandwich which is grilled sourdough bursting with bacon, a fried egg, avocado, arugula, griddled tomatoes, and a citrus aioli. It was so amazing and the flavors worked together. My partner got the carnitas hash which had huge chunks of carnitas and fingerling potatoes. They serve their free water with ice and adorable paper straws. The business itself is small but clean. They have changing LED lights, beautiful bathrooms, and cozy booths/benches to hanker down in to relax. Service was friendly and although we didn't order it, the coffee comes in very cute cups.Almost everything on the menu is vegetarian, although some dishes have meat or you can add meat in. Also, everything seemed to be under $10 which is great for Brighton. Again, not huge portions, but still a good value for your money. This will be my new go to spot for dining in the area.> Loved the banana foster pancakes and farm hand sandwich. The bananas were sweet and slightly crispy. The maple cinnamon butter was heavenly but I love butter so?> The zucchini noodle arrabbiata was wonderful. It was cooked perfectly. The 'zoodles' were thick and I loved the fresh taste of the vegetables. I'm in awe of this dish because I've never had it taste as good from other restaurants, and even my own zoodle recipes are nowhere near matched in quality. This place is very conveniently located near me so I'm anticipating more orders and looking forward to what else they have to offer.> Whoa. Brighton Center has a new king, and its name is Little Pecan Bistro. I don't always prefer the cute hipstery newcomers to the charming old time hole in the walls, but it's undeniable that Little Pecan is just devastatingly delicious. What is of particular note is the way they do certain American favorites better than most of the surrounding businesses. Both their steak and cheese sandwich and their fried chicken sandwich are among the best versions of either I've ever had, and competition for those two sandwich types is fairly strong throughout that two block radius. Luscious, colorful, dripping with flavor, served with fresh home made French fries. And the staff is very friendly and kind! Little Pecan has swiftly leapfrogged over the competition to become my favorite lunch joint in Brighton, which is no easy feat. My wife and I even felt that the food was stronger than that of some of the (notably delicious) high-end dinner places in the area, too!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"
Kaze Shabu Shabu,Boston,4.0,2,Yes,Yes,No,kazeshabu.com,"Japanese, Hot Pot",11:30 am - 2:00 am,11:30 am - 2:00 am,11:30 am - 2:00 am,11:30 am - 2:00 am,11:30 am - 1:00 am,11:30 am - 1:00 am,11:30 am - 2:00 am,Null,Null,"Kaze Shabu Shabu is their name, but there's a poster outside advertising their lunch specials consisting of Bibimbap (Korean mixed rice bowl) and Ramen (Japanese soup noodle) served daily till 3pm.  This tempted me because it has been rather hot this summer so far, and I'm not much one for Shabu Shabu (cooking your own food in a hot pot of soup) when it is this hot.Note that Kaze does not open until 12 noon on Sundays, 11:30am every other day.  There's two bubble tea places down the block.By 12:30pm, their first floor was full up, and we had all been served our main dishes, as the Bibimbaps came with both miso soup and ice cream, while the Ramen came with ice cream.  All that for $9.50! ($10.50 if we had gone with the eel variant)The clay pot arrived super hot and without a verbal warning.  But we were all experienced enough to know better than to touch the pot.  I gave my egg a flip to start the raw side cooking against the pot, then shortly realized it would be best to give my rice a nice scooping as well, since I prefer my scorched rice a golden crisp sans the burned black.  The beef, though shaved too thin, was well flavored.  The portion fully consumed, and well satisfied.A DC commented that the ramen noodles were too soft, but the egg was very well done and nicely flavored.Ice cream was a simple scoop of vanilla.  A nice end to a tasty meal.  (On another visit, it was strawberry.  The similarity was that there was no choice offered.)For those electing hot pot, I thought it great fun that the condiments to make the sauce was provided on a well contained trolley.We'll be back.  They also offer hot pot lunch specials, starting at $10 for beef, lamb, pork, or chicken breast, while topping out at $15.50 prime rib eye. $15.75 seafood deluxe, and $33 beef lover, and all the items you could want to add for a la carte pricing.Note: 18% gratuity was automatically included for our party of 8.***I did return on a cooler day for one of their hot pot lunch combos.  It was $10 for either lamb or beef, so I opted for the lamb and traded slices with a DC to try the beef.  Both were thin cut and tender and tasty, so can't go wrong either way!I played it simple and selected their included meat bullion and tossed in some scallions and fried garlic from their sauce cart.  It sufficed.  But I did sample a DC's $5.95 Pork Compact Bone Marrow w/Tomatoes & Sweet Corns soup base (aka Big Pork Bone Soup) and found it a nice rich alternative.  When sharing a burner with another, the broth arrived in a large divided pot.  However, for my own private burner at the other end of the table I was provided with a smaller pot containing my single soup base.  It was larger than those individual settings set bar side at other establishments, and so could hold everything I decided to toss in at the first go without running out of space nor cooling down overly much.Unlike the flip side of the lunch menu, the hot pot combos do not come with dessert (a refreshing scoop of ice cream).  Instead, the meat selected is accompanied by a bowl of assorted vegetables (namely greens, carrot, turnip, mushroom, and corn), and a choice of noodles (Japanese Potato, Mung Bean, Udon, Spinach, Vermicelli) or rice.Neither lamb nor beef take long to cook, so just a few swishes till the color changed over, and it was ready to eat.  Veggies were not quite as simple, as the root vegetables and mushroom should be tossed in first for a longer hot bath.  Noodles soak up some of the broth, so I threw those in close to the end of my meal.I ate all the meat and leafy greens, but some of the noodles and other vegetables made it home with me for a snack.> Being in Boston for so long I've actually never tried this hot pot place in Chinatown. I've always gone to either Q, Happy Lamb and most recently Liuyishou. And I think there is a reason why I have not gone and I probably won't go back any time soon.To sum it up the experience is just average. Nothing really memorable. The meat served to us was frozen and have bloody spot on it. Clearly it hasn't been prepared properly. The decor and color of the restaurant seems old. We were sat near the entrance and we can feel the wind chill still. And price is like around 35 a person after all which isn't cheaper than other places either. If you want to try it just to see what it is feel free to do so. But I wouldn't recommend for going more often than that. There is a lot of room for them to improve in order to compete with other hot pot places in Chinatown.> I wanted to like it because I had been craving hot pot. And I thought it was acceptable. Until about halfway through the hot pot sesh, when I took a bite of the century egg in my cilantro + century egg broth. It was rancid. I immediately spat it out and tried to go forward with the broth because that technically tasted fine, but then decided it was not worth continuing to consume if the eggs were bad. I told our server and he said that there shouldn't be anything wrong with the eggs even when I described the terrible taste. While he asked if we wanted to change the broth, he didn't apologize or offer to replace the food that was in that ruined pot. Other than that, the portions were really small. We got one of the seafood combo platters, which comprised 2-3 pieces each of several low-quality seafood items and eight slices of beef. That was about $26. And then I got a serving of four house-made fishballs because those tend to be delicious--but not these. Not only did these cost $7, but they also were not even good.> My mother taught me that if I had nothing nice to say, I shouldn't say anything at all. For this review I want to really focus on the great 5-star service received from the waitress, unfortunately I didn't get her name. I will not talk about the flat Kirin beer received and despite 3 different bottles the beer was just flat. I will not talk about the overly oily and over-fried appetitizers I went to eat instead of the hotpot, which I totally regret.I didn't read the Yelp reviews prior to going,  and if I did I would only order the hotpot.> Am I the only one who think this place is mediocre? Majority of my friends like it but I don't. Okay, servers are fast and friendly. Area is clean for most of the time. Food is expensive and okay. Mostly frozen in my opinion. Alcohol beverages are usually watery. Barely any parking in the area (but I expect it for Chinatown). Just eh. I mean, are they better than Hot Pot Buffet on the other street? Yeah. Better food quality. At least it better be. However, there are so many other options that I don't care about this place. It's usually my last choice and only if there's long waits at the other restaurants.","4, 4, 3, 3, 3"

There's so much flavor in their soup. Kaju is always my favorite in Boston! I love ordering their combo with galbi. You can't go wrong with their meat options. I usually go to their allston one but this one is bigger and was closer to the station. (Kenmore green Line) Their sides changes once in a while. They don't charge for the sides. Don't be greedy but they do refill. This time I also tried the Hot Stone Bulgogi Noodle Soup, which was on the sweeter side, not bad but was expecting udon, but came with the glass clear noodles. Prob would stick with the Tofu Soup next time instead.> Good food for reasonable price.  I'm a big fan of the portions here.  We went on a Sunday, and apparently they open at 11, but the door and Google say 10.  Please be aware of this error.  The sauce on the Galbi was fairly good, and the Dukbokki was good as well.  I think compared to other tofu places in Boston, Kaju stacks up well.> Kaju is one of my favorite places for soondubu. Classic stop for a hearty bowl of Korean tofu soup! Although I usually go to the Allston location, the food here tasted just as good.My favorite is usually the combo with the Tofu Soup + Pork Belly but I just ordered the kimchi and beef soup ($13.99) this time and would rate it a 9/10. It was a little more on the salty side but nonetheless, still tasted good if you ate it with the rice that comes with it. You get a choice of either white rice or nutritious rice. The soup is mostly made up of tofu with bits of kimchi and small beef pieces as well as an egg. They also provide a series of different banchan (side dishes) which weren't the best and seemed a little stale. They also don't offer free refills and its $1 extra charge :(Overall, the place is clean and service is friendly. Food is good and the price is quite reasonable as well. It has a bit more seating than the Allston location so there's usually very little to no wait. If you're looking for a quicker meal, I would come to the Kenmore location. Would definitely recommend coming here if you're craving a bowl of good soondubu!> One of my favorite Korean restaurants in Boston! I am always happy with the consistency of the food. Great place to visit on a cold day for their tofu soups. Their hot stone bibimbap is also to die for. Excellent service! Highly recommended!> Really good tofu soup here! I asked for spicy and it was just the right amount of spice! The beef was very tender and well flavored too. Reasonable prices, fast service. Would definitely come again!","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"
Chef Tan,Boston,4.0,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Chinese,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,"We tried out several dishes today. The spicy stew duck and steamed pork ribs were my favorite. The duck was dealt properly so that there was no gamy taste at all. The steamed pork ribs were spicy and greasy. They were cooked in the classic way. To be short, these dishes were authentic! Foreigners may not like these. However, as an ""authentic"" person, I love them.I hope they can keep the food quality, reasonable prices and portions.> Bubor Cha Cha has been one of my favorite childhood Cantonese spots so I was dismayed to see it revamp itself, (for a third time), but I'm happy to report that Chef Tan/Bubor Cha Cha is a welcome Hunan addition to the neighborhood!We got a stir-fry beef with chili dish on the recommendation of our waitress, as well as the pork fat fried rice. The beef was very flavorful but also very spicy, (even coming from someone who adores spicy food), where the heat built with each bite. I can confirm that is an authentic Hunan restaurant, and was packed with Chinese patrons and others waiting for a table on a Saturday night!The beef was a touch too spicy for us, so it was great to cool off our mouths with the pork fat rice, which wasn't spicy at all but incredibly oily. Even so, I would order it again because of how unique and delicious it was.The interior is very modern with a lot of dark wooden accents and updated furniture. Service is very eager to help you decide what to order and our waters were often refilled. It was a little hard to flag a wait staff down for boxes and the check, but they're still working on operations during their early stages. I know I'll definitely be back to try more dishes.(I hope they just rename Bubor Cha Cha as Chef Tan because of the plates pictured here and it feels like a whole new restaurant. But the new sign at the front still says Bubor Cha Cha.)> Chef Tan just opened earlier this week in the center of Chinatown and I had the pleasure of going there twice now to see how it is. And honestly, I think this is probably the most authentic Hunan cuisine in Boston with its variety of dishes and distinct flavor. Of course, there can be some improvements, but for a newly opened restaurant this is as good as it gets.Not sure how to translate all the food pictures I attached to English, but you ought to try the corn as well as the bamboo shoots with bacon (萝卜干炒腊肉) Also a must rice dish is the pork fat rice (猪油拌饭), a Hunan specialty. The special duck blood dish (韭菜鸭血) may not be for everyone but it was certainly fresh and tasted great! I also got complimentary sweet on Valentine's Day, a Hunan special sticky bun (糖油粑粑) What could improve is the 全家福 dish. The soup was slightly bland and the ingredients added in the dish is not what I usually see in Hunan. The service is exceptional and they are very receptive to my feedback. The waiter/owner also said the chefs are hired from Hunan so it's definitely authentic local dishes. Definitely worth a try to experience this new restaurant!> Was really excited walking in because the restaurant smelled great! We ordered grandma's steam spare ribs, spicy green beans, braised pork ribs, beef fried rice, rice with pork oil, and corn. The spare ribs and green beans arrived very quickly but our fried rice and pork rice arrived 10-15 minutes after so our meat was cold by the time the rice came. The corn also arrived extremely late after we finished eating and about 5 mins before we called for the check. Multiple servers came to our table with the wrong orders and seemed lost and confused. But this is something to be expected in a new restaurant. The flavors were very good! Individually the dishes all stood out (with the exception of the corn, that was very bland). The food was spicy but not too spicy. However together, the entire course was quite salty. I would not recommend the pork oil rice if you're ordering other very flavorful/salty foods. Overall the food was good, the service needs improvement and I need a lot more water.> I came here the day that it opened, the food was really good and the service is great! We got the fried rice balls with sesame and the pork is fatty and tender, and the spicy green beans, they were a little too spicy. Although the food is not cheap, it's worth it. But my only complaint is almost all the food is spicy and I'm not a spicy food fan. But overall the food is great.","5, 4, 4, 3, 5"

We both built our own bowls, creating exactly what we wanted.We both got brown rice, chicken, and veggies.The rice was delicious as was the chicken, which was seasoned with cinnamon and other spices. I added lettuce, olives, and a yogurt sauce to my bowl. I expected the sauce to be more like a tzaziki, but it was super thin and watery and lacked flavor.My boyfriend added hummus and tabbouleh to his (which is what I should have done!)The hummus was delicious and the tabbouleh was thicker than most (less grainy and more stuck together - in a good way) which I really enjoyed.I definitely will order from here again, but would build my bowl differently.Brown rice, chicken, and veggies are delicious, as are the hummus and tabbouleh - that is the bowl to get.> Tried the spicy Adana kabab, which was hardly like anything an actual Adana kabab tastes like. The rice which came with it was plain and no flavor in it.They have no clue as to what actual Mediterranean cuisine tastes like, the spicy Adana kabab was the worst Mediterranean food I've had in the Boston area.Went there after seeing good ratings on Yelp, but I am pretty convinced now that Yelp ratings are often misleading and hardly valuable, This place hardly deserves even a single star for the quality of food they are serving> I really wish I could give this place a good review but it sucks when they cheat you on their delivery. Consistently incomplete orders, missing. When you order a bowl you expect the food to look like what is advertised however it is horrible! Look at the picture attached to this review. I purchased the salad separately for my set and that was missing items as well. How can you mess up a salad If you are the owner of this place, your employees are ripping off your customers!!! Fix this soon or all your customers are not going to come back> I don't ever write review for restaurants I haven't eaten at, but I i walked in this place and walked back out. It was dinner time on a Saturday and there  was only one other customer here unlike the other pretty busy places on the corner. We stood there for a few minutes and were not greeted. The lights were dim and dingy. The place smelled like dirty water. And the prices were increased from what I had  seen on yelp. So we left.> I've had Dates & Olives twice now and it's definitely a solid spot in the Brighton/BC area!Located on Chestnut Hill Ave, it's a small shop with a few tables and a bar where all of the fresh food is prepared. Both times we've gone it hasn't been crowded, but since the food is made fresh it does take some time to prepare.The food is clearly fresh. It's kind of like Chipotle where you build your own meal. You start with a base, pick a protein, 3 toppings, and 1 sauce. I've also ordered just the falafel on the side and although a little dry, it was still good and freshly prepared. However, the bowls are where it's at.For the base I chose a salad bowl and added moroccan chicken. Again, it was very fresh and delicious. I had mine with the carrot raisin salad, feta cheese, and babaganouj. For the sauce I went with tzatziki - you can't go wrong with the tzatiki.  The bowl was fresh, delcious, and the flavors worked together wonderfully. I also love having the option to choose everything that goes on my salad. I found the portion to be a little on the small side (I have a big appetite) but it was priced fairly at $9. It's a little further from my house than I would like, but I would definitely eat there again if I were in the area!","5, 1, 1, 2, 4"

from the same restaurant twice in one week. India Quality restaurant might be the exception. I enjoyed it so much that the other options on their menu really kindle my culinary interest - specifically towards this Indian cuisine journey I've been on lately. All of which I ordered was finely prepared and seasoned wonderfully. Plus the portions are generous. Oh and plus there are dietary labels on their menu items online, like vegan and gluten free; very helpful and considerate. All of these positive attributes including the fact my order was ready on time makes me want to return very soon.> Previous review still stands. We ordered through DoorDash again. Food was fine. In response to the owner's comment to my initial review--I disagree with you. Tipping is not required by law. If you read the entirety of my review, you can see that I have tipped very well and have tipped zero as well. Do NOT cherry-pick the one instance of ""zero"" tipping as justification or lack thereof. There's a whole discussion on this elsewhere you can find. Of course, if you're interested, I am more than happy to open discussions for others to comment.> This place is centrally located in Kenmore and easy to find. It's in a busy area so you can go elsewhere to find things to do after dinner if you wanted to.I rarely eat Indian food so I was a bit cautious about what to order so I went with the chicken korma, which was incredible. It was a decent amount of food and filled me up. Service was decent as well.> I placed a delivery order -- I was really looking forward to the samosas but they were very undercooked. I bit into them and I could see and taste the uncooked dough.> India quality is getting me through college. Super tasty food at a good price. I probably eat here 3 times a week. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!","5, 4, 4, 4, 2"

Our first time around we almost left - the door is unmarked - but I'm glad we didn't. This is a place straight out of my Indiana childhood (where Poles and eastern Europeans were plentiful). All the food is homemade. From scratch. It's essentially the kitchen of the Lithuanian cultural organization,  and feels a bit like being in a very friendly VFW. The president of the club came over to greet us and to make sure we felt at home. The regulars were sitting by the bar watching the Pats game.  We had the stuffed cabbage and the kielbasa dinner. The borscht soup at the beginning was absolutely delicious.  The evening and the meal were perfect in every way.> Great place!!! Everything was soooo delicious!!! You definitely need to try traditional Lithuanian - Cepelinai!> The staff and other patrons were super-friendly, the food was homemade and wonderful, and the place has a very simple, yet comfortable atmosphere. The stuffed cabbage was hearty and accompanied by great sides, the borscht was served hot. I want to go back and try other dishes.> If you like Lithuanian food, you're gonna love this place. And if you don't like Lithuanian food, you're still going to love this place. And if you don't know what Lithuanian food is, you're going to love this place.> Amazing food. Some of the best flavors if you like Lithuanian (or Polish, or Russian - some overlapping geography over time in that region). Most of the conversation around me in the restaurant was in Lithuanian. Cold borscht and potato pie were among my favorite dishes on the menu. Service is limited as it is one waitress for the whole place, but the food is well worth the wait. Almost like Mama's, but so delicious and Mama didn't have to do all the work (or the dishes)!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

There is a 10-15 minute grace period for you to make your reservations so aim to get there on time.To be honest, most of the drinks that I've enjoyed here were just unique concoctions the bartender mixed up by request. I like fruity cocktails, tart sours, or something like a French 75, so they're usually around that flavor profile.> My friend and I have this thing where we take turns choosing the place to hang out. It was my turn, and initial thought was ""boring"", so we decided to get some Greek/Mediterranean instead.To start, they bring out some warm pita and veggie hummus. The pita was warm and the hummus was mild yet flavorful with just the right amount of oiliness. Both tasted fresh and homemade, and weren't over-the-top, but still a notch or two (or three) above store-bought.Okra Horiatiki was alright. A pretty basic salad with a little flair. The dressing, if any, wasn't overdone eiither. My suggestions for improvement: I did find there was a little too much feta, and the okra crisps, while a nice touch, were out of sync with the salad. It may be a good idea to have the strips be smaller, if not integrated in the salad.Bao was an interesting experience. Overall, the Baos was more in line with baos found in Asian restaurants, with just a little greek flair by way of the slaw and sauce. Because they were advertised as ""gyro"" I expected the meat to be a little closer to the meat you shave off those large rotisserie machines. My gripe is that the meat wanted it to stick together, so biting into the gyro, the rest of the meat followed, leaving me with mostly steamed bun and some slaw/sauce. These flairs of slaw and sauce were nice, but didn't put too big a dent in the flavor. Having a little more crunch would be appreciated. Great Scott! cocktail was an interesting mixture, but all the additions didn't really shine through. Reading about the brown-butter washed whiskey, Cynar, vanilla, saline, creole and chocolate bitters I expected something out of this world. Instead, I got what was just a really solid old-fashioned.Dessert-wise, Galaktobourekakia (think baklava only with custard) didn't really do it for me. On the plus side, the dough was amazingly flaky, and the custard was tasty. On the minus the balances were off, and it seemed heavy on the custard for something intended as an interpretation of a baklava. Where this place shines though, is the service. Not only was it the usual ""quick and polite"" I write so often, but exceedingly attentive. When I needed to find my server, and another saw me looking around, they came over and offered their help. Teamwork... it makes the dream work, because the dream without food... well... is less tasty.> Came on a Sunday morning for brunch. Great ambiance, modern decor, a little loud, perfect for groups. Service is kind of slow, we waited over 30 minutes for our waiter to take the order, and ended up flagging down a random (but helpful) waiter. The food was underwhelming in terms of selection and taste (not bad, but not something to return for), so combined with meh service and higher prices, this place is a three stars for me. Ordered:- Trio of Dips: yummy, but we ended up ordering too much, and in hindsight, should have omitted this. - Greek Pancakes (half stack): great texture on the pancakes, but personally the greek yogurt threw me off. I kept expecting it to be whipped cream so the yogurt tang was a surprise every bite. A half stack is still MASSIVE, so don't underestimate this. - Shakshouka: not the best shakshouka I've ever had, but decent. The eggs were cooked well-done, and the flavor overall was weak. Drinks: - Red Ruby Sipper: true to name, nice to sip on and tasty. - Disco Juice: STRONG. One of my favorites was their complimentary bread with fig jam -- delicious. Unfortunately they don't sell the jam separately for take home.> Solid brunch spot in the seaport area. The place was busy when we showed up, but for a party of 3, they did have seating in the communal table area. They offer solid cocktails. The bloody mary was one of the most delicious that I ever tasted. The mix tasted fresh and wasn't overly salty or spicy. The zucchini crisps were like a healthy version of potato chips. The burger that I had was a juicy mess, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I told my fiancee that we definitely need to come back for their dinner offerings.> Organized a birthday brunch here for my friend. They are able to accommodate large groups in advance, we had 12 people. Our server Jordan was phenomenal and friendly.  They even allowed us to bring an outside cake in and sliced it for us without a fee which I've seen elsewhere.  The restaurant is a bit loud as we heard a continuous stream of top 40 hits so may not be the best place for a quiet outing. While not listed on the menu, they do serve both mimosas and bloody Mary's for brunch. My mimosa was $8.  They do have a cocktail menu as well. I take away a star since the food is not always up to par. My Greek omelette was pretty bland and overcooked.","5, 4, 3, 4, 4"

While we were heading in, we overheard customers who were leaving saying they had some great food. We took this as a good sign and they didn't disappoint!We both wanted to try the limited tonkotsu but they had ran out last week since they were booming with business due to a convention. We both ended up having the Chat-Cha ramen which was very good. I personally really want to try the tonkotsu as that's my favorite broth-type, but food was still very good. Boyfriend ordered the large (looks are deceiving - it looks like a regular but i think they pack more noodles). He usually finishes food without any issues but he kinda struggled to finish the whole thing; best believe he did finish it though. I ordered the regular and only got halfway through since there's so much food haha. BF and I both were surprised by how clean and nice the bathroom was too  and he also liked that they didn't add gratuity automatically onto the bill (this is a plus and makes him want to tip more haha). Overall, this is a spot we're adding for our next trip to Boston and we need to try the tonkotsu!!!> There's a lot of solid to good ramen restaurants in Boston right now, and I feel like the only reason you might want to come to Amateras right now is if you particularly enjoy testing your spice tolerance (check their miso and green monster ramens) or you have a vegetarian friend craving ramen (check their vegetarian miso). Maybe part of the reason I feel this way is because the Chat-Cha Shoyu ramen I got made me feel a little bloated/uncomfortable afterwards. While the ramen itself tasted fine (I wouldn't say anything stood out except for whatever sauce they poured over the bean sprouts being delicious), I probably should have known better than to get a ramen that was so fatty-filled. I was considering the green monster and the yuzu shio ramen but decided to get the Chat-Cha because I wanted to see how their chashu tasted. What a mistake.I certainly wouldn't mind coming back in the future to try those other ramens or maybe even their maze soba. Overall I think Amateras is a solid ramen restaurant. But right now, I would put Isshindo, Oisa, and Snappy Ramen above this restaurant in terms of ramen quality.> Another favorite ramen place to add to my list - it's a small list for Boston area so this was so exciting that I have found another one! I've had this place several times and have tried about five of their ramens and all five have been delicious! The noodles are cooked nicely but it's the broth that I was most focused on and the broth, no matter which ones, of the ones I've tried, were all delicious! You can taste the flavor without it being overly salty - I always drink the bowl dry! But  beware of their spice levels, spicy is pretty spicy! If you're super hungry, I'll recommend the Char-Cha Shoyu Ramen; comes with lots of toppings and pork and that drizzle of pork fat is a delicious touch. If you want something a little 'lighter' then the Yokohama Tonkotsu would be my go-to. It's the standard pork broth - so good! For a more fiery experience, the 'green monster' would be my recommendation but again, their spicy is spicy.. second base was what I went with so I can enjoy it without having my tongue to be on fire ha!The lunch hour rush here is crazy expect a wait - so I usually stop by on the weekend to avoid the work hour rush. Fast and friendly service!> BEST VEGGIE RAMEN EVERI have always had trouble finding a place for vegetarian ramen but this IS THE PLACE. I got the spicy veggie miso with an extra egg and extra mushrooms. I always leave feeling super full and the miso soup is so flavorful. You will not be disappointed! The service was great, and very fast.> I was so excited to finally try Amateras and they absolutely delivered in meeting all of my expectations! I obviously will never shy away from a spice challenge so I went for the Miso Ramen - starting at 5X spicy. Just the first level of spice. I'm definitely going to work my way up the ladder to 10X & 20X if I surivive I'm bound for that Fujiyama Jumper Miso Ramen seasoned with carolina reaper.The 5X Spicy felt pretty mild to me but the broth was well-balanced and the texture was not too thick or too oily - and the noodles were perfect in terms of chewiness. Cooked just right. I got the Maze Meshi Don to accompany my ramen. All the fixings in the Maze Soba but paired with a bowl of rice. It was a refreshing bite between slurps and noodles. Makes me want to give the Maze Soba twirl if I can ever say no to ramen.Amateras definitely is up there on my list of favorite Boston ramen joints.","5, 3, 5, 5, 5"

The menu includes traditional American dishes as well as some latin American style foods eg tacos, heuvos ranchosMy wife had paramount breakfast 2 eggs ham potatoes and toast. I had the caramel and banana french toast with 2 eggs sunny side up. Cafe mocha latte and hot chocolate 4 stars because drinks were a bit warm, hotter would have been better. Potatoes were a bit salty. Otherwise great meal> The Paramount is a cool spot few steps from the street between Boston Common and Boston Public Garden. I remember passing by this place many times in the past few years but never sat down to have a meal. I've been here on a busy Sunday and for a late lunch on a Saturday with a totally different experience in terms of crowdedness and loudness. For the Sunday brunch, I had to wait approximately 60 minutes in line just so I could order something but seating after that took less than 30 seconds which is how their system works. Unfortunately, they forgot my order, so I had to wait for another 10-15 minutes after paying up. Saturday lunch was a breeze with not a single person in line so I could walk in straight and order directly. Received my order few minutes after being seated.Coming to the food:Banana & Nutella Waffle with SausageIt's a single large waffle topped with chopped banana and strawberry slices and finally garnished with Nutella. Since it came out fresh, the waffle had a perfect balance of being soft and crispy. Although the waffle-fruit combo was not overly sweet, I went with sausage as my side and palette cleanser along with iced coffee.Roasted Turkey Panini with Fresh FruitsAlthough the panini was not huge, it was filling for sure. They packed in half an avocado inside which I wasn't expecting. I can say the taste is more on the bland side which worked for me but for others who like their sandwiches to have more spices, I would recommend throwing in some chilli sauce or salt. Many people go with fries as the side with this but I went with a bowl of fresh fruits which is contrasting to the panini's flavor. The bowl had slices of pineapple, blueberries, strawberry and banana.Overall it's a value for money restaurant if you want to grab some good breakfast, brunch or lunch in the historic Beacon Hill area. I wouldn't recommend this to people who don't like to wait for Sunday brunches or breakfasts since the wait time can be easily 45-60 minutes. The staff is courteous and active in managing and serving all the patrons but sometimes the sheer volume of people inside it beyond capacity. Would definitely like to come back and try some other interesting items on their menu like their pancakes and omelettes.> Tried this Boston Diner for breakfast. We heard it gets busy but we didn't have any wait arriving at 9:25am. We ordered a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich, Blue Berry Pancakes, Chocolate chip Pancakes and had to try the Boston Cream pancakes. All the food was ready shortly after we ordered. The Bacon, Egg & Cheese sandwich was pretty straightforward (nothing special). The hits were the fluffy and moist pancakes!  All of the Pancakes were pretty large portions. The Boston Cream pancakes tasted as well as it looked. They are definitely worth a try if you are into Pancakes for breakfast!> Amazing!!! Best gluten free waffles I have ever had. My significant other said that his hue is rancheros were delicious as well! The line was out the door but it went so fast. I was in awe how efficient they were! By the time you are done ordering they have a seat for you. Go for the delicious food, but not if you plan on leisurely enjoying your breakfast!> The quality of the food and service at Paramount is amazing particularly considering the price point.  The cafeteria line format actually makes for a very efficient ordering and seating.  Their menu is a nice selection of Mexican favorites such as huevos rancheros and American classics like waffles.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, especially the line cooks who take the orders and are always smiling and willing to give recommendations.","4, 4, 4, 5, 4"

Between Addis Red Sea and Asmara, I like Lucy's for their flavors (tend to be less salty than the others), though their meat combos are less exciting diversity-wise than those at the other restaurants. Portions are good, we asked for more injera on the side - 5 cut rolls like the ones positioned around the plate - and it was $2. Other restaurants have it included.I've been here once before and liked it enough to come back! This time we got the meat combo which is lean beef ""chunks"" (honestly there must be a better way to describe this) which we asked to be spicy. It came with some stewed tomatoes and a couple pieces of raw jalapeño on top. The spice level was ok to me, nothing that noticeable but just a mild bite. The combo also comes with four veggie sides. We got two sides that he recommended to be spicy (honestly did not notice) and chose another two random ones. They were sautéed spinach dishes and spiced lentil dishes - both pretty good but I have no idea which was which! Overall nice experience. I wish service was a bit faster since the restaurant was so small and that there were more types of meat in the combo, but the food was great and I would definitely come again. We were in and out in about an hour and made it to the symphony on time (would definitely recommend as a dinner spot before the show!)> We ordered Lunch Combo for two -  Beef.  Beef is on hard side, Veggie is not hot, potato is hard in core and I think it is not fully cooked.  Not a great first experience to try something new.  The smoothie tastes different which is fine.  I do not think we will come back again.> Our first time eating here was in 2015 when we were stationed in Connecticut. We made a trip to Boston to check out the aquarium and some breweries, and stopped here for lunch. That meal was very good, with super fast service, punchy, flavorful food, and really decadent drinks.Once we got orders back to New England, we made another trip to Boston and made sure we could revisit Lucy's. While we were gone between visits, we were stationed in Hawaii and had truly superb Ethiopian food in Honolulu, which spoiled us.On arrival to the restaurant, we knew something was different. The music had changed, the food tasted a lot more bland, and despite being only one of two couples in the whole restaurant, the service was poor.We ordered the exact same thing we had back in 2015 to try and compare, but felt honestly pretty disappointed in how flavorless the lentils were, how soggy the teff pancake was, and how bland the telba flax drink was compared to last time. It's sad because their food really was so good, I wonder what happened...> Best Ethiopian I've had in a while. The service was extremely friendly and prompt. The place was really cool- with artwork for sale, how to say basiwords in the language up on the board, and cool items- like from the traditional coffee making ritual. We shared a dish for 3- which came with nicely cooked chunks of beef in a savory sauce, and all the veggie sides. My favorites were the ones with potato. The bread is like a sponge for the sauce, and has its own cool, tangy, flavor. Would love to come back for breakfast or dessert!","5, 4, 4, 2, 4"

This has a retro cool modern look and vibe to it. Long bar on one end and tables on the other. Its not very big but definitely feels super cosy and warm. Came here with a friend who is a regular here and highly recommended it to us. And Audubon did not disappoint! The hubs and I shared 3 tacos between us - the fish taco, chicken taco, and the chorizo taco. Quite filling and all were really tasty! The server was very friendly too - of course it helped that our friend knows all the servers, bartenders and the owners!! Will definitely be back soon :)> Really like the vibe and service here but was overall underwhelmed by their brunch. My Bloody Mary was great but I ordered something that was their take on Toad in the Hole with Avocado spread on top and some greens - and my egg was overcooked which is pretty crucial for this dish. Was looking forward to sopping up that tasty yolk with the bread. My fiance's huevos rancheros was better. They serve carnitas, salsa verde sunny up egg (his egg was perfect), black bean & bacon purée, potatoes in a pan with the corn tortillas on the side.I'm definitely interested in coming back for some cocktails and small bites (maybe dinner) but Audubon is off my list for brunch.> 4 stars - great staff! I've been here before, but this review is for my most recent visit on Monday night. I had time to kill before heading to the Red Sox game, so I asked to be seated outside on the patio. The waitress actually moved me over a table so she could clean off some bird poop. Welp! Outside means creatures!I ordered a glass of rose and settled in to my kindle, my phone and the tv they had playing so pre-Sox coverage. I was thinking about getting the mac and cheese (they have special mac nights), but I wanted it with burger which would have almost doubled the price (from $9 plain to $17 w/ burger)! I found out from the waitress that the chef puts a whole burger on top, so that makes sense. I went with the poke bowl instead. They give you a lot of fish and it was quite tasty. The one hiccup was that the rice was crunchy on my first go-round. I asked the waitress if that was on purpose and she was like Nope! So, she whisked it away and got me a brand new bowl with a new batch of rice. I liked that the bowl came with some slices of avocado. Yum!After a 2nd glass of rose, I was ready for the check. The prices were what you would expect ($10 for the wine and $16 for the poke bowl). No complaints there. On another night, I would normally be at the bar grabbing cocktails from their great bartenders, but it felt like a ""rose on the patio"" sort of day. This is a great place to stop if you're in the area and it doesn't get quite as crowded as other places close to Fenway.> We found this restaurant on yelp. We had a party of six, and it was seafood fest or something that had all the restaurants booked. We were a little nervous because this one was open, but it had good reviews so we gave it a try. It's nice place. Well appointed. Interestingly spacious, with an open kitchen.  The bar is a great size. They do not have alcohol on the wall behind the bar, which made the place look clean and orderly. It was an odd observation, as I have not seen this before, but it looked good. We ordered some appetizers, all were absolutely delicious. I had an excellent salad. My friend had the bolognese. Although she liked it, I thought it was a little salty. The rest of the crew had the steak. The mushrooms were amazing!!!  The steak was good.  The drinks were very unique and quite good. We ordered two dirty martinis, and I would be surprised if there was any olive juice in them, and they were too strong. Although we did not send them back, I'm sure they would have fixed them if we did. The staff was attentive and friendly. The overall consensus was that the restaurant was great/excellent and the crew was happy and satisfied!> I ordered Audubon for delivery late at night when I just needed a salad but everything was closed. I ordered the kale salad which was... not what I got at all? The listed salad was two kinds of kale, shallots, asparagus, portobello, parm, and balsamic, which I added shrimp to. I received a salad of arugula, quinoa, golden beets, peas, carrots, almonds, radishes, and goat cheese. It's a good thing I actually enjoyed the salad (and that I'm not allergic to nuts...) it was just weird because it wasn't even close. I'm assuming the menu had changed and was never updated on delivery apps, so they just substituted with a random salad. Weird, but the salad was very good and I'm not sure if it's the fault of the restaurant or the delivery app. Only thing I didn't like was the dressing, which kind of tasted the way a spa product smells, so I didn't dress my salad. My boyfriend ordered the burger with cheese, avocado, and bacon, which came with roasted potatoes. The potatoes were great as was the burger, juicy thick and flavorful. True rating would be around a 3.5, sometimes I wish halves were an option on yelp!","5, 3, 4, 4, 3"

Solid wine list as well.Dishes tried:- Polpo/octopus appetizer (5 stars, best dish)- artichoke carpaccio with black truffles appetizer (4.5 stars)- oyster appetizer (4 stars, too many items added, hid true oyster flavor. Still solid dish)- branzino entree (4.5 stars. Cooked perfectly! Simple and tasty)- scallops entree (4.5 stars. Great flavors, slightly small portion with only 4 scallops)- filet mignon entree (5 stars. Cooked to absolute perfection - medium rare)- broccoli rabe side dish (4.5 stars)- mushrooms side dish (3.5 stars, tasted all garlic)- bombardino/ Italian donuts dessert (4.5 stars. Super fresh, still warm and light)Would rate 4.5 if I could, but closer to 5 than 4 due to  prime service.> I came here on a Friday night according to my friend's recommendation. We had Foi Gras and oysters for our appetizers. The Foi Gras came with fruits on the side. The fruits perfectly neutralized the oily taste. In addition, the raw oysters came with lots of ingredients. The fishy taste was completely avoided by the sour taste of lemon juice and the bitter taste of the ingredient. As for the main course, I highly recommend the veal. This course was not like normal veal dishes which come with a side. This course used mashed potato as the sauce at the base which completely enhanced the soft taste of the veal. I ordered a Japanese whiskey for my dessert. The best thing for it was that they used a perfect rounded ice ball inside the drink so the drink didn't get diluted swiftly.> Review #1040One of the best meals I've had in Boston! My friend and I got to try these dishes:- Salmon tartare $27- MACCHERONCELLI (Feather Brook Farms meatballs, Montepulciano sauce, Parmigiano) $20 as an appetizer- FILET MIGNON* - Greater Omaha, Nebraska (8 ounce, beech mushrooms, pearl onions, whipped potatoes, Montepulciano sauce) $44- RIBEYE* Greater Omaha, Nebraska (prime, 14 oz, king trumpets, broccolini, bone marrow, and garlic vin cotto) $48I liked the salmon tartare a lot! My filet mignon was a little too dry, even as I asked for a medium. The meatballs were good, but both my friend and I felt like it tasted a bit funny for some reason? We also enjoyed the molten chocolate cake, which was a solid dessert choice.I love the decor and the table set up on the inside. For once, I don't feel like I am so crammed sitting at a Boston restaurant or continuously have to make ways for waiters to get by the aisle. My server was friendly but as always (as I said in an earlier review), in my limited experience at high-end restaurants, I don't believe I've encountered anyone yet where I was like okay this person entirely deserves a 20% tip. In fact, it is always these family-run businesses where I'd feel welcomed and be willing to tip 20% wholeheartedly.Their bathrooms are unisex and located by their entrance. They are clean and have both paper towels and hand dryers available. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here. Next time, I'd definitely order the ribeye!> Whether you're having oysters and cocktails at the bar or dining experience at a table, you will be no less than impressed by Sorrelina. The service is professional and top notch. I will personally vouch that Sorellina has some of the best oysters in Boston - convince me otherwise. Every meal I've ever had has been incredible and doesn't taste mass produced like some restaurants. If you're taking someone here they will not be disappointed and you will look like you have great taste. Perfect for dates, probably too intimate for coworkers UPDATE:I just had dinner at Sorrelina tonight and am really disappointed by my experience. While the food remains amazing, our server lowered our dining experience. He told us about the ravioli special but failed to mention that it included mushrooms. When I ordered it, I was surprised by the mushrooms and the fact that he never even asked if we had allergies or dietary preferences. He also didn't come back once during the meal to see if we were enjoying it. It wasn't busy at all when we were there so I'm curious as to why he slipped up or if the overall service has gone down. I'd like to come back to see if this was a one off experience but I'm nervous to waste a dinner out again.> I honestly expected a lot more based on reviews. The food was great, but portions were extremely small. I ordered the cod fish, which was good but could have had more flavor. The menu stated it also came with lobster and gnocchi. There was probably 1 bite of each on my plate. However, I tried the lobster gnocchi main dish was tasty. Apps I enjoyed were the tuna tartare and salmon tartare. I didn't enjoy the wasabi on the tuna tartare though as I am not a fan. The burrata was alright, nothing special. We also ordered the eggplant side dish which was decent. Truffle fries were pretty good too! For dessert, we ordered the cioccolato, bombolini, and gelato and sorbet. I loved the cioccolato. It melted in my mouth. We also ordered ice wine which was delicious! It was sweet with an amazing flavor to it. It was pretty pricey at $35 per glass but I'd say it was worth every penny! Service was absolutely impeccable. Great place for a business dinner or dinner for a special occasion. Just make sure you order enough apps and sides due to the extremely small portions!","5, 5, 5, 3, 5"

Place is very small and intimate so you probably will need a reservation to go here.We had an 8:45 reservation and I was running late but my boyfriend got there about 10 mins early and they sat him down.DJ was one of our waiters and he was very pleasant and constantly checked on us. They were other waiters that checked on us as well so the staff is very attentive.I ordered the crab ravioli for the starter and that was so good! It has small pieces of asparagus that was cooked just the way I like it. Amazing flavors. For my main dish, I got the shrimp scampi. It was a hefty serving! Great flavors as well. Definitely took the rest home lolDessert was the Panna Cotta which was decent .. really sweet in my opinion. My boyfriend had the calamari, veal and melted chocolate cake and he enjoyed his meal! I will definitely come back here for a meal - completely satisfied with my experience.> Came here last Friday for dinner with the bf. On the basement level, this Beacon Hill spot feels romantic yet hole-in-the-wall and serves up a delicious range of Italian specialties. Service was above and beyond. Upon arrival, a staff member took our coats. Plus, our waiter checked up on us frequently. We originally came here for their 3 courses for $38 deal (recommended by our cooking class instructor), but ended up opting for entrees. I got the Fra Diavolo which was spicy, tomatoey, had perfectly al dente pasta, and was topped with a moderate portion of steamed lobster. My bf got the Carne (beef tenderloin) which came more rare than expected (but delicious). It came with grilled asparagus and irresistibly garlicky creamy risotto. It's hard to believe that each of our meals was in the $26-28 range! We finished off the night with a capucinno and small latte.Grotto nails it. Come here if you're looking for a fine dining experience that feels authentic and unpretentious.> My boyfriend and I wanted a nice, romantic dinner during our stay in Boston. We picked Grotto because of its high reviews and quaint atmosphere, and it seemed like a perfect date spot. We arrived and found that the restaurant is dramatically smaller than it appears in photos, which makes for an intimate atmosphere, particularly if a loud couple is sitting adjacent to you -- a couple we were practically on top of. In addition, every conversation seemed to echo around the room, so if you're looking for a comfortable atmosphere, it's not here. We asked to move to a different table due to the fact that we on top of another couple talking at the top of their lungs. After we moved and got situated, we opted for the prix fixe menu (appetizer, entrée, dessert). After we gave our waitress the order, she must have disappeared into a portal in the back room, as she was gone for a long period of time. To say that the service in this restaurant is slow is like saying the Pacific Ocean is big. Accurate but also a gross understatement. A glacier could recede, melt, form a river that stretches to Boston, flood the restaurant, and that would have been faster than refilling our water glasses.The food, itself, was ... average. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I ordered the appetizer with the bruschetta, the shrimp scampi, and the pana cotta dessert. My boyfriend got the calamari, spaghetti and meatballs, and melted chocolate cake. The restaurant brought out a dish of olive oil and bread to start after some centuries had passed since we made our initial order. There must have been a mixup in the kitchen because the bread we were served was essentially room temperature Wonderbread with an Italian moustache. Olive Garden would have been vastly superior. The rest of the meal was eh. When we finally got our check, we noticed immediately that we were charged the price of each item ordered as opposed to a prix fixe price. The couple next to us also experienced the same issue and was charged for wine they never received. When the same waitress returned with a new check for them, they discovered that it had not been remediated at all! We're very disappointed because for the cost of the meal, we did not get what we paid for ...Dining at Grotto is an experience in patience.> The interior is a lot nicer than it's exterior.  Perfect romantic date spot with nice classical/jazz music and candle lit lighting.  However, I expected the food to be a whole lot better.  To start, we had the Calamari.  We expected fried calamari, but it ended up being grilled.  SO much better.  My friends and I were very pleasantly surprised and scraped the sauce clean.  5/5 recommend for appetizers.Bolognese:  4/5.  Not bad.  The best pasta dish we had on the table.  The meat tasted really gamey -- maybe they didn't use the freshest ingredients?  Pretty mediocre.Gnudi: 3/5.  My friend enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special or great.Scampi: 3/5.  Very fishy tasting.  It was so fishy that it left a bad taste in my mouth for a while after small bites. They're pretty generous with the shrimp though.All in all, the servings are large and the ambiance is nice.  Not in my top picks for Italian restaurants.> Really enjoyable dine out Boston experience here at Grotto. Came with a friend for lunch and had their 2 course menu for $20. Their regular menu, however, is not too expensive and I believe they do offer a price fixe menu regularly. Ambiance is nice, a break from the construction and other happenings right outside the door. The restaurant is down a set of stairs from the sidewalk, so is easy to miss. I ordered the ensalata mare- white bean paste, grilled calamari, arugula, and lemon vinaigrette- and it was delicious. My friend had the cavatelle as her appetizer- ricotta pasta, sausage, peas, mushrooms, and pancetta in a cream sauce- which was also great. For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi and she ordered the risotto. The gnocchi was prepared with short ribs, mushrooms, and Gorgonzola and was so so delicious. The risotto was huge, the majority of it went into a to-go container (it is a much more excessive amount after eating another pasta dish).I would definitely return to grotto, especially considering that it is still reasonable outside of the deal given by dine out Boston.","5, 5, 3, 3, 5"

It's a Cuban inspired restaurant with Caribbean food as well. There is a parking garage across from the restaurant and they validate parking. We were greeted when we entered quickly and seated. There were only patrons at the bar and 1 other table so pretty light at the time we came. Despite this it took our server a bit to get to us. I'm not sure what he was doing, maybe on a break. After maybe 10 minutes he delivered waters to our table and told us about specials. We both ordered the flight of mojitos and what I originally ordered I was later told they didn't have anymore. The server came back twice after a lengthy period to tell me that what I wanted wasn't available. He was apologetic enough but the restaurant didn't comp me in any way for the inconvenience or extra wait.My meal was good enough. I enjoyed the flight the most. Not sure I'd go back unless I could guarantee a seat at the bar for better service. The bartender was real nice and helped us with other drinks we ordered.> My review will begin with saying the Ambiance is very nice and accommodating. Parking was no problem and validated which was nice since we were not from the area.  I've visited many Cuban  spots as you can see on my page, however this one wasn't my favorite but wasn't totally the worst! (Keeping reading )I began with the yuca frita and ajo. Unfortunately the yuca was very tough as if it was previously frozen. The mojo or ajo sauce that it came with was also pretty blande (thank you Jesus for salt)  For my Dinner  i had the bistec encebollado (steak w/onions) as a side white rice and beans. Steak was not cooked  the way I liked it. I asked for  well done and got medium rare.The MOJITO however was delicious and had a little kick! My friends had Chicken which was on the dry side. Another had the Lobster now that was AMAZING! Have the LOBSTER! The other person had the Fish which was Ok. Plátano Maduros were delish. Tostones were a fail!The place had its pros and cons but worth another shot next time I'm in the area.> The restaurant is nice little spot with the Cuban mural in the hall and a front clip of a classic car. The food was good have to say I asked for medium and actually got a medium cooked steak which a great start. The dish wasn't to die for I'd probably get something different if I were to go there again. For the (pregnant) Wife; said the virgin pina cola was great, thick and rich flavor which is a plus. So over all why a two star I'm being generous here luckily the food was overall good for the price and we were have a good time between friends and family; our waiter wasn't very friendly and our party felt rushed and at the end of our meal just right after we paid the waiter said are you guys done we have another party at 8:30pm.> Very spacious and convenient spot near the Boston Medical Center area. The menu is huge and they have a number of small plates and large entrees. It looks fairly traditional. I came with a large party for a work lunch and didn't want something too heavy so I ordered a garlic shrimp and toast. It was fairly unremarkable. The bread tasted storebought and didn't have much flavor. There were a 5-6 shrimp that were sitting in a salty, garlicky, buttery sauce, but the flavor was a little flat and the garlic tasted like the prepackaged/jar type.> I came here per a Cuban friend's rec so I came knowing it would probably be more authentic. However, to my disliking, the Ropa Vieja's meat was rather salty and almost didn't finish it. The cost of the dishes compared to how much of it was given was also not congruent. I felt that instead of $20, it could have been placed at a lower price. As for now, I intend to try more Cuban restaurants in the city.","4, 3, 2, 3, 3"

I've been here a few times for dinner here and there as a quick decision since there's never a wait, regardless of if I'm with one other person or as a group.The service has always been attentive and friendly and we never have to wait long for our food. When I came last night, our waitress noticed our side dishes were running low before I even did and refilled them, which I thought was really nice. The food itself is good enough for Haju being the only Korean place in this area so I can't really complain.> I actually stop going here after their management changed few years back. My friend worked here for summer and he invited me to have dinner with me so I was like, why not? It is a free meal. We ordered tteokbokki, fried chicken with soy garlic, bibim bap and french fries. Contrary to my disbelief about this place, the dishes here weren't bad at all.Next week or so, I decided to bring another friend of mine to try pout cheese donkatsu, as it is hard to find the place that serves this dish in Boston. They surprised me again, and this was the best dontkatsu I had so far in Boston.I recommend getting fried stuff here, that's where they are specialized in cooking I feel like. I tried different kinds of rice dishes was disappointed  those so I do not recommend ordering those. Please try cheese dontkatsu here, it's really good. (But they only serve it during lunch time tho, I don't know why)> Pretty satisfactory spot for Korean comfort food! I came in solo on a Sunday night after spending all day at Tatte across the street. I ordered beef soondubu (medium spicy) which comes with rice and a little bit of banchan. Banchan selection was small but I asked for a side of kimchi and an egg to put in my soup and they brought it for me free of charge! The meat was beef chuck instead of the thinly sliced beef which is what I'm typically used to but it didn't really change the flavor of the soup. It wasn't the best I've had but it satisfied the cravings! If I'm ever in the Berklee area again I'll probably drop by to try the other stuff on their menu. They have a wide assortment of Korean dishes from fried chicken to tteokbokki to BBQ to all the different soups Service was friendly and fast and the place wasn't that crowded despite it being dinner time on a weekend!> I really wanted to try Budae Jjigae (army stew) and I decided to try this place since they had a deal! I chose set 2 that included the buda jjigae (2 steam rice included), seafood pancake, a choice of sides (coleslaw, steamed rice, or french fries) and 2 sodas for around $30! Food:Banchan - There wasn't much banchans. I liked the fishcake more than the onions.Budae Jjigae (army stew) - It was okay. It felt like it was missing or lacking some toppings. But it was pretty filling in the end from the other items in the set. Seafood pancake - It was good and there was a good amount of toppings!Fries - They were super fresh and hot, so it was good.They forgot to give us our sodas, but thats fine! We were really full in the end and had to take leftovers home.Overall: It is a good place to go to if you are craving Korean food with good deals!> The food was decent for walking distance within the area if you're craving for something Korean. We got the Set 1 ($25.95) which comes with Tteokbokki and we chose the Small Chicken Bites Mild.Tteokbokki: 3/10Barely anything besides just cheese and mushy dumplings...Chicken Bites: 10/10Crispiest and yummiest chicken I've ever had, these were so good! If you get Mild, it's basically just Crispy Chicken with the addition of a 'mild' sauce that comes on the side.Overall, the food wasn't amazing but service was friendly! Place is small and there's usually no wait. Decent for a quick, convenient Korean meal if you're nearby","5, 4, 3, 3, 3"

But the quality is definitely there. Their cookie and cream milkshake is a must try as well. Small is the perfect amount. Everything about this place is great. This location in particular is always packed. The location is right on as it is Right on Newbury Street. But no parking lot and limited parking spots for street parking. I would recommend taking the T here or stopping by for lunch or dinner before or after shopping in the area. This location has a ton of seats, plus seats downstairs.> Shake Shack is always a go to for comfort food when I'm feeling for a burger. Their buns are so soft, the burger patty is tastey and cheese melted just right with fries always crispy.I've been here many times since they've opened. They're always packed, even to this day but since more locations have opened up in Boston the crowd is more manageable and they've expanded the restaurant to downstairs making more space to eat especially when winter occupies the seats outside.My favourite burger will always be the shackmeister burger with the crunchy shallot inside. They did it as a promotion once or twice but have stopped. I wish they would bring it back OR make onion rings as a side just like them. I'd eat on the side or stuff them in my burger.Now my go to is the Smoke Shack with the peppers and bacon, I usually add lettuce and tomato to it.> I ordered food from this place today and they mistakenly labeled my number, which resultant my food was never prepared. The people who work here refuse to check my order despite its been over 30 mins waiting and people who came after me have already finished their meals. Finally I talk to the manager and she checked my order was indeed not being prepared at all. I asked for refund and left. I understand there could be mistake during busy hours. But it's truly not professional to handle cases like this. They could at least check the order upon customers  requests, instead of avoiding any responsibilities.gyang> Love the fresh burger that shake shack offers. Plus the best service I have recieved at a fast food restaurant!> Have always enjoyed Shake Shack every time I've been! Service is friendly and super quick! Had their fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. The fries are always great too. I typically like shoestring style fries but the fries here are thicker, but oh so delicious. Will always recommend when you're looking for a quality chain burger joint!","4, 4, 1, 5, 4"

My friends and I are addicted to this place. My go-to order is either the Indo fried rice or the pad thai. I've tried the crispy basil chicken, pad see you, and rama garden as well. The food usually comes around to a little less than $10, but they take only cash if it is under $10. In times where I forget to bring cash, I just order a thai iced tea which is also delicious!  You order at the front, they give you a number, and then you go pick up your food (dine-in & to-go) and utensils. Although it is often packed with students, you can somehow always manage to find a seat. I also appreciate the to-go containers because they're microwavable & reusable!> I go to BC, but I feel like I still eat here every week. It's pretty far, not gon lie, but my friends are addicted to this place. I usually mix around with pad thai and pad see you, but my friends are obsessed with the indo fried rice? ig, its whatever floats your boat. but I am a noodle girl so...But really this place is pretty good and like mysteriously addicting.> I went to BU and I STILL come to Nud Pob 10+ years later. That's how good it is.Big portions, cheap prices, and delicious food! Can't ask for anything more. I usually order the Thai style Pad Thai with crispy chicken, Drunken Noodle, and Chiang Mai Curry Noodle. The Chiang Mai Curry is my favorite thing to order. It's HUGE. Always two meals for me and it's super delicious. The noodle dishes are great as well and I can usually get 1.5 portions out of it depending on how hungry I am. The service is quick and the food is always piping hot. I always get extra chili and love that they have it sitting in the self service area so you can have as much as you want!> Mixed feelings on dishes. Came here a year ago for a noodle dish and got a huge serving which tasted great, and for a cheap price. Came back a couple days ago for lunch and got the yen ta fo pink noodle soup off of the special menu. Very underwhelming, small portion. The seafood and fish balls inside were ok, and the noodles were so broken up and stuck together that I'm pretty sure they were not fresh. My favorite part was the fried crisp on top (eat it first so it doesn't get soggy). Was still hungry after unfortunately. Soup broth was very tangy salty - too much for me to finish (maybe not supposed to?).They do have complimentary tea and water self-serve (tea is really hot so just mix 50:50 with the ice cold water).> This place is college central! Located right next to BU dorms, theres alot of college students here. I discovered this place while I was on my journey to finding the best Thai Iced Tea. This place is one of my tops for Thai Ice Tea. There's street parking only, best to take the train here!When you walk in, its a bunch of tables where you seat yourself. If you dine in, you may grab metal utensils near the registers. If you're doing take out/ prefer plastics, they're near the door. Free water there as well! I ordered myself an Indonesian Fried Rice, it was perfect, just wish there was a bit more of the fried chicke. My friend ordered the Thai Basil Fried Rice and it was SPICYYYY. I like spicy food but this was 80% burn your tongue hahahaWhen you leave, you can ask for take out boxes/bags for your leftovers. If you finished, you sort your dish/utensils and they will clean it! It's a very casual place, not very expensive and pretty good food!","5, 4, 5, 3, 4"

The food was great, even though the portion was a bit smaller than the normal dishes. Scallops is strong recommended, it has a creamy and smoky flavor. Lamb chops was also pretty good, it's really juicy and tender, I love it.The prices are pretty reasonable as considering to the portion of the dishes, will go again!> Went when it first opened. Poutine was interesting but Duck Fat in Portland or the Gallows still was much better. Also had the lamb lollipops which were quite good but nothing ya can't make with a sous vide and cast iron pan.Would go back in a few months for a drink> Disappointing.  I've always loved La Voile (both the Brookline and Back Bay location); I figured Bar a vin 1855 would be a safe bet given it's the same management.The food (scallops and potato croquettes) lacked seasoning, which was perplexing because usually French food has a very nuanced flavor profile.  Even frozen Trader Joes has more seasoning.The salad nicoise was also underwhelming.  The tuna was seared to perfection, but lacked seasoning.  The fingerling potatoes were undercooked (fork could barely pierce), while the haricots verts were slightly overcooked.  The ambiance is lovely.  I could see going here with friends, sitting outside on a warm evening, and ordering a bottle of wine and potentially ordering an app that's hard to mess up.> This place is a hidden gem! A cozy French Wine Bar on Newbury street serving a delicious French menu with small plates & full size entree options. The service is attentive and second to none. Highly recommend!","5, 5, 4, 2, 5"

The rigatoni is big and doughy, soaking in the flavor of the ragu nicely. Ziti alla Amatriciana: Tasted pretty average, not as impressed with this one. North End pastas have all been home runs for me, so maybe it's just harder to compete, but this pasta didn't taste special at all to me. It was good by all means, but not worth $22... you can get much better for this price.As for service, there were a lot of waiters talking amongst themselves in the corner and not really paying attention to when we needed something.> Not awful, but overrated for the North End. Asked to add spinach to a dish and they said no. Waiter didn't ask to add cheese or ask if we wanted dessert (normal interactions). Granted it was Valentine's Day, but felt neglected.Chicken parm and meatballs tasted like reheated prepped meals - cold and chewy.Was so excited for this meal but unlikely I return.> Came here because the restaurant we wanted to go was full, and we didn't want to wait an hour.The service wasn't bad. Food didn't taste so good, though. Very salty. Wife and I developed mild laryngitis after the meal. Gulped down large quantities of water due to the heavy dosage of salt used in the food.The place was pricey too. $22 for a plate of ragu. After I finished my dish, I was still hungry, so I ate bread. This is a restaurant where tourists and visitors are ""slaughtered"", so why should one expect so much? Fooled me once, I guess. Won't be coming here again.> What a mediocre place. I'm utterly disappointed. This was in the center of the little Italy and one of the most popular restaurants in the area. I came with very high expectations and left with great disappointment. The dishes were really mediocre. You can tell the spaghetti was cooked without dipping back in the cold water before served so it lacked the needed texture. The dishes were priced higher as expected but it didn't come with the expected quality. I ordered the shrimp appetizer for $16, which came with 3 shrimps. While the waitress came asking how the dishes were, we replied as honestly and told her they were just ok. She then proceeded as she heard nothing and left. It was a busy Saturday night and they crammed the space with as many seatings as possible. So crammed that every times people past by, they would have to turn sideways or they pumped into you. The entire dining experience was horrible and I wouldn't want to recommend this place to my friends for sure.> Amazing Italian restaurant in North End Boston! Chefs and waiters are mostly Italian and they serve real Italian pasta. They have a really nice wine bar and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic. I tried Mom's Lasagna della Casa and Ravioli con Aragosta. Both were delicious but the sauce of the ravioli was just something else. At the end I was just dipping bread into the sauce. It was that good lol. Highly recommended restaurant!!","4, 2, 2, 1, 5"

Amazing hospitality offered which made our experience 10x's better! If you're craving something sweet, I would highly suggest the french toast- perfectly toasted with the right amount of cinnamon, chocolate sauce and fruits to top it off. Breakfast dishes with egg were made almost to perfection and the country style potatoes were nicely seasoned. Honestly, no complain on this end. If you're in the area looking for a quick and delicious breakfast spot, Theo's is the place! (Cash only)> Amazingly great breakfast!!! Everything was freshly made, and delicious. Very good price for a massive amount of food (Big Boy special).Phenomenal pancakes too!!!> Found this place based on the reviews and proximity to our hotel! We got there at about 915am on a Saturday and there was no line. We were sat in about 5 min, but as soon as we were seated a line started to form. When we left the line was probably a 40 minute wait so plan on that. The food was good. Nothing crazy special about the food, but was good hearty breakfast food! We ordered the breakfast special, super breakfast special, and eggs Benedict! All were very good. Staff was very nice and the service was good. Had a good conversation with a staff member there while eating. Felt like a mom and pop restaurant! And was definitely as described...a COZY corner! Would come back.> No frill tiny and authentic Italian diner in North End. My friend and I sat right at the bar and was able to watch the chef cook all the delicious omelets right I front of us. They use tea a l eggs and stuffed the omelets with so much goodies! This place is cash-only though> Absolutely loved Theo's. I got the ""Big Boy"" and it was just what I needed. The actual restaurant is like having breakfast in someone's home. You MUST use the bathroom...it's such a trip! I went behind the counter and walked thru the kitchen. Staff helped me pull open a trap door in the floor to access a small wooden staircase down to the basement. After I was down washing up I had to knock on the trap door in order to come back up.

Wednesday night burger night holds a special place in my heart.> We had been wanting to check our Brewer's Fork since we saw it on the top 50 list! We walked in Saturday night at 7:30 PM and did not have to wait at all. The service was really great until the end of our meal when it was hard to even get the servers attention to get the bill. We started with the flatbread salad. I loved this unique salad and was glad they didn't offer a Cesar so it encouraged you to try something new. The salad dressing was a nice vinaigrette and paired well with all of the delicious toppings. We did find a hair in the salad which was a bit of a turn off...We had the sausage pizza which was by far my favorite. The crust is so thin and chewy - just how I love it! You could taste the fennel in the sausage but it was not overpowering. The waitress recommended the carbonara pizza. It was certainly tasty and I enjoyed the Brussels and pork cracklings, but it was not as good as the sausage one. It was exciting to try something different and new though. Sadly they do not have a dessert menu. But the beer menu is top notch! Overall, I would return to try out the other pizzas!> After our first 3 visits here, would have given this a solid 4 star rating, but went yesterday and come to the conclusion it seems they lost their magic here a bit.No complaints on service - the staff is awesome.The pizza and the fantastic curated beer selection are the real stars here. But - the pizza was not as great as we remembered now; perhaps we had someone new doing the pizza oven? While the toppings were very tasty, I fear the pizza was a bit overloaded with moisture - as the middle of the pizza was far too limp and soggy for a successful thin crust pizza. We also ordered the chicken thigh appetizer which sounded great, but poorly executed; it was white long grain rice just simply dropped in the skillet and the chicken was a bit overdone and not grilled or roasted (which makes thighs all the more disappointing). All that aside, it's a great room, and even better in nicer weather with the patio open.We may give them another shot to see if we just hit an off night in the kitchen. But - with Ciao in Chelsea closer to home, that's still our go-to pizza for now.> This is the first time here . We ordered a grass feed burger and a chicken pizza it was delicious.  The burger was good the way we liked it medium . The server was on point .> Went here yeserday after we landed,had an amazing salad, Marg pizza and cheese board. They have several selections on wines/ beers as well.

If your reading I am the one who ordered two mixed combo platters with kofta kabob as the extra added protein, the spicy chicken wings and fries and a coke :) Aman just picked it up! They have THE BEST halal cart style food. It extremely similar to their New York food cart. I believe this is the same owner as the one near my undergrad school in queens. The sauces are GREAT! I love the white sauce and the spicy sauce has a nice kick to it. The lamb gyro and chicken are both flavorful and I just LOVE their rice. Compared to The Halal Guys and Chicken and Rice guys these guys are my favorite!!!!> Went in to try the halal gyro and chicken platter and was surprised to say it's amazing and food is so so good and nyc style and also sauces are best. Best customer service and good is at very reasonable price. I would go again and again.Thanks for opening this over here in Boston. Thumps up.> So I was recommended this by yelp here is my review I'll keep it short. It tastes good but whoever is saying this is how felafel is supposed to taste is right... it's absolutely delicious. But I don't go to felafel spots for the felafel I go because I can't wrap a felafel to save my life. So I order from here and all they do is throw some ingredients on pita bread fold it and hand it to you in foil and parchment paper. Like news flash, I do that at home. I hate when I'm biting into a felafel wrap and it falls all over the place. So the wrap sucks. Did I say I was going to keep this short? Good.> Very happy that there's a halal place in this neighborhood finally and what's better is their food is very tasty, neither salty nor greasy. The seating area is clean, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is friendly. I've been here for  lunch two  days in a row. I can see myself coming again very soon.> I am so so so happy this place opened up in Boston! I was never able to satisfy my NY chicken and rice craving even with the addition of halal guys in Boston. This place is just what I needed! It is absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I got takeout here (due to the current pandemic). Place seemed clean and staff was nice! She did a good job making the food. I like my food very saucy and she met up to my standards. The green chili sauce, white sauce, and hot sauce are all mouth watering. I almost went back the same day and got another place it was so good. My boyfriend had two of the pita wraps and loved them.

Lydia Shire's excellent Italian restaurant in Beacon Hill is a great getaway -- you always know what to expect and it will always be comforting, homey, and delicious. The spaghetti options are consistently alluring and I find myself drawn to the Bolognese time and again -- just perfect for a chilly winter evening, beefy and warm and tomato-y. The pizzas are delicious as well, and the mozzarella bar is fun, although not the ""best"" mozzarella I've ever had. If I'm honest, the puntarelle and cinnamon bread paired with the burrata on this particular occasion we visited were even more memorably than the cheese itself! We did think the garlic bread could have used more garlic, and the yuca gnocchi with crispy pig ears was tasty but the portion was definitely on the small side ($26 for 10-12 gnocchi and 3-5 pieces of pig ear).Dessert was fine -- we got the seasonal cookie plate but probably would opt for something more festive next time (I'm just not the biggest fan of Italian cookies, liking American gooey cookies or Scottish shortbreads and millionaire's bars a lot more). Wine was yummy as well. Service was a little odd -- I think our waiter was new and a bit overenthusiastic, and the original bill he brought us included our neighboring table's food as well. Overall, though, Scampo is a fun and fancy night out without being overly stuffy. $150 total after tax and tip, for 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert plus coffee.> I hesitate to give 5 stars allays but this place earns it. I walked in and was greeted with wonderful smiles and brought to 4 top. It was cold rainy night and this place was bright and lively.They brought a garlic green paste and breadsticks and that was cool.Then we ordered the nam  with prosciutto So fresh And delicious with yummy balsamic oil.Then the soup was buttery full of crab Then the meals were calves liver & mashed potatoes .... it's a lunch special but the server asked and they had no problem with a special request. Our server Francisco was the best. He explainEd all the fancy words on the menu and made great  recommendtions and checked on us and brought laughter to the table.I ordered the pesto  scallops pasta and so creamy and thick and I really couldn't finish it.The atmosphere is fun everyone is smiling and I will  be back here> I ate dinner here with a large group. The food was bad-to-dangerous and the service was all attitude. The only thing allowing for this review to be a 1 was the work of the gentleman who I believe was the manager, Zan. So for the bad/dangerous dangerous. Most egregious were the orders of the two pork chops. One person ordered medium and the other medium rare and both were flat out raw in the middle- we're talking sashimi grade. I was one of the recipients and was pretty grossed out by it. Now...stuff like this happens, and I like to think I'm reasonable. People are imperfect, including chefs, so I actually don't hold the chefs responsible. But once our food arrived no one came back to check on us to see how it was going. Finally after 12 minutes I grabbed a bus staff member and asked them to send over our server. 5 minutes after that, that she arrives and was grumpy about being told that her food was raw. Now having lost my appetite both from the raw pork texture and the healthy dose of attitude, I told her to just take it back - I didn't want anything else. I had considered asking to have it fired some more, but it took too darn long at that point. I was not satisfied with this exchange with the wait staff, so rather than make a scene with her, I got up to talk to someone at the host/hostess stand. Zan, who I think was the manager, was understanding and took both items off the check which was the minimum right thing to do and was apologetic for his wait staff's disgruntlement. But given that it was not edible (unless you were planning on dying of trichinosis that evening) and that I didn't eat anything else I suspect they could have been more creative in offering a solution/resolution. I came back to the table to find out that the same wait staff member tried to argue with the other recipient of raw pork that ""he ordered medium rare."" Ridiculous and that's what prompted me to write a review. Waitstaff, too, are entitled to a bad day, but there is no world in which this person could have possibly been right in this situation.  Separately, the Indian / Italian fusion wasn't working. Sorry, prosciutto with chutney isn't a thing, now or ever. The other dishes were fine - best thing on the table was the pea puree and breadsticks that preceded dinner. But you can skip the elephant ear bread, the overcooked naan, and the overpriced mozzarrella bar. Several other diners' fish dishes were overcooked. Calamari was the only reasonably-priced-not-that-weird-of-a-dish-passable item. Speaking of overpriced. No parking validation and $35 for valet? The website touts that you can park in the MGH garage, but guess what? To get any reasonable pricing you need to be patient or visitor of a patient. That was the real kick in the teeth at the end of the expensive night.  This place should never get more than 3 stars based on price and offering alone. But attitude from wait staff over dangerously cooked food is completely unacceptable. And it's such a shame. The restaurant is in such a cool building and has a lot of potential.> Another restaurant that we ate at two times in two days! We flew in from PDX and had a delicious dinner, lobster pizza, Italian wine, it was fantastic. So fantastic that we retuned with another coworker for lunch the following day! We had the Cesar salad, margarita pizza, a la vongole and coffee... another delicious meal!The champagne upon checkin to the hotel was also a lovely touch... can't wait to return!> We had an amazing experience here. Both my wife and I were in Boston for work and had the luxury of staying at the Liberty and made Scampo a date night. Fava bean purée that was served immediately was incredible. Parmesan cheese sticks for dipping. Unreal.  Chef Lydia stopped by to say hi and I asked her how to make both and she didn't hesitate to tell me, which I thought was so nice! We did have an amazing people watching opportunity, but that was just luck.If you get a chance, have a drink at the lobby bar and head to Scampo for dinner!","4, 5, 1, 5, 5"

Honestly, I highly recommend. My go to place for dim sum at odd hours is Dim Sum Cafe. Food is always hot and delicious. They've got a good amount of fan favorites, even though mine wasn't available that day (shrimp with long rice noodle). The prices were right and the location great because we all went to tea do after for some games and bubble after.Also I just wanted to flag that there is a $30 minimum for credit card charges. I'll keep coming back again and again.> This place is the worst dim sum place I've ever  visited. Super bad service. The waiter would yell at you for not giving enough tips. Why would I give him tips when he gave me such bad services? Everyone please don't go to this place. They don't respect customers. Treat customers like shit!!> So as far as yelp goes, every place in chinatown essentially has 3.5 stars. There's no shining 5 star. There's no, pretty good 4.5 star. This place was across the street from where we were standing at the time, it was cold out, and there wasn't a wait. I would like to point out that the cat thing wasn't waving. I don't know what that means but I feel like I should at least say so here. After a quick traffic jam near the entrance (the place is small), we were seated immediately at one of the group tables and provided some tea. As alluded to by another reviewer, there isn't much in the ways of vegetarian options here. I saw vegetarian dumplings before coming into this place and that was all I needed. We also ordered scallion pancakes (how can you not), and vegetable lo mein. We had been dying of thirst all day long and both pulled the trigger on a coke. The food actually came out in a staggered fashion but quickly. The lo mein arrived first and it was a nice, large plate of thin noodles mixed with sprouts, onions, and the occasional green pepper slice. The scallion pancakes came out next and they were followed by the dumplings. When you're already thirsty, Chinese food is only going to make matters worse. There was no coke anywhere to be found. I chugged the hot tea provided as my serum sodium climbed. I caught the server as she passed our table and reminded her about the 2 cokes we ordered. She made some annoyed gesture and continued walking. The noodles were spectacular. They were absolutely delicious and frankly some of the best lo mein I've ever had. The scallion pancakes were crisp TO DEATH and also amazing. The ""vegetable dumplings"" had pork in them so thankfully my meat vacuum GF bit into them before I did. That's kinda bullshit. We never did get the cokes. Ever. Might I suggest hiring servers, the people who are interacting with the customers in Boston, that can speak English or at least understand basic restaurant vocabulary like ""coke"". If you're vegetarian beware also maybe bring your own beverages or someone who can translate ""coke"" or ""sprite"" for you.> Not sure where to go with this review.  I admit I am not a dim sum expert but I have an adventurous palate and lots of Asian meals under my belt. My wife and I ordered a variety of chicken feet, dumplings, buns, etc.  The food was delivered quickly and at a reasonable price.  Despite that, nothing impressed us... almost boring. We expected more.  For example, the pork ribs in black bean sauce consisted of a handful of bones with almost no meat and a couple of Chinese black beans.  It was completely flavorless which is disappointing considering how delicious Chinese pork can be and how intense fermented black beans should be.  The service was brusque and rushed which is not atypical for ethnic restaurants moving lots of people through.  We will probably try another dim sum place next time we visit Chinatown.> The actual rating is 2.5 stars but will give it a 3 star for serving dim sum during dinner time.Came here on a weekday at around 8 PM, and we got seated right away. Then close to 8:30 PM, more people showed up, and the restaurant was pretty much full. We ordered ha gow, shu mai, pork in black bean sauce, green, and pork congee. The ha gow skin is very thick, and the shrimp is mixed with some other stuffing. Doesn't seem to be very fresh. The shu mai doesn't taste very fresh, either. It has a different texture to it from other dim sum places I've been to. The pork in black bean sauce does not have the black bean sauce flavor at all, and rather it is covered in either sesame or cooking oil. The greens are good, but that is hard to mess up. The pork congee is good with generous serving but lacks salt. Unfortunately, next time for dim sum, Winsor won't be the top of my list.  Overall, it was a disappointing visit. The service was also severely lacking. The 3 stars are just for food. If I were to factor in the service here, oh well, it will be much lower. First of all, it took much time to get iced water. Then, it took much time to put in our order where the waiter walked towards our table multiple times, we made eye contacts, but they just walked away. Later, the congee was served without a spoon, so I had to ask for that twice. If I were to rate its service and compare it with other Boston Chinatown restaurants, this is definitely one of the worst.","4, 4, 1, 3, 3"

The chicken itself was crispy and flavorful. The fried rice was not good because it was mushy and tasteless. To mention, I was charged an additional $3 for substituting the white rice for fried rice.Parking is very difficult as there is no parking lot available -- street parking.> I've been going to Chinatown cafe since I was a child and I'm so happy it's still around. As an adult I must say I enjoy their food a lot more now than I did as a child. They have increased their quality of food. Their portions still remains the same. They aren't stingy like other restaurants. The exterior doesn't attract me, nor does their interior, but it's their quality of food. Right when you walk in you can see the meat option-pig, duck, spare ribs, chicken, you name it. Everyone here is super friendly. Their staff here mainly speaks Chinese, but they do have the cashier and the male answering the phone who knows perfect English. These two are super nice!!! The menu is in Chinese and in English which makes everyone's lives easier as there is a full description. They have seats if you prefer eating there. They also have hot water and tea you can help yourself with if you do decide on eating there. My go to is their wonton noodle soup with spareribs and their general gao chicken. Generally I like eating there since I like my chicken nice and hot when it comes out. Both of these cost no more than $20. Again, their portions are a lot bigger than other places. My boyfriend and I shared both of these plates and we even had some general gao and rice left over. They have gender neutral bathrooms!!! (Pretty gross though if you ask me but does the job) FYI- cash only! No debit/credit cards.> Wow. Where do I begin? Wonton noodle soup with brisket.  Terrible. The wontons were as big as my first and the pork was shaped like a meatball. The wonton wraps fell apart as I picked them up with my chopsticks. The meat tasted like a rubber ball.  The pepper/salt calamari wasn't seasoned enough.  Not only that, but they were sneaky.  They layered the box with too much lettuce.  From the picture, you'd think it was a calamari salad. Oh, and we left the restaurant, we heard the manager lose his temper by cursing up a storm in Cantonese.  Not cool.> This place rocks! Was in Boston recently and got take out from Chinatown Cafe twice because it was so good! The first time we ordered several orders of their roast duck over wonton noodle soup and their tofu ""wonton noodle soup"". The portion size was so generous. I counted at least 6 large shrimp and pork wontons and 5 or 6 pieces of duck. The noodles and soup were great! The next day we ordered a few more of the same items and decided to try their bbq pork this time. It did not disappoint. For ~$10, it's such a deal for the amount of food you get. Each bowl is enough for at least 2 people.> One of the classic restaurants thats been in Chinatown for as long as I can remember. Its not a fancy waited restaurant but a place to get comfort food for about $10 or less.Chinatown Cafe does get packed so the best bet is to call and go in to pick up. If you have time and want to eat there, they have a good amount of tables and chairs you can choose from. Food comes in very generous portions for the price you pay. Theres complementary water and tea and a gender neutral bathroom :) The walls are decorated with pictures of Chinatown from many years ago, very historic. Most staff there speaks some to fluent English :) an alternative is just to tell them the number from the menu.","4, 4, 5, 1, 1"

The food is consistently delicious. Always amazing flavors, always well cooked. The service is consistently attentive and kind. Every time I leave, I leave with a full stomach and full heart.> This was the first place that I had Luc Loc, from there I fell in love with that dish.  While the food is considered Cambodian, many of my Cambodian friends have never heard of many of these dishes.  I also think that is a reflection of the poverty in Cambodia more than the dishes being Americanized.  Having also purchased food to go, it is equally good.  What did I learn today?  Looking for a new food adventure?  Give Elephant Walk a try.> Came here for Dine-Out Boston week, so expectations were set low for quality of service and portion sizes.We weren't offered bread, although a la cart tables were. Started with the rouleaux (Cambodian pork spring rolls) and chilled avocado citrus soup. Rouleaux came two pieces with veggies, quite tasty but the rolls were disproportionately small compared to the veggies. Soup I expected more avocado taste, but the chunks were surprisingly what I expected. Good tangy flavor, but I wanted more avocado.Mains were the seared scallops and the braised beef short rib noodles. The portions were actually surprisingly large for Dine-Out week, and the meat on both was cooked to perfection, especially the braised beef - very moist, not dry. I wish the scallops had a bit more seasoning and flavor, but the corn succotash with it was perfect, but there was a bit too much pepper overall. The noodles on the beef dish was well-executed, but nothing unique or special.Dessert was mango sticky rice and coconut milk custard. The rice on the sticky rice was a little hard, as though it dried out in the fridge, and mango is.. Well, deliciously mango lol. The coconut milk custard fared much better, but the consistency was more cake like and less custard, although it tasted deliciously like custard. Texture makes me think it was in the fridge for too long too, though.Overall, we'd come back for the a la cart menu, but we're undecided on dessert. Good value for Dine-Out week, though.Yay: the mains and spring rolls, custard tasteNay: mango sticky riceMeh: avocado citrus soup, size of the apps, custard texture> Second visit to The Elephant Walk but the first time for dinner.  Booked a reservation well in advance, and I'm glad as the restaurant had just a few empty tables.   Our waitress was lovely and knowledgeable about the menu.   Started with Rouleaux, crispy Camodian spring rolls that you wrap in lettuce and dip a tuk trey sauce - delicious!  Flavors compliment each other perfectly. Entree Crevettes Et Pates De Riz Fraiches, rice noodles sauteed with shrimp, snap peas, bean sprouts, chive and red pepper in a garlic sauce, nice dish and a perfect portion size.   So many things I wanted to try on the menu so I will have to go back!   Friendly staff and great location in the South End.   Will become a must visit when in Boston.> Amazing! Had a great sampling during A Bites of Boston food tour and had to come back!My husband and I both got the Dine-out Boston menu as well as cocktails and everything was fantastic!

Beautiful, cozy interiors.  Reasonable prices.  What's not to love about Life Alive? My favorite food dish is their Spicy Peanut Noodles.  Flavorful with a slight kick, these noodles have great bounce/bite.  Portion size could be two meals imo.  My favorite smoothie is their Blue Magic.  I love the creaminess the coconut milk adds, and they always beat it to a light and frothy consistency.This is my go to spot in the area and their extensive menu makes me excited to come back every time (still going through their juices and lattes).  It's so rare to find a restaurant where veggie/vegan dishes are the focus as opposed to the afterthought.  Yes, By Chloe and Tatte are next door which both have great veggie/vegan options; however, those spots don't feel as cozy and homey as Life Alive.  I love the bright, colorful (some might say quirky and hippie) aura of this place.  They have velvet and knits and cushions and throw pillows - eating a meal with a book outside of my home has never been so comfortable.  Random note: I'm so pleased that they have self-serve water in carafes and glasses too (I'm so tired of refusing single-use cups, even if they're commercially compostable!)Definitely come check this place out and hopefully you'll become an avid fan too!> Location: Located at the heart of newbury street, close to famous cafe Tatte. Easy to spot, and access to.Ambiance: super cute, very hipstery artsy vibe and interior inside. Very colorful and bright warm tone colors.  Food: Green bowl was a bit saltier and it was alot of rice and grains compare to the actual veggies. Adventurer bowl was crunch and was definately more flavorful Service: It was quite confusing and super busy when we walked in so that was a little down side since I personally prefer more personal space.  But it's popular place and in the middle of Newbury street I understand. Our cashier wasn't super friendly but the workers were friendly once we found the seat.  I feel like all the workers were super busy and there needs to be more worker or space for this placeTips: so when you walk in you basically need to grab a menu and start ordering and find a place to sit. So definately check out the menu at yelp and decide before hand will help> I loved it! Fast friendly and attentive staff. Comfortable and unique cafe. There's something on the menu for the whole fam. GREAT INTRO TO VEGAN FOOD   balanced and nutritious The rainbow Harvest bowl and coconut alive smoothie were amazing! Next time I'll get a large smoothie-if you like coconut MUST TRY   2 bowls 2 smoothies and a tea was over 50$ with a decent tip- a little expensive but i asked to add almonds and avocado to The bowls incase they were mostly rice. But the rice to veggies ratio was good. Seemed like they skimmed on the tofu since I asked for other things in it but over all happy with the experience and would highly recommend to anyone!> Life alive is at it again, CRUSHING the restaurant game. I absolutely love this location as it's spacious, aesthetic, has plenty of outlets, and exudes a warm, healthy vibe. However, at peak times, the lunch rush absolutely fills the place up, and it's very difficult to find a place to sit/eat. I recommend going pre 11:45 or post 1:30.  In terms of the food, I cannot recommend the Adventurer bowl enough! I struggle each time in deciding whether to branch out or stick with this tried-and-true bowl. The deviled eggs, peanut bowl, and lattes are also all fantastic. As an all day cafe, they also have great coffee (complete with oat milk), and I love their breakfast bowl and still need to try the pancakes/waffles. I will say the two negatives are the cold brew coffee and the smoothie bowls. The cold brew tasted a bit like very weak, cold, drip coffee, and the smoothie bowls are a bit icy for my liking.> I love a clean fresh place like thiS. It is soooo Uber hip and every one is super healthy. I am healthy or vegan and I wanted au bon pain but it's this cool place. I walked in and the girl behind thhe register explained everything. I told her it was my 1st time and she helped me order the THAI PEANUT SUTRA  with the kinda spicy sauce on the side. Let me tell toU I it was so  crispy and fresh . Each fork  had more I inteerwting flavor. It's a salad and it was filling! I wish it  came with a roll and some butter but something tells me this is not thaT place.I got a glass of ginger kombucha which had a lot of kick to it. I would totally come back  here great WiFi and really comfortable seating arrangements","5, 3, 4, 5, 5"

You will find me here every Monday for $1 Oysters, I'll let you all figure out what the other specials are!Hint: book a day early or you won't find a tableOverall:Great, simple taqueria with fun drinks and specials!> Date night for taco Tuesday. Unfortunately we found that only 5/10 (roughly) tacos were actually discounted and the discount was only about $1 off each taco. With that said, tacos were very flavorful. I got the Carnitas Tacos which were filled with flavor. Haley got guacamole tacos which she enjoyed. We started with chips and guacamole which were good as well. For drinks, we both got margaritas. Mine was on the heavy side, didn't care too much for it (seeing that it was $11 was a downside as well). Overall, been to this restaurant multiple times and will go back. Next time, probably just stick with (and recommend) the beer.> 3.5 rating - Had dinner plans for my belated birthday with my best friend and stumbled upon this place after I found out my original pick was closed this week.  I was excited to try something new after deciding to go here as the next option because who doesn't love tacos?Walked into a beautiful restaurant with pretty hanging lights, a vibrant crowd, music and lots of smiling faces.  Large bar set up in the middle with tables on the sides and front.  Table for 2 was quick and easy at close to 7pm.Things you should know that I didn't..-If you go as a party of 2, go as a date because you will get squeezed inbetween first dates and overhear life introductions for the entire duration.  Seating is far enough for personal space but you can't unhear things either haha-Tuesdays is 1/2 price tacos.  Didn't realize until we saw a tiny slip of paper on the table to order oysters.  Check out the info and ask questions to get the scoop.  The scoop doesn't come to you.-If you don't drink, you have no reason to come.  Drive bys happen often here.  I wish I could have several shots of tequila and rack up a tab for you dear but I am breastfeeding an infant.  I only have 2 hours to snack for dinner, catch up with my best friend about life stuff, including life as a new mother of 2 with no time to herself, and run home to my husband who is watching 2 kiddos and waiting for me.. I am leaving soon right after this story............-The oysters were yum.  Try some.-I liked the baja fish taco the best.  Fried chicken was delish too.  -Fried chicken taco is spicy.  Don't say I didn't warn you.Overall, I recommend checking it out if you are in the area and want a drink and snack.  I need to get out more.  Maybe I picked the wrong spot and night out.> Loco deserves the hype it receives for being a great food and drink destination in an otherwise lacking part of Boston. The tacos are bomb, the oysters are delicious, and the margaritas have been solid. They also do chips and guac right, with healthy portions of each to share (one order filled two of us up comfortably). And, while it's not cheap, the menu won't break the bank, so it's a good option for a weekend or after work meal.So why four stars? The NOISE. It's so incredibly loud inside this restaurant. Add live music to the fray on the weekends, and you can barely hear the person across the table from you. I love the space, but wish they'd do more to separate the more energetic bar area from the sit-down diners.> Loco is a trendy taco joint serving up bites and drinks to the young professional crowd in Southie. If you walk in after work, or on weekends, you're likely to find a crowded establishment with well-dressed patrons set to the backdrop of twinkly lights, a wrap-around bar, wooden accents, and an oyster bar! I decided to be adventurous and order their coconut margarita. It had a coconut flake rim and was sweet and creamy. We also got chips and guac, which were solid but a little overpriced ($11). But, oh WOW. I ordered a veggie quesadilla with chicken added and it was probably the best quesadilla I've ever had. Flavor. Explosion. For those sour beer lovers out there, the Two Roads Lime Gose was also notable.","5, 4, 3, 4, 5"
Noodles King,Boston,4.0,2,Null,Null,Yes,Null,"Noodles, Chinese",Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,"This restaurant is located in the Longwood Galleria's food court. It is not your typical ""American"" Chinese food; thankfully! The noodles and dumplings are very authentic- confirmed by my Chinese friend. The ingredients are fresh. And you can watch the cooks pull and boil the noodles. It's quite fascinating. My go to is the #6 Spicy Dan Dan noodles. I have tried several other dishes but none compare to the Dan Dan noodles. The Dan Dan noodles are as thick as spaghetti soaked in a ""spicy"" red sauce, mixed with ground beef, peanuts and herbs. In my opinion the dish is not spicy but I also have high tolerance of spice.  The pork dumplings are also very good but are not always available and usually take longer to prepare. I believe the dumplings are made ahead of time then possibly frozen and cooked as needed. If you want your typical ""American"" Chinese food there are two options next to Noodle King.> Probably the best option one could get in the Galleria. The noodles take a bit of time to come out even when there is no line because they boil the noodles fresh for each order. Their shanxi hand pulled noodles are nice and chewy with plenty of chili oil and garlic. The noodles also come with a lot of bean sprouts. I've tried their other noodle soups but they just aren't as flavorful as the shanxi hand pulled noodles.The shandong pork bao is huge and packed with meat.  The flavors are milder than the noodle dishes because the bao is not spicy.This is one of the more authentic meals you could get in the area, but I wish their portions were larger for the price.> FYI those THICK-CUT noods in #1 can now be substituted  into ANY of the noodle dishes for an extra $3!!! I've ordered #2, 3, 7, 8 so far w the thick-cut noods and it's completely elevated my noodle experience here!It's not written anywhere on the menu or counter space, so just tell the lady when ordering:-) YOU'RE WELCOME> Noodle King is excellent, and exceeds expectations given the location (I mean both Boston and a random food court in the Longwood Area). Staff are businesslike but quick, which is what I want from a food court vendor, and the menu is down-to-business as well, with a mix of hand-pulled dry noodles and noodle soups, and some vegetarian options as well as bao and dumplings to boot.I ordered the dry noodles (#1, $11.95) and the Shandong pork bun ($3.95). Both were really yummy -- the noodles were flavorful with garlic and spice, and not too oily, with some crunchy bok choy as well. The bao was STUFFED with meat, tofu, wood ear mushrooms, green beans (seems atypical but it was good), and rice noodles.While my total bill ended up being $17 or so which is quite expensive for lunch, the bao alone was enough for me for lunch, leaving me quite a heap of noodles leftovers for dinner. Not too bad, I'll be back!> I usually don't leave reviews. But I have too. I was visiting a family at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. I was running around allMorning and had nothing to eat. Visit my family for 10 mins then my friend and I walked over to the long woods food court. I order 3 different noodles to try. They look so good on yelp . But I turns out it wasn't. Not my taste at all. So we threw out the 3 noodles and a shrimp dumplings.When I got back to the hospital. I was not feeling good. I thought it's because of the oils in the noodles. But when I got home yesterday night .. I started to have chills and the fever all night. And now my stomach is rumbling . I definitely know this feeling. I have food poisoning. Not something I'm looking forward too since I have little ones to take care of.","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

I've been coming to this gem for years. Sahil and Tony on the bar make you feel like you are at home -- if your home was filled with amazing tapas (paella is also outrageously good) and a fully stocked bar with a creative drink menu. Every Monday night I ""work late"" and come to Estragon for 2 items off their tapas menu and 2(ish) grapefruit gimlets. This is also a great meeting spot no matter where in Boston you are -- the bar is typically full, but you can always get a seat with no more than a short wait in the main dining room. The ambiance is spot on as well. Its a fun quirky feel and I've gone here with a wide range of folks from my mom to client prospects. It's also a favorite for members of my team as we come here to celebrate wins or commiserate on the week. TLDR: Come here and embrace the atmosphere, be amazed by the food and prices, dabble in delicious drinks, and appreciate the best bar service in Boston I've ever had. BONUS: There is always ample parking right out front too.> This was place was pretty average for tapas. The food was pretty good, and there was a decently sized selection of food and drinks. For this price though, I think I can get dinner at a much nicer place with higher quality dishes. Dinner was about $300 for 4 people, and it was just the right amount of food. I think 2-3 tapas per person is enough, but of the dishes we ordered, nothing really stood out to me. Parking was surprisingly easy to find on a Saturday night. It's mostly metered parking, but there was plenty of space when we arrived. There were also quite a few empty tables when we got there too, but once it hit 8pm, the whole place was full. I would say this is a nice place to catch up over drinks and shared tapas, but nothing else really stands out to me. We did find our waiter to be pretty impressive. He didn't take any notes when we placed our order (10+ dishes and 2 drinks all at once), and he got almost everything right. The only thing he got wrong was the seafood paella he brought out, when we ordered the squid ink paella. Still pretty impressed!> Came here the other night for the tapas happy hour! (Tapas ranging from 2 to $5, Monday - Thursday from 5 pm to 7). They only offer this deal at the bar, which was full when we arrived, so we had to be pretty persistent and wait about 15 minutes before snagging a spot.Ambience is nice. Checkered floor, quirky furniture, varied seating, twinkly lights and book shelves! Service at the bar was quick and consistent. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. In general, the food was pretty good, but keep in mind that portions from the happy hour menu are quite small. (You'll need to order a lot!)The real stand-out dish for me was the chorizo, which was packed with flavor and tasted truly authentic. We wrapped up dinner with a chocolate olive oil mousse topped with maldon salt. Overall a solid experience!> Great food and amazing atmosphere. It will have you coming back for more! One of the better spanish restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in Boston. I enjoyed every single one of the tapas we ordered. From the mini meatballs to the shrimp to the roasted brussel sprouts, everything was delicious. I love it when restaurants know how to balance the flavors and the chef here knows what hes doing. The meatballs had a great texture and was on point. It wasn't overly salty and the sauce packed was ooof so good. Roasted brussel sprouts are one of my favorite things in the world and when pired with bacon it just blows me away everytime. I really enjoyed how it had a crispy bite on the outside from the char but soft on the inside. The extremely crispy bacon bits added that finishing touch. By far those 2 were my favorite of the night. Overall I would highly recommend you to come check out Estragon! You won't be disappointed.> Went here on a date for the happy hour menu and was not disappointed. Our favorite was the Huevo Roto ($5), which is a fried egg over salty, crunchy fries-- so good that we ended up ordering another. The Manchego y Jamon is good and great for the happy hour price ($2); I personally would skip the Patatas Alioli ($2), which is like a potato salad, but I don't really love potatoes all that much. The Mini Chorizo a La Cidra were great ($5), and we used the extra cider to dip the fries in...yum! The Coca Mini was good for the price ($5)-- a very small pizza with BBQ beef and parmesan. All of the above are happy hour prices and only available between 5-7 at the bar.The best part was that I had the best drink of my recent life, Delta Dawn, with bourbon, lemon, and peach. I wanted to order another but a) we didn't have time and b) it wasn't large for the price. Excited to go back!","5, 3, 4, 5, 5"
BONAPITA,Boston,4.5,1,No,Yes,Yes,bonapita.com,"Mediterranean, Bakeries, Food Delivery Services",Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,"I'm just popping in to say that almost four years later, Bonapita is still a lunch staple and still five stars in my book. Chicken a la plancha, toss it - herb hummus on the side. The pita bread that comes on the side is delicious and meals are prepared quickly and are always flavorful. I also recently discovered the bowls and loooooooooove the vegetables. Still recommend this place. Check it out.> The falafel was well cooked and was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Ordered a toss it with falafel. The quantity is a lot I feel and so is the price. Wish they can make a small bowl and so the price. They have a few tables so having it there isn't a problem for a weekday lunch.> I've had only good experiences at Bonapita except once when there was an issue with the portion sizes, but the owner reached out and fixed the situation. Since then I've been a happy customer. Unfortunately my visit today wasn't as enjoyable as previously. It seems they've updated their bowls which now means everything is mixed - although you get more food, everything is now a soggy mess that seeps through the bottom of the bowl. Furthermore they also add the hummus in instead of on the side, meaning it's hot and sticks to all the food when you get around to eating instead of being used for dipping the pita. Although I am disappointed by this and miss their old bowls with hummus on the side, that wouldn't in and of itself justify writing this review. Unfortunately I found a piece of plastic nestled deep within the food. It was quite big and therefore easy to spot, but thinking about what other smaller pieces may be in there left me unable to finish.> I have such a love-hate relationship with Bonapita. When it's good, it's reallllyyyy good but sometimes it's just so disappointing and unfortunately the disappointing visits are becoming more and more frequent. I get the same thing every time I go to Bonapita: toss it (salad) with chicken a la plancha and spicy hummus. The chicken is always cooked well and very flavorful, the pita is soft, fresh and pillowy and the spicy hummus is SO delicious. My issue is with consistency. Sometimes my salad is really great with a fresh tasting dressing and an acceptable amount of chicken. Other times, it's like I'm eating salad soup, with so much liquid at the bottom of my salad that I have to dump it out. Today, I dumped about  1/2 a cup of liquid from my bowl - and my salad was really soggy because of it. Sometimes it seems as though there's barely any chicken on my salad. On other visits, they've given me the wrong hummus or no hummus at all, so I've gotten into the habit of checking my bag before I leave. Recently, they changed their packaging and while I love that they serve the salad in a bowl now, I was disappointed to find that my spicy hummus was globbed on the top of my salad when it used to be served on the side. Guess I'll have to ask for it on the side from now on. I wish Bonapita would address some of these consistency issues; but in the meantime, I just can't give them more than three stars.> Quick lunch here at Bonapita today. They don't have a huge menu but that is what gets things moving along. A few choices for bases (salad, plate, pita sandwich) and a few choices for proteins (marinated chicken, beef meatballs, black bean & beet patties, mushrooms) topped and ready to go.I chose the chicken with a ""fill it"" and added spicy hummus. The sandwich was very good. Great flavors and textures with crunchy veggies and a sauce, nicely filled with a good serving of spicy chicken. The hummus in a small pot added nothing and I'd probably skip this next time.A good lunch and not expensive at all.","5, 5, 4, 2, 3"

But at Ruka, every single thing that we have order was AMAZING! Everything was so good that we were fighting each other to eat more! We had the Wagyu Steak, Bao Chicka Wow Bao,Chicken Fried Rice and the Lima Style Fried Calamari. As I said before all of them were extremely delicious. But there was one that I cannot forget. The Bao Cichka Wow Bao! If you ever go to Boston, you must try this Bao!! You won't regret it> Went to Raku on Friday night.. it was a hip little spot a few doors down from the Opera Hose in downtown Boston. I got an order of King Tupac and the oysters.. both were very tasty, worth a try. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. The atmosphere was enjoyable, fun and hip. Cons: I noticed one of the bartenders massage another bartenders head and then serve a drink without washing his hands..I also ordered takeout for later (spicy salmon  roll and chicken fried rice) it came in a timely manner but when I took it out to eat it later on, there was no soy sauce, wasabi or ginger with the sushi, nor did they pack utensils or napkins, not even chopsticks - so I was off to hunt these down at the hotel I was at - kind of a pain.> We stopped here before a show at the Opera House, and overall I would say 3.5 stars. The ambiance and service were really great with plenty of bar seating. A lot of fusion places seem to be a mess of flavors without truly coming together, but this fusion was fun, interesting, and tasty. Plates are a little expensive for the serving size, so you'll rack up a bill pretty quickly if you're hungry. We needed 9 plates for 3 people.Ruka spicy tuna- my favorite roll of the night. A simple classic and generous servingHamachi amarillo- where the fusion style really shines. The pepper brings an unexpected twist to the classic spicy tunaGarlic shrimp- really delicious on its own. It came with a lemon-soy butter, and you could taste each individual flavor but didn't really blend in a particularly enjoyable wayTuna poke- small portion but a wonderful blend of flavors. Fried shallots added great texture, and grapefruit adds a palate cleanserBaby street corn- my least favorite of the night. Small portion, charred and chewy tips, and too salty to be enjoyable.Lima style friend calamari- perfectly crispy, a balanced combination of flavors, and a touch of spicyChao shou pork wontons- not my favorite and definitely not what I was expecting (more of a dumpling than a wonton). Chicken and garlic fried rice- portion was small, but rice was perfectly al dente and very flavorful. Can't go wrong with either option, but getting both is unnecessary> Decided to try this place out for a friend's birthday. When we sat down, it took almost 15 minutes to be greeted by a waiter to even get us water or drinks. After waiting a little bit longer after the drinks order, we ordered, we got our drinks--I got the passion project and it was not bad. Not too strong, not too light. The food was pretty good too.We got the hamachi ceviche, blackened octopus, wagyu steak, and other stuff that I don't recall the names but the pictures look great. Oh! For dessert, we got the big fish. The hamachi ceviche has a good mixture between the soft fish, crunchy crisps, and richness from the avocados. The presentation is pretty nice too. Blackened octopus tastes like it was just a bit over cooked because it was a bit rubbery but it was 'good'. Wouldn't say it was bad, but definitely not as good as the ceviche. The flavor was great though. Wagyu steak....was it wagyu tho? My friend said that she had wagyu in Japan before and it is suppose to just melt in your mouth, this one took a little more chew to it if you know what I mean...but once you get into that chew.. (did anyone get the hot pickle reference).  Lastly the big fish that everyone loves to eat. It was pretty interesting, a bit burnt at places but hey, who doesn't love a little carcinogen here and there in their life. It's a mixture of ice cream and berries if I recall correctly which is a good ending to the night. Very average tho. Service was all right. We felt like we waited a long time to even get greeted for water but hey...not my restaurant","5, 5, 4, 4, 3"

I'm surely heading there the next time I'm there!> Came here on a Wednesday night for trivia, one of their many fun events held at the bar. This time they had a special Halloween themed trivia and for normal times they held regular trivia nights. The host is very nice, phrasing the questions very explicitly so that you won't miss any details. On the other hand, it's kinda too much tedious and boring descriptions. Question designs are standard, nothing crazy.One of the rules here is that if you come with a party of 6+ people, you can't win first prize. Second prize at top, which is a $15 gift card to use at the bar.Food wise, I only ordered a plate of fried onion rings and it's very mediocre and too greasy. Apparently my friends had some tasty burgers so prob I'm not quite fair here. Solid selections of beer. Music is classy, fun to hang out with friends.> Solid choice for a pre-game meal. We stopped here for a quick dinner before a game at TD Garden as it is only a couple of blocks away. It wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately. When we peeked inside, many tables were designated as Reserved. However, we were seated at one of these - I guess they do that to prevent people just having drinks from sitting there?Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We chose the Boston's Best Burger with fries and Grilled Chicken on Focaccia Sandwich with sweet potato fries. The burger was good but far from the best. The chicken was very good with a generous portion, but the bread didn't have a lot of flavor as focaccia might suggest.The drinks weren't crazy at a little over $6 for beer. Much cheaper than $15+ inside of TD Garden.Overall, not a bad pick for pre-gaming. Food seems reliable but not outstanding.> This is a really nice bar.  It has your standard bar food and a nice selection of beers.  The bartenders are friendly and stay on top of things.   This place gets booked when the Bruins are playing so plan accordingly. If going to the Garden to catch a game, I highly recommend!> Was a terrible experience that just kept going downhill.We came for lunch and didn't have high expectations and just wanted some decent bar food.We split a clam chowder, and I got a burger and my friend got a sandwich. The clam chowder was tasty but a little cold. And on a cold November day, we would have really wanted something a bit hotter.When my burger came out, the bun was completely cold. I've never picked up a burger and just from the temperature, felt my appetite leaving my body. I mean toasted would be nice, but at least make sure it's not stone cold. The sandwich wasn't better. My friend didn't even finish half because the bread wasn't good. She also expressed that her sweet potato fries were pretty cold. Each of the 3 dishes we got had temperature problems. When we got the bill, we had a question about the pricing about the clam chowder. On the menu, they made it look like it was a soup of the day, so when I asked the waitress about the pricing, she treated us really rudely.Up until now, the food had been just okay, but this is what really made me feel that I will never ever return. The waitress started raising her voice and had this condescending tone. I asked her for the menu just so I could describe why I was confused. But she kept talking in a tone as if were stupid. It was as if she was unloading all of her frustrations out on us when we just wanted some clarification. Confusion can happen but she handled it really poorly. Because of her behavior I asked to speak to the manager, but fortunately for her, the manager wasn't there conveniently. We paid but I had this feeling like we were ripped off. NEVER coming back here again, that's for sure.","5, 3, 3, 5, 1"

They start you off with warm bread and olive oil which was delicious. We got an order of calamari and bruschetta for the table and we were very impressed with both! Our bruschetta came out after we had finished the calamari, but it was definitely worth the wait.  For my main course I ordered the sauteed chicken with a side of penne with pink sauce and it was incredible! Each dish that isn't pasta comes with a side of your choice. All pasta sides come with red sauce but if you ask for pink it's only a $2 up charge and it is most definitely worth it!

The only reason I am giving four stars is because there was one server for the whole restaurant, while there weren't many people there for a Friday night service was still much slower than anticipated.> TreMonte has well portioned side dishes that one would not hesitate to offer to share with their dining companions.  It was but $6 each for a healthy portion of the colorful assorted grilled vegetables, their sauteed spinach with cloves of garlic, and their chive infused mashed potatoes.  They offer different sides daily.However their caprese $10 was not as well valued with four small slices of tomatoes sandwiching half moons of mozzarella topping the bed of arugula.PS - I am generally pleased with the service here (one previous visit may have been an aberration, I hope).  Turns out I had been running the kitchen staff ragged with my unintentional (App placed) orders for side dishes that they had not been prepared to offer.  They generally only offer two sides per evening, which changes each night, and instead of telling me ""sorry but we don't have that"" when I arrive for pick up, they've been whipping them up for me.PSS - I appreciate that they have read my review and have responded well to the good and the bad.  It shows that they care.  (Btw, those orders were placed by app, not by phone.)> Everyone was in the mood for Italian and our 1st and 2nd choice restaurants were booked. So that lead us to quaint little TreMonte. It was not crowded on a Thursday night and we were seated right away.We ordered meatball appetizers to start off with. They were good. I ordered their linguine with shrimp special, hubby ordered chicken parm, and our daughter ordered pink penne.  We all agreed the penne was amazing. Service was quick, drinks were never empty and our server was very friendly and helpful.> Great location, make reservations, upscale, quiet, good for business. We had calamari, excellent, veal saltimboca and Alfredo pasta, really good. Nice Chianti.  Service couldn't be better.  And oh the cannolis are fabulous and not to be missed.  A new favorite in the North End.  WeUbered from Hilton at Logan, 15 min.","5, 4, 4, 4, 4"
Chalawan,Cambridge,4.5,Null,Yes,Null,Yes,thechalawan.com,"Thai, Indonesian, Singaporean",12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,12:00 pm - 9:00 pm,Null,Null,"I feel like there's a lot of tasty Thai restaurants in Boston but Chalawan is the first that I've been to here that truly feels upscale. While this experience may come with a hefty price tag , I feel like it can be justified with Chalawan's impressive presentation of its food and its savory dishes. I don't think you can come to Chalawan and not order an appetizer considering how INSTAGRAM-ABLE  (and delicious) they are. My friend and I ordered the chicken betel leaf and the seared Alaskan scallop for our apps. The chicken betel leaf was an interesting experience. It has a strong lemon grass flavor with a bit of a mushy texture that is complemented by crunchy fried shallots. I would not recommend eating the actual betel leaf.The seared Alaskan scallop was every bit as delicious as it sounds. The scallop was seared perfectly, and I really enjoyed the garnish of scallion and shallots. I feel like this is going to be a must-order for me when I come back.For our mains, we got the red curry duck (with some roti canai) and the Singapore chili beef. The red curry duck was creamy with just the right amount of spice and kick. It was intriguing to see the combination of ingredients in this dish. I've never eaten a red curry with duck before much less one with lychee, okra, and eggplant, but it seemed to work. I was also glad that my friend and I both got rice for the red curry even though I'm kinda on a low carb diet . The rice was surprisingly good. It was warm and very sticky  which made it pleasing to eat. We also actually ordered the roti canai which came out fresh and hot and paired well with the curry (NOTE that it seems like they normally don't give you a curry/dipping sauce when you order the roti canai).The Singapore chili beef was admittedly kinda plain (like any nice beef dish you might find at a Chinese restaurant) but I still enjoyed eating it. The biggest reason you might not want to go to Chalawan is honestly the price. All the apps start to add up and even the rice costs $2 per person which is disappointing. I believe our bill came out to around $38 per person before tip All in all though, I think you get what you pay for. I would love to come back to Chalawan again in the future (perhaps on a fancy date) and try some of their other dishes.> I really enjoyed Chalawan but it was a bit tricky to understand what we were getting ourselves into.  Full disclosure: it was a rainy, icky Tuesday night and we were craving Southwest Asian food.  The Web site wasn't super helpful (and it was impossible to find prices listed to get any directional sense), so it was a bit surprising to us that entrees are about $30.  Totally understood but in that case we may not have gone on a rainy night where we just wanted comfort food (and instead dropped about $100).The food at Chalawan is delicious, nuanced, and fresh.  The food was a bit overpriced for what it was -- $25 - $30 for many of the entrees - again, it was impossible to know this before literally going into the restaurant.  Meanwhile, the ""Vegetarian"" menu on Chalawan's Web site is a bit lower ($15-$20) - just seemed misleading.> This was a wonderful meal. I really loved all the flavors, the presentation of the food and the set up of the restaurant were gorgeous, and the service was attentive as well.We started with the chicken betel leaf. It packs a flavorful punch, with a mix of herbs. It's really unique, and I highly recommend it.If you're getting a curry, I highly recommend getting the roti canai with it. The roti is wonderfully fluffy, and almost feels like it's made to be dipped.I got the red duck curry, along with jasmine rice. There's a lot of duck and a lot of curry. It's well worth the price. If there's extra curry, you can ask a server to pack it up and save it for another time.I recommend this restaurant without hesitation. It could be a really nice place for a date.> Overpriced and overhyped. Coming from NYC, I have pretty high expectations for Southeast Asian food. All the reviews say everything was delicious but my friends and I tried a bunch of their dishes and were only impressed with one: the Sumartra beef cheek rendang. Is it worth $32 though for a tiny portion? Definitely not.Given that there are not many Southeast Asian options in Boston as there are in New York, I can understand why this place gets so much hype. However, I wouldn't come back again because every other dish was either too salty (the seared scallop appetizer, priced at $4 EACH!), too sticky (the crispy comfit pork hock), or just flat out tasteless and mushy (the black sticky rice dessert).Save your money and go somewhere else.> When you ask the waitress how spicy a dish is and she says ""well to me it's not that spicy"", that's a good sign in a Southeast Asian place. Chalawan is perhaps the only Southeast Asian place in the Boston/Cambridge area that has an upscale, date-night feel with a variety of strong, beautiful flavors that does not shy away from the origins of their dishes. I would recommend making a reservation as the space is not huge. I ended up giving them a call to get my reservation because the online platform said they were fully booked. Overall, the service was very friendly and attentive, in a more dimly lit atmosphere for dinner, hence a nice-occasion feel. The rice is ordered ""per person"" and a waiter comes around with rice in the same fashion as one might expect with water, to fill up when they see you're running low. We ordered the scallops, chili beef, and red curry of duck. I like that the flavors were unique but did not feel hapharzardly combined. If you are wary of spice level, I would let the waiter know, as I get the feeling there is pride in spiciness here. There were many other options with intriguing combos that I want to try, so I'll definitely be back.","5, 4, 4, 2, 4"

Especially on a sunny day, the open kitchen / concept gave the whole place a really pleasant, more upscale ambiance. My party was seated promptly, and the servers were very attentive throughout our meal. I was particularly excited to try Bar Mezzana because I had heard so many great things about their crudo menu, and my friends and I were definitely not disappointed. We ordered the Nantucket Bay scallops, the shima aji, and the yellowtail. The fish was all super fresh and had such a luxurious mouthfeel, and the seasonings complimented each dish so well. We also ordered the whitefish and eggplant crostinis, which of course were also super tasty. My friends and I had a really great dining experience here and are so looking forward to coming back to try the cocktails / dinner menu!> Great experience here. Ambiance is upscale and dishes are priced as such but the food is goooood. Came here for a nice dinner with family and the booth and round table was comfy. We had lots of appetizers and especially loved the scallop crudo. Meatballs were also delicious. The real star of the show here is the pastas. I HIGHLY recommend lobster paccheri. You will be able to finish a large plate alone because it is just that good. Everyone seemed pleased with their pasta choices and my cousin noted that all pastas were cooked ""perfectly al dente."" All of us were too full for dessert but I won't skip it next time I go. Service was attentive but not overbearing and all cocktails we ordered tasted great.> Crudo & Pasta two of my fav foods. We arrived at 7P Thursday with no res and was able to snag two bar seats.Started off with cocktails - delish, can't go wrong with any of them. The complimentary bread was delicious. We shared the yellowtail and salmon crudo as well as the Orrechiete. Everything was phenomenal. Both crudos were fresh AF, however comes to 4 small pieces of fish per order. There are so many crudos and pastas to try I'm coming back. They have a $52pp family tasting menu that seems to be more bang for your buck if you're hungry!4 stars for the price point. Delicious food though.> The Yelp Elite had a community meet-up here right before the holidays, and it was quite a memorable experience. We ended up having about 20 people show up (maybe more) throughout the evening to give you an idea of the size of the group. Management was not only able to accommodate us throughout the evening, adding more space and tables to ensure we all had somewhere to rest our elbows or drinks, but the servers made sure that everyone was taken care of as if we were regulars or a private party. Nothing was missed, messed up, or charged incorrectly the entire night which really impressed me given the size of the party and the food that constantly streamed out. Even after a few appetizers I had prepared to have an entree. I decided on the octopus lumache and have to report that I am 100% happy I made that decision. The combination of creamy (but spicy) fra diavolo sauce, tender octopus, and noodles that were cooked to perfection gave me just the warmth I needed on a cold night. This was one of the more perfect pasta dishes I've had in the city. We also had a myriad of apps come out for us to share. Among the memorable were the following:      - Eggplant crostini (tangy, creamy, perfectly balanced)     - Pork Belly (rich, perfectly rendered and crisp, not pretentious)     - House pickles (light, crispy, refreshing) and olivesI'll be bringing the wife back with me, probably before (or after) we head to Shore Leave for drinks. However, until then I'll be having dreams of the lumache alla vodka and all that tender octopus strewn throughout the perfectly cooked noodles.> Really great service! We were a group of about 20 people and we had about 2-3 people checking in on us often, making sure water was filled and drinks and food kept flowing. They have a full bar and was super accommodating in making drinks not featured on the menu. For apps I tried the ricotta and eggplant crostini and they were both packed with flavor and great size for sharing. Overall great experience; I will definitely be back to explore their menu fully! #2019 Yelp 100 challenge: review 100!","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

We've eaten here a few times at the restaurant but recently it's been all takeout and the quality has stayed very consistent. It's a small restaurant and gets quite busy at lunch time during the week, but I promise it's worth the try. They have a pretty good size menu with a variety of options including a few different specials, combination platters and even some breakfast choices. Our go to Mexican dishes are carne asada tacos and salsa verde enchiladas with chicken. So naturally we had to try them here and haven't looked back. They're both served with rice and refried beans that are to die for. Recently we've even ordered a large refried beans on the side just to have for later because they're pretty good. The asada tacos have tender pieces of asada steak, with excellent flavor, topped with onion and cilantro for that authentic touch. The verde enchiladas come either mild or spicy and the spice goes perfect with the dish. My only critique is I wish they put a little more of the salsa verde as much of it gets absorbed by the tortillas, which are also homemade and to die for. They have 3 different salsas that they bring out with the entrees as well, and the 2 green ones are pretty spicy but have such good flavor. Overall we have had really great experiences here and look forward to continue enjoying their Mexican food while we live in Boston.> I walked in on a saturday around 7pm and ordered carry out, the wait was 10 minutes, i was pretty impressed.  i ordered the fillet of fish, large menudo soup, and a horchata.the filet fish was not breaded and i believe deep fried.  it was perfectly cooked, mild in flavors, and very tasty.  the rice that accompanied it was also mildly flavored and really good.  the menudo was flavorful, slightly spicy, and it's definitely a warm comfort soup.  there were generous pieces of tripe in the soup.  the horchata was tasty, the cinnamon hits you upfront followed by its sweetness.  it wasn't overtly sweet which is what i prefer.there's so much more i like to try on their menu that i'll be coming back.  the place is tiny, five wooden booths.  the parking is hard on this block as it shares its space with multiple businesses nearby.> Hands down the best Mexican Hole in the Wall in Eastie. Definitely a staple for me! && I bring my parents here every time they're in town to visit bc they too love this place! I always have a though time choosing between Carne Asada or Mariscos a la diabla. Both are fantastic!The homemade sauces are also soo good. They give you chips and salsa with 4 different sauces when you dine in and it only gets better from there.One down side is there's a bit of a wait, but what good places don't?!?? It's always worth the wait. Please don't ever go away!> DINNER REVIEWTaco bout a great find!I came to Taqueria Jalisco on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Eastie and boy am I glad I did. I just got back from a week-long trip to Mexico and I have to say...these tacos were better than any tacos I had in Mexico.They were full of juicy, flavorful meat (I had one chicken, one steak, and one marinated pork) and topped with cilantro and onion. The steak was my favorite but they were all good. Then you have the option of one of their three multi-colored salsa (green, brown, yellow) with varying degrees of spiciness to add to your tacos (none were too spicy for me but those who don't like spice should stick to the green). The rice and beans that came with it were also great.I also had a pork tamale which was a good tamale but I think the tacos were still my favorite.The place is tiny so you may have to wait a bit for a table (we waited 5 minutes only) and the service is great (the servers are so nice!). You can easily get FULL for under $20 which is great too.I will definitely be back.> On the coldest night during our weekend trip to Boston, my boyfriend and I got a sudden hankering for tacos. I am so glad we shuffled into Taqueria Jalisco.The taqueria, albeit small (about 6 tables and a bar area) was cozy and warm. Service was friendly and fast. The menu consisted of Jalisco regional food as well as conventional Tex-Mex fare. After we ordered, we received complimentary chips and salsa -- both were fresh and delicious. We also received a platter of three house hot sauces to accompany our meals.I ordered a grilled steak taco and a carnitas taco, the latter of which was the best taco I have ever had. The generous helpings of meat were juicy, seasoned perfectly, and coupled with the right amount of onion, cilantro, and lime. We also ordered both of the tamales on the menu -- typically, I stay away from tamales because of their tendency to be dry, but both kinds of tamales here were moist and delicious. Overall, we had an excellent experience and left full, energized, and happy.","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"

Think of the drool emoji.. that was me the whole meal. Everything was well above average, from the atmosphere and the friendliness of the wait staff, to the quality of ingredients and flavors of the dishes- definitely deserves a full 5 stars.This is a place you go if you want to impress your Hinge date or have something special to celebrate. It's a little more on the dressy side when it comes to attire in the dining area (IMO) but they have a bar area with TVs if you're feeling casual. I love any excuse to dress up so I enjoyed the feel.Special sushi rolls are a little on the pricier side but you're getting your money's worth with fresh, quality ingredients, sufficient portions, and nice presentation. We picked the Miss Waldorf roll which was all of my favorite things in a roll- I would go back just for that! The Wagyu Beef Fried Rice was a nice filler that I split with my date. The meat was flavorful and tender and the entree was a pretty generous portion. Good sake and sangria. Great Calamari. Wondering how fast I can get back.> This is probably one one of my new favorite places in Boston, granted if  you're willing to  shell out some money for a good pan Asian/Japanese meal. Fuji has multiple locations, including Ink Block in South End and Assembly  Row. I frequent Whole Foods and the turnstyle cycling studio next to this place and have been wanting  to try Fuji for a long time.The service was excellent as we were seated promptly and greeted by our waiter on a Sunday evening for dinner. We ordered spicy tempura maki, mango avocado, volcano maki, salt and pepper shrimp, xo beef udon, deboned chicken, and veggie fried rice (a party of 4 this visit so we did family style this time). All of these dishes were cooked to perfection with rich flavor. My personal favorite was the beef udon, as it had a somewhat burnt but great taste to it making it unique. The chicken was also my second favorite as it was tender and really mixed in well with the veggies.  Overall, I'll be back to Fuji. Giving this a five star review, this is officially in my top 5 places to eat in Boston. Such great food, friendly service, and memorable dishes. However be ready to shell out some money on your dinner but it will be a  great treat!!> Wow. Really fun night with my wife and another couple. Food was excellent and really nice staff and atmosphere. My friend made reservations which Is probably a must for more than 2. My wife is also pregnant and they had a bunch of options available. We started with wings, potstickers and lobster Rangoon. All were awesome. So sushi: I deferred to my friends who actually ate at the omakese table about a year ago. We got a mix of maki ranging from standard yellowtail to the volcano roll. All were amazing. Then we were about to order a couple more but deferred to the waitress for input. She recommended the toro sashimi. We got the salmon, tuna and yellowtail. All were awesome. I cant say that enough. The salmon was my top. My wife got the chicken udon which she really liked but was pretty jealous once we started raving about the sushi.. we felt bad but kept eating..Will go back once my wife can have some sushi! Be prepared to spend a good amount but wasn't unreasonable for the amount of food we got and the competition in the area.> Duke here at this moment. Food is delicious. This is our go-to Japanese sushi sashimi in Boston. See the pictures. The service is always exceptional. Today, mid January, we were helped by Gabriel, a male server. In early December, on a afternoon, by Jane. Both are great. Highly recommend them. Pleasant experience.> Been to Fuji a few times and their sushi and maki rolls have consistently remained fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. Restaurant looks a bit upscale but tends to have a more casual vibe. Good selection of drinks and plenty of table and bar seating. Service has always been friendly and great. Great spot for special celebrations!","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

Their menu is not super extensive like other Italian restaurants in the North End, but they have all my the essentials (in my opinion). Great meatballs, fresh salad, delicious bolognese, and their homemade mozzarella sticks are everything I wished I had in college. The decor reminds me of what you might find in an Long Island Italian family's finished basement- red and white checkered tablecloths, dim lighting, pro sports and Ferrari posters on the walls, chianti bottles everywhere. It's comfortable and unpretentious and makes you want to stay a while. The staff are very friendly and efficient. The upstairs isn't huge, but they have a downstairs dining area with bigger tables for large groups. One of my favorite Italian spots in Boston!> If the pasta wasn't undercooked and clumped together  I would give this place a 4 star.  The meatballs were really flavorful and we loved the mozz sticks . The calamari was good , but nothing out of the ordinary special . I was bummed because I was craving Italian food and would have gone to a place where I know I get good Italian ( and prob for cheaper) . But I'm going to give this place another chance and pray that the pasta is cooked better !> This was my first step into the North End! I loved it! We made a reservation, I honestly think you need a reservation anywhere you go in the North End. The service was great, all of our food came out relatively fast. The server really knew his wine a lot about the dishes. We were pretty indecisive but he helped us out!The food pasta was amazing, I had cacio e pepe and it was fantastic! The garlic bread was a bit chewy and luke warm, which was a disappointment. We also had the calamari that was just as good. The wine selection was great!Definitely will go back.> My husband and I were looking for a last minute dinner spot after we landed in Boston. Our options were limited since it was after 9:30 pm and many of the restaurants surrounding our hotel were starting to shut down. After a quick glance at the Yelp app we decided on Tony & Elaine's. Despite arriving so close to closing time we were warmly greeted by the restaurant. Their only request was for us to be finished by 10:30pm. This worked for us since our toddler's bedtime was approaching!The bolognese is to die for at Tony & Elaine's! This might be the best bolognese I have ever had, including the bolognese we ate in Florence, Italy. My son usually doesn't care for pasta, but he absolutely loved this dish! My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana. This massive dish includes a huge portion of chicken parmigiana and rigatoni pasta that could have easily fed both of us. I personally thought the dish was a bit boring, but my husband was happy with his chicken.Our meal was so good that it was tempting to return the following night. Will definitely return here next time we visit Boston!> DINNER REVIEWCame here with a friend at 7 PM on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation and even got there a little early but they were still able to seat us immediately which I appreciated it.SETTING: Red and white checkerboard tablecloth place. Definitely feels old school Italian, especially if you sit downstairs with the low ceilings, dim lighting, and exposed brick walls.SERVICE: Friendly and attentive. Nothing negative.FOOD:They start you out with this thick focaccia bread which you can dip in olive oil. Great start!My friend and I had heard good things about the meatballs so we got those as an appetizer. I was expecting these HUGE meatballs but they were just 3 medium sized meatballs. Some of the best meatballs I've had and the sauce was delicious and definitely made in house. Fortunately, we saved some bread to sop up all the deliciousness.For our entrees, we decided to share two entrees: the Chicken Parmesan and the Mushroom Risotto. The Chicken Parm was HUGE (see the picture) and it came with two large breaded breasts. They were slightly on the dry side but they were breaded well and like I said above, the red sauce is great. The mushroom risotto was good, not great. Nothing to write home about. Definitely overall a great Italian meal but I still would like to check out some other spots in the North End before coming back.","5, 3, 4, 5, 4"

Stan is a gem!We enjoyed a dozen of east coast oysters, as well as a dozen of the west coast oysters - so fresh!!I had one of the nightly specials - petite 6 Oz filet and sea scallops with bearnaise. I ordered my steak MR and it came out medium but couldn't complain because it was still such a great cut of meat. Great wine selection..the Italian Amarone paired so well with this dish. Thank you Stan for ensuring this was a great experience.> I was not expecting much when I came here... thought it was just going to be a typical new American cuisine with seafood... nothing special right? Boy was I wrong! To begin... my sisters and I made a reservation here to celebrate my mom's birthday. The menu is quite unique and offer a lot of dishes that excite my tastebuds! I honestly did not know what to order and I did not have the chance to look at Yelp. However, the smoking seafood tower caught my eye and knew we had to order this. We all love seafood and why not order something special for a special occasion? The tower is valued at market price and I believe it varies depending on how many people is in your party. It turned out to be $180 for four servings. Our family of five does not eat a lot in general, so we ordered three entrees (the daily special - halibut with lobster risotto, 8 oz filet mignon, and rack of lamb), house salad, and one of their popular sides (smoked gouda tator tots) to share.The Smoking Seafood Tower - This came with oysters (bottom tier), a whole lobster and crab legs (second tier), shrimp cocktail (top tier), and crab meat (tippy top tier). I was not expecting to be getting this much seafood, so it was a very pleasant surprise. Each tier had their own sauce to dip the seafood in. To be honest, I didn't dip it in the sauces so that I could enjoy the natural taste of the seafood, which was there. The seafood was so fresh, juicy, and sweet. By far one of the best seafood I've had in a while at a restaurant. The lobster was cooked perfectly and was cut for us, so all we had to do was use a fork to pick at it. They gave us melted butter on the side (please refer to the pictures) in these cute holders, which was quite unique. Overall, I highly recommend this tower. You will not be disappointed and I thought it was very worth the price we paid!Ocean Club House Salad - This salad came with romaine, field greens, granny smith apples, goat cheese, walnuts, and sherry mustard vinaigrette. This was a very well dressed salad and so refreshing! The second I read the description of this salad, I knew I had it get it. I highly recommend.Smoked Gouda Tater Tots - WOW best tater tots I've ever had...and this has me craving for more days later. Each tater tot is filled with cheese, so dipping it in the sauce it not necessary, unless you like a super salty and cheesy tater tot. This is a MUST try.Halibut with Lobster Risotto - I apologize if I am getting this wrong, but I know it was definitely halibut with risotto and lobster. Either way, I highly recommend ordering this if it happens to be one of their daily specials again. This is by far one of the best risotto I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly with the seafood taste that we all love. No words can describe how great this was... you just need to try this for yourself. The halibut was cooked perfectly too... I have never had fish that was cooked so perfectly like this. Definitely set some high expectations for my taste buds now.8 oz Filet Mignon - This dish was the most plain looking out of everything we ordered, but don't let this fool you - the steak was seasoned perfectly and it literally melted in my mouth. We asked for medium rare and it was exactly the way I like my steak. I will order this again!Colorado Lamb - This came with two double cut chops, English peas, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. To be honest, this was probably the least favorite dish of the night due to the fact that we got really fatty pieces of lamb and it was under cooked. We asked for medium rare as that is usually the chef's recommendation, but perhaps we should've ordered medium. We ended up asking to get this packed up, since we were pretty full already. The sauce was good nonetheless and it had the amazing lamb taste that I love (for the pieces that I was able to eat).Ten Layer Carrot Cake - I usually do not opt for carrot cakes, but it really appealed to me that night, so we got it. The cake was so moist and flavorful without it being too sweet. I devoured my 1/4 of a slice so quick. This is worth the hype!Creme Brulee - What a big portion this was! I've had creamier creme brulee, but this was still very good. I will probably order something else next time though. Maybe the carrot cake just won me over.The service was AMAZING - our waiter was so friendly and so welcoming. I forgot his name, but he honestly did a great job and was tentative throughout the night. Even the food runners were amazing. I cannot wait to be back here. I believe they had live music going on as well, but I couldn't see from where I was sitting. Ocean Prime hits all the marks for me!> Wow I don't even know where to begin with this place. First time here and  will definitely be back despite the lack of service here. My friends and I made reservations for 5:45p.m on a Friday night.

They were too busy trying to teach one another Spanish. Ok anyways, the rest of my party arrive and we were later able to be seated. We sat down all the way to the back of the restaurant. It wasn't too  busy but the back of the restaurant where they sat us was literally empty before we got there. As soon as we sat down about four waiters walked over and introduced themselves and one after another asked to start us off with some drinks. We were a little confused at first as this showed poor communication on their end but we slowly but surely got our drinks. It was a little frustrating knowing that four serves came up to tell us they would be serving us but no one was around when we wanted to order. We weren't too frustrated at first because my girls kept me company. But later we had to flag one of our serves down in order to get another drink and to fill up our glasses with water. Once our food came out, our food looked amazing... once we all had a bit of everything we knew we would be coming back. The food literally shut us up. No more conversations for a good 10 minutes. All we did was talk about how amazing each dish was. We started off with the chop chop salad, Parmesan fries, black pepper Mac and cheese. Then came out the rib eye steak, ny strip, and grilled shrimp..then we finished it with espresso martinis and the 10 layered cake which was phenomenal!!!! Despite the lack of service we got here the food made up for it, if not more.> I'll start by saying that I came here for a business luncheon. I was shown to a room in the back and was delighted when I found out people were ordering ""real"" drinks! Fancyyy! I had an espresso martini and it came out creamy and sweet.We started with caesar salads. The croutons were a bit mushy, but I liked that there were little parmesan chips mixed in. It really added some nice flavor and crunch. For the main course, I got a filet - medium rare. The cook was perfect and it was just the right amount for lunch. It came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The dessert was an extremely large chocolate peanut butter cake. It came out a bit cold, but not frozen. It was the perfect temp for it not to melt all over the place. The cake was rich, decadent and delicious. I had the rest packed up to go.Also, the service was amazing! If someone came late, the staff swooped over with salad and took main course orders. Water and iced tea glasses were continuously refilled throughout the luncheon/presentation. Plates were cleared with minimal fuss or distraction.I would definitely come back here on my own. Food and service were great!> A good steakhouse and the vibe is pretty cool at this location. Reservations definitely recommended. The bar was packed both times I went-- it's a bit of a scene (in a good way). There's also usually live music playing everyone's favorites. Their cocktails are surprisingly good, you can't beat the theatre of the blueberry one that arrives bubbling with dry ice. I've had the 6oz filet both times I went and while it's delicious, I never manage to finish it because I'm full of sides. The creamed spinach side is basically delicious spinach dip, and the truffle mac and cheese is deeply decadent. Our table was debating between sharing a loaded baked potato or a twice baked potato when the server suggested getting loaded mashed potatoes. It was the perfect solution. For additional wow factor, try to save room for dessert. There's a ten layer carrot cake on the menu and we ordered it -- for science, of course-- and confirmed there are indeed TEN LAYERS of cake on this towering masterpiece.","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"
