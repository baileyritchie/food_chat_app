Between two people we ordered the fat cheeks tray ($26) with pulled chicken, sliced brisket, and pork ribs. We paid a little extra ($1 or so) to substitute the cold scoop for a hot scoop, and got the mac and cheese and the BBQ beans. We also got the bucket of biscuits ($14) which came with four huge biscuits and a super tasty honey butter.They have house-made sauces at each table which go great with the food. They have a BBQ sauce, a vinegar, and a very spicy habanero sauce. I loved combining the BBQ sauce with the habanero.The biscuits were incredible! Super buttery and flaky, and they went well with everything. They can also be ordered individually at $4 a biscuit but I don't know if it comes with the honey butter.The BBQ beans had an awesome flavor and the texture was good. Not too soft but still cooked thoroughly.The mac and cheese was my favorite! It came with a super crispy and fragrant topping that pulled everything together. Even if it didn't have the crispy topping, the sauce was very cheesy and creamy.I felt that the pulled chicken was a bit too salty and was a little dry. The meat on the ribs fell beautifully off of the bone, but was on the plainer side so I dipped it in a lot of sauce. The brisket was tender and juicy-- definitely my favorite out of the three.The fat cheeks tray and bucket of biscuits ended up being way too much food for the two of us! We were stuffed and took the leftovers to go.I am still interested in giving their other meats a chance, but I will be coming back for their lunch menu where you can get a tray of their sides!> Meh? The food looks great, but fell VERY short on flavor. Even the sauces on the table were not exciting. Seriously disappointed, particularly given the price we paid. Potato salad - it was German potato salad. I hate German potato salad. Wish the menu mentioned i wouldn't be getting standard potato salad so I wouldn't waste my money. Pickles -  basically no flavor. Crunchy, but definitely not pickles, more like slightly vinegary veggies. Biscuits - good, but a fairly standard biscuit. The honey buttery was nice, but still made for just a good biscuit. Guess it says something that this is the menu item they're known for. I mean, you're a BBQ joint and you're known for biscuits? Meats - we tried sausage (bland) and both kinds of brisket (fatty). Tried adding table sauces to help with the flavor and they didn't really help. Mac and cheese- probably our favorite part of the meal. Cute presentation in a fun metal mug.I don't think it's worth your time or money. Try BBQ elsewhere.> Came here without a reservation on a Friday night. The hostess was super rude and didn't even seem to care nor acknowledge our presence. Furthermore, when we inquired about the wait, she seemed super annoyed for some reason. There were multiple open tables and seats by the bar and she kept saying it was only for reservations even though there were tons of open seats. Regardless, the food and waitress made me forget this horrid experience with the hostess behind the tablet.Ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the biscuits. The biscuits were SO YUMMY. They are very big, fluffy, buttery, ginormous, and just melt in your mouth. I always cut it in half and slobber it with butter as its just so big. Biscuits are a must-get here as you probably already know.The buttermilk fried chicken comes with a cold side and a hot side. I got cole slaw and mac and cheese. Cole slaw was fine, mac and cheese was good and comes in a mug. The fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've had in any restaurant (may change once I visit the South). The skin is super crispy and deep-fried perfectly. The chicken is juicy and cooked perfectly.Also, the hostess was super friendly and attentive. Thank god.Will come again as this is probably the best Southern food in Boston. Make reservations too!> DINNER REVIEWI THINK I DIED AND WENT TO FRIED CHICKEN AND BISCUITS HEAVEN.After moving to Boston from the South where I was used to biscuits, BBQ, and fried chicken galore, I had been searching for a place to have really good southern food. I think (nay, I know) I've found it at Sweet Cheeks. If you don't know Tiffani Faison, she's a Top Chef finalist who owns several restaurants in the Fenway area (Tiger Mama is another one of my favorites of hers). Sweet Cheeks was her first restaurant and boy am I glad I finally went.The place has a really lively, fun atmosphere with cool decor, TVs playing, and a picture of a nearly naked Burt Reynolds in the men's bathroom. It's a great place to go have a fun dinner with friends.And I haven't even gotten to the food!My friends and I started off with the Bucket O' Biscuits which come with 4 HUGE biscuits and some delicious honey butter to spread on them. They are crispy on the outside and warm and buttery on the inside. Some of the best I've ever had. One is enough for each person, especially if you are going to get one of the platters.Then I ordered the Fried Chicken because I had heard such good things about it and WOW! Just look at that picture. That is a full half chicken (and BIG pieces of half chicken) fried perfectly crispy but moist in the middle. I got it with a hot shake (spicy seasoning) and got jalapeno ranch on the side to take it up a notch. I will be back solely for the chicken. But the sides (or as they call them, scoops) are delicious as well. I would have eaten buckets of that mac n cheese and the coleslaw provided a nice acidic contrast to the very heavy and hearty chicken and mac n cheese. That's also why they give you pickles and onions.For the price, the portion sizes are HUGE! I can't wait to come back and try their BBQ too.> I came with a friend on a weekday evening. The restaurant was very empty, so we were quickly seated. We ordered a bucket of biscuits to share, and I ordered a prime beef brisket sandwich for myself. The biscuits were so flaky and light! The honey butter was AMAZING! It was so sweet and delicious that I couldn't get enough! The prime beef brisket sandwich was quite delicious. There was a good portion of fatty beef on the sandwich, which I was very happy about! The flavor was really delicious and smoky. Overall, I was very pleased with our dinner. I do think that $14 is pretty steep for 4 biscuits and a small cup of honey butter, but it tasted really good.","4, 3, 4, 5, 4"

The food was absolutely devine! My friend's plate came out first and while we were waiting for mine, I thought I was going to start drooling just from looking at it. The smell was heavenly and the taste was superb! I also liked that the menu has unique combinations, for example pork belly with nectarines, pesto and Gorgonzola. It sounds weird,  but it was amazing (and probably the only 6000 calories per plate that are really worth sweating it at the gym).You should make reservations, we didn't make any and the wait was ~40 minutes. We were lucky to spot 2 seats at the bar, made the order and it came out very quickly.Will definitely come back for more!> For sure they are welcoming to the older crowd, saw it first hand, so if you are over 60, prolly avoid the joint. The bar is an amazing place, sizable, dark, and richly appointed but not in a ""club"" manner, more like New Orleans meets Vietnam meets France kind of thing.The host desk, which is separated from the  bar and the dining room (I think to try to screen people a bit) was blaring some uninteresting ""lil"" choose your favorite gangster wanna-be-hip-hop idiot.  That was remarkable, actually as usually these places are a bit more PC.But whatevs, the food here trumps it all.  It was super good, from the pita, to the octopus, we tried quite a bit, and all super good.My pro-tip is to come here with a bunch of high energy people and just let it hang out, Order a bunch of stuff, drink like a fish, and then just to cap off the orgy of indulgence, order the giant $45 baked alaska, Memories made...> Amazing food.Service/Managerial concern? Leaves much to be desired.  Had a delicious meal there with a friend last week. Table next to us spilled their red wine ALL OVER me and my shit, my freshly dry-cleaned winter jacket, my work backpack, ass of my jeans. Not only was the spiller not mortified/offer to buy us a round/offer dry cleaning, our server handed me 2 kitchen rags to clean up the mess. Um, WHAT? I'm in charge of clean up for the table next to us who just spilled red wine all over me and my shit in the middle of dinner? What's even worse is that I have yet to receive a response to the non-aggressive email I sent the day after providing feedback and asking Yvonne's for help.When there are so many excellent restaurants in Boston, you may as well go somewhere that gives a shit about their customers.> Wow! From the street i wasn't sure what to expect. But once inside this place is massive and has so much character. It's a very posh speakeasy with their own take on classic cocktails. I had the Churn and Burn (think bourbon Old Fashion) it was great. The gin and tonic looked very colorful and yummy too. We had some small plates that were quite tasty.> I come here at least twice a month!!! Reservations are a must if you're coming here Friday -Sunday. Perfect for two people or big groups! Came here for the first time for my birthday and been coming back ever since because the drinks here are quality and food is shareable (tapas).There are small appetizers, pita breads, and also larger plate appetizers! There are also set large meals for bigger parties, which include a lot of food (so you need to have a large party for that) Favs: hummus, pork belly pita, fried shrimpDrinks: they have a wide variety of wines and cocktails. I love their special gin and tonic. This place is def on the pricier side, especially the small tapas!! At times, the servers can be a little bit rude depending on the day, not sure why some people are not very friendly. I think for some reason, they're nicer if you are a regular or have been there before.","5, 4, 2, 5, 4"
Tasty Pot,Boston,4,2,No,Null,Yes,tastypotusa.com,"Hot Pot, Bubble Tea, Taiwanese",11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,11:00 am - 10:45 pm,11:00 am - 10:45 pm,11:00 am - 9:45 pm,Null,Null,"Really good! I went here as part of a Yelp Elite event. I loved the set-up that they had. I decided to get the lamb hot soup, which came out in a heated bowl, so the soup stayed warm. They had a few sauces that I could add to the soup. I loved that the soup came with so many different components in it, so I could try a variety of things and never get sick of anything. One of my favorite things in the soup was the tofu. I also got a bubble tea, which was really good! They had a lot of variety, but I would definitely recommend also getting one. I would definitely go back, and I'd love to try some of the different soups.> Awesome take on hot pot! I ordered the Beef Hot Soup, and my boyfriend had the Curry Hot Soup. You specify the spice level and then you choose either vermicelli noodles or rice to come on the side. Just note, it's an actual side of rice and not rice noodles as I originally thought (oops!).  Everything is already cooked when it comes out to you, which I love versus traditional hot pot because I usually am too impatient to wait to cook my food. I also just like how it's so easy to choose what bowl you want instead of having to pick the toppings on your own, which can be tricky if you don't get the right combination. Unlike a couple of other reviews, I didn't have a problem with how much cabbage was in mine. I thought it was just the right amount in addition to so many other toppings! I loved the variety - fish balls, crab meats, taro, fried tofu skin, etc. They definitely did not skimp. I thought the portion size was perfect and left me feeling fully satisfied. For dessert, we ordered some of their drinks. I had the Milk Creme Black Tea and my boyfriend ordered the Rose Matcha Latte with Boba. I was completely obsessed with the milk cap - it was slightly salty but sweet at the same time and creamy, which paired amazingly with the black tea which isn't as sweet. It was the perfect combination!Also, make sure to take advantage of their virtual wait list - makes everything so much easier. I will definitely be back.> I'm so happy this is here. Used to go to the one in Union City, CA. Everything tastes the same! The only difference was they don't have the membership award system (buy 10 get 1 free) and you had to pay for sha Cha sauce and Szechuan sauce $1/ea (was free in CA)But unlimited broth... winner. They use the beef broth to add no matter what soup you use (I think) so grab that sha Cha sauce, order chopped fresh garlic, green onions and use it as your dip for your meat and soup... sides vary from $1.75 (rice) , $3.50/$4.50 (enoki mushroom, dumplings, fried tofu, etc...) to $5.50 (beef, lamb, stinky tofu) just got into Roe fish balls (drool)Don't forget to get their black tea cream boba drink. Good balance of sweetness and creaminess.A must try. Service is fast, friendly and delightful.Been here 4x already!!!! Always hits the (Tasty) sPOT!> I've been on the hunt for something similar to Boiling Point from Los Angeles in Boston - Tasty Pot does not meet my expectations. The menu is quite extensive, offering about 12 or more soups. I found that each soup came with a lot of cabbage compared to anything else. Tasty Pot has a waitlist available on Yelp which allows customers to join the waitlist prior to arriving.> Really liked this place!The servings are HUGE definitely could be shared by 2 or people and they have milk tea. I got the taro tea and the seafood supreme and it was so amazing and my partner got the beef one and the beef was so flavorful. I love the dishes the food comes in they're like your own hot pot plates. Definitely would come back!","4, 5, 5, 2, 4"

The ambiance is mellow. They sometimes play hipster house music. Service can be hit or miss. Right in china town. Clean establishment. Parking really sucks to find.Lunch time before 3pm on weekdays is the business. The  jumbo or ""more"" portioned combo cost $22 instead of the dinner $32. Tom yum broth is very flavorful. Has that lemon grass spice, chili zing, and the sour. Miso is a good pair with it for the subtle not too strong flavor. I always get jumbo. The meat quality here is soo much better than other places. From the marbling to the cut, it's a nice treat. Melt in the mouth meat. Add ramen for extra $2. I highly recommend this spot . I'll come here every time. Not sure but the garlic chili flavor has changed. It doesn't taste garlic-y any more . Only difference from 4 years ago. Prices have been the same since 4 years ago. One of the many spots I love to come to.> I used to loveeeeeee Shabu-Zen. The food was great and the food is still really great. However, the boss don't take care of his customers. He's more about saving himself a couple of dollars from each customer. The food are already on the pricer side to begin with. It started with him taking away the free sweet bean soup at the end of the meal. Then took one piece of meat away from the boneless rib plate. They use to put 16 pieces on the plate and now it's only 15. He ordered his waiting staff to fluff the rice to make it look fuller. Also, now he don't offer bbq sauce or chopped chili from the start. It's only available upon requests. I don't think I will be coming back. I will take my business elsewhere. The boss don't value his customers, then I don't need to value his restaurant.> Good but standard hot pot.  Best part is the selection of broth options (Spicy Szechuan is my favorite).  Broth is $5 unless you get the complimentary house broth. Went for dinner and got the A5 prime beef ($16 for regular) which comes with some veggies (e.g., Bok choy, Napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, etc) and your choice of noodles (udon vs vermicelli) or rice. Service is friendly and fast.  Hot pot is served individually so easy to go with friends and each person can choose their own broth (great for those who have varying spice tolerances).  There are several hot pot choices in Chinatown and this is a good option, but certainly not a ""must go to"" spot.> Despite my family and I being regulars at this restaurant, I've never wrote a review here and I thought that it was time. We have a waiter that ended up coincidentally being our regular waiter every time we visited. My dad loves him and he's not a very easy person to please. Think stern hard-to-please asian dad. Our waiter would always bring out chopped red peppers (something they used to bring out when they first opened but don't anymore) and extra stuff to put in our sauce without asking. He'd come and greet us in Vietnamese, ask where my mom was whenever she doesn't come out to eat with me and my brother. It honestly always a please trip to Shabu-zen just because of our waiter (and food of course!!). We just oddly never gotten his name, but will update this review when I find out!Anyway!!! On to the food review part! Broth is always good! My family usually does half spicy Mongolian and half Chinese herbal. The broth is the reason why we don't go to the Allston location much. It's slightly different. Things we always get:A2. Prime Grade Boneless Short Rib (Jumbo)A11. Surf and Turf (My mom likes the seafoodFish Paste*** (personal FAV)Sauteed Baby ClamsSauteed Beef TongueRaw Beef TongueRice (it hits different here, trust)> Pros: The food is just simply bomb. My favorite broth to get is the Tom Yum and Kim-Chee because some places like Hot Pot Buffet or Spring-Shabu doesn't offer Tom Yum which is my favorite! Their prime rib eye/beef or prime grade short ribs will always be the best meats and it's great that each meat plate comes with a side of noodles/rice and veggies. I also recommend their sautéed beef tongue (my all time favorite place to eat sautéed beef tongue is Shabu-zen), and stuffed meatballs (don't knock it till you try it!). They also have their special soy sauce and it's fun mixing in the garlic, pepper, scallion, and bbq sauce to dip the food in!Service: The team of servers at Shabu-Zen have always been great and attentive. It's like they always knew when we needed something. Cons: The only con I have is that it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order or how many people the party is composed of. But it's worth every penny and to be expected because of the great quality. Also because it's located in Chinatown it's best to go in the evening where there are more parking spots and no need to pay for meters. Overall: Shabu-Zen has always been on my top list for hotpot spots in Boston. Every single time I've gone I was not disappointed by the food or the service.","5, 5, 2, 3, 5"
PABU Boston,Boston,4,3,Yes,Null,Yes,pabuizakaya.com,"Sushi Bars, Izakaya, Venues & Event Spaces",12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,12:00 pm - 8:00 pm,Closed,Null,Null,"PABU has proven to me that it not only deserves to be in the conversation with the best sushi restaurants in Boston, but as one of the premier dining experiences in the city.I actually got the idea for dining at PABU from a Travelzoo voucher that I got for my wife and myself on a whim. I had not heard of it prior to and after I got the voucher started researching the chef, location, and what dishes they were best known for. The menu is diverse and offers a lot of interesting dishes that can be easily split among a few or numerous people. There is also a very interesting menu of sushi that is exclusively imported from Japan (and immediate surrounding waters), giving diners the opportunity to enjoy the fares of the Japan without actually visiting. The sushi menu and small plates were where we settled on for our meal, having a more tasting-style approach to our dinner than getting bigger plates and only getting to try a few things. Oddly enough, the Tokyo Fried chicken was one of my least favorite dishes and I still REALLY liked it. There was nothing we had that wasn't perfectly prepared and presented to us at the chef's table (end of the sushi bar). Highlights of the meal were definitely the house-made tofu, maitake mushroom tempura, and the sashimi selections we made from the Japanese fish menu. From a price perspective, PABU is more than reasonable. Where some multi-course sushi experiences will run $150/person without drinks I think our total bill was under $200, including two drinks for each of us as well as tax and tip. The service and attention we got was exactly on par with what we expected. We were given the perfect amount of attention without feeling constantly interrupted or ignored, which I think they appreciated hearing when asked how our experience was outside of the food. PABU can easily fall into the special occasion kind of meal, but you can also be choosy and have a great meal for a more than reasonable tab. I think this will be added to the rotation for sushi as well as special occasion destinations going forward. They've proven to be a powerhouse in an already crowded sector and were able to wow the wife and I during our first visit.> Had high expectations for this restaurant but was far from impressed. We had a 7:30 reservation and waited 15 minutes to be seated, though there were at least a dozen open tables at the time we arrived. Nigiri was the skimpiest portion I have ever seen. We ordered the wagyu flank medium rare and it took one hour and fifteen minutes to come out. We asked the waiter what the hold us was and he said ""it takes 30 min to cook so it was really only 15 minutes late."" Good math!!?? When giving us the bill he ""sorry I know it's always feels like you're waiting forever when you're hungry! Next time you come back we can do a round of drinks on the house."" Definitely won't be returning because the food is mediocre at best, the comments were unwarranted, and there is a lack of care regarding customer experience. Waste of $300> you MUST try the homemade tofu here!! It's one of my favorite dishes! And over to my review... I came here to celebrate an anniversary - everything about staff to the food was all amazing. Our waiter was so sweet, made us some great recommendations and we had such a wonderful time here. We tried dishes from every category of the menu such as hot dishes, sushi, cold appetizers etc. I wanted to try everything. I can't wait to come back next time to order the tofu again, but also other delicious dishes! This is definitely a great spot for a date because it's located in downtown crossing and the environment is so chic. If you have larger parties, definitely book ahead in advance because usually the tables are organized for 2 to 4 people.> I came here for a date night based on Yelp reviews and you guys did not let me down! First of all, the decor is absolutely beautiful. The lighting is dark and romantic. The Happy Spoon is a must when you're here. We enjoyed all of the sushi and dumplings. Drinks were great as well. My only critique is that portions can be larger. I def want to try their Omakase next time - the couple next to our table had it and we were so impressed. We'll be back soon!> We decided to come back and experience Pabu outside of Restaurant Week. Two words: customer service!! The managers here are the best in the Boston restaurant scene. Not only are they on the ground running & present, their attention to detail to guests is admirable. You can tell that their love/passion for the restaurant goes beyond just the day to day operations, it's about building customer relationships and providing exceptional experience. They definitely made me a loyal customer. From the start, our host asked to take our coats and we were greeted by our waiter shortly. With every meal presentation, the waiter makes sure to describe the dish and comes to check on us quite regularly. As for the food, I cannot be happier. We ventured out and tried these:Local Oysters: 4/5 I mean, you can't really go wrong with oysters. I think we might have squeezed too much of the lemon so it was just a bit too sour and overwhelmed the actual oyster's taste. Delicious either way.Ikayaki Grilled Squid: 3.5/5 I would've really liked this if there were less burnt pieces. The middle section was better as you could really taste the squid but get the crispy grilled parts as well.Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: 5/5!! Musttttt get this. This is my favorite dish on the menu so far. The foie gras was seared so perfectly - sweet, distinct, fatty. The eel was paired absolutely beautiful with the crispy rice. This is one of those dishes that I'm going to crave for a long time.Milk Chocolate-Sesame Custard: 5/5 yumm. Everything about this I loved. If you like milk chocolate, sesame, and red bean, go for it. Great dish to share as well because you get a whole bowl's worth.Mochi Sundae: 3/5 not a fan of shaved ice usually so this didn't quite impress me. The tapioca and mochi flavors weren't quite there either. Overall, I'm definitely coming back again - happy hour I heard is the way to go","5, 2, 5, 4, 5"

What a gem this place is.  The location is perfect.  Cobblestones on the road will guide you to this old house turned to restaurant.  There are 4-5 rooms which hosts a small number of people, making it feel very cozy.   The food was super delicious and the wine spectacular.   They have an immense list of Italian wines.  I went there to celebrate a birthday and the staff (Rafael) was able to accommodate a surprise dessert with candle and everything.   There is valet parking ($27) which is perfect to avoid the hassle of finding parking in the North End.> Came here for a dinner with my family. We got the smelts, lobster pasta, steak, and ossobucco. The smelts were not my cup of tea (could have just been me). We had a rather exuberant waiter who spent the majority of our dinner at our table, which is absolutely not my cup of tea (he messed up a good amount of our orders as well). The food was very expensive and really not worth it. The steak I got was small and just okay. The best part of it was the foie gras and it was only one bite. The location however was great and the little, romantic room was very cute!We skipped out on dessert at the restaurant and went down the street to Bova's (HIGHLY recommend). Not sure if it was an off night but can't say I'll be back anytime soon with all of the amazing options in the North End.> Very good, if slightly pricey experience, this evening at Mamma Maria which is located in Boston's North End but slightly off the regular beaten track of Hanover Street.I booked on Open Table and we were immediately seated when we arrived on time. A nice two-top table upstairs (I think this is a converted home) not far from the bar.Great service starting with a hearty bread that looked delicious and I skipped as it's not on my eating regime. Burrata as appetizer was a smaller portion but looking delicious and tasting better.Mamma Maria does not have a ""specials"" list because everything on the menu is prepared from that day's purchases. So I decided on the ""Bistecca alla Fiorentina"" which was a good sized steak (I opted for not the bone-in), grilled to medium rare and served with eggplant, sea beans and spring vegetables. When it arrived, it was cooked exactly right and I dug in to a delicious large cut of meat that needed nothing additional. Flavorful and firm. Yum.No dessert for me, but I did bring my dining companion over to Mike's for a canoli.[Review 10801 overall, 569 of 2019.]> Lovely, cute, cozy (even crowded) North End Italian restaurant.  Definitely recommended for folks touring in Boston and want to experience the North End Italian scene.  Book early as it fills up fast.  We had a great waiter.  The food varied from amazing (an off-menu pasta with truffles that we noticed our neighbors eating) to very good (the carpaccio) to could have been better (the veal milanese was really brown or crunchy and the meat was kind fatty -- never I ate it and it was good; just not what I'd hoped for.)  My advice:  go here, and ask the waiter what to order as it seems a bit more variable than most.","5, 5, 2, 4, 4"

Nestled in the South End in between B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop is an innovative and fun way to experience fine dining. Pre-paid reservations are made easily online and include tax + gratuity. You select the theme that you would like to experience. They offer hands on classes or cooking demonstrations where the only thing you need to lift is your fork and wine glass. Of course we chose the latter. The whole experience was interactive and delicious. We asked the chef a bunch of questions which he happily answered. Every wine pairing was fantastic and complimented the flavors of the dish! I would definitely recommend this for date night or for an intimate group dinner.> The kitchen space can seat maximum of 10 people and thus creates a intimate feel. The food is cooked in front of you - it was really cool to watch the pasta being made live. Food was great and we were given short explanations on the wine pairings throughout. Maybe it was because the food is so fresh - but one of us had a bug crawl in the food...Overall really great experience - taste is superb and as expected of a place of this caliber and pricing. Just nothing memorable that'll make me want to run back here over the many other high end places.> Foodies take note, this is the ultimate 5 star experience.  I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift and a gift to my taste buds it was!  Unlike regular cooking classes, this is more akin to having your very own gourmet chefs and sommelier hosting a very intimate dinner for a table of 10 (see pics and video).   Each night debuts a different culinary adventure and on ours, we got to partake on their wonderful Shellfish & Citrus spread. Every course was meticulously created with all the freshest, highest quality ingredients and the chefs would explain how each were prepared and share tips on how to cook it perfectly from scratch.  Some dishes like the raw oyster with the sweet mignonette sauce, scallop ceviche and crab salad were made more delicately to preserve that fresh seafood taste while others like the fried clams, shrimp romesco and tuna dishes showcased a more bolder taste with Asian and Mediterranean flavors which paired beautifully with their mild red wines.   Everything tasted divine.  And the staff?  So friendly!  It was like having a couple of really good friends hosting and cooking up a storm at their house.  We couldn't have asked for a better night out.  Absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something just a little more out of the box.  It's a bit pricey but you won't regret it!> Stir provides an intimate private dining experience for up to 9 people, set in their kitchen with bookshelves full of cookbooks and a single bathroom. The chef and wine sommelier are the only staff present throughout your meal, explaining each course and wine pairing to every detail. The location is set directly next to the Butcher Shop and across the street from B&G Oysters, completing the ultimate Barbara Lynch triad in the South End.RESERVATIONS:Look up their class schedule online and e-mail reservations@stirboston.… to reserve a class. The classes fill up so quickly that I ended up signing up for waitlist spots and got multiple openings last-minute. I would suggest looking into classes a month in advance! Before coming in, I thought it would be an interactive cooking class where we would help prepare the meal, but in reality the chef just cooks in front of you and shares techniques from a specific cookbook. They will lay out some of the prep work required, and share tips on how to cook the course. Our wine sommelier shared each wine's origin, flavor profile, and ideal food pairings. In total, we had 5 courses with 5 different wines from Michael Psilakis' ""How to Roast a Lamb: New Greek Classic Cooking."" At the end of the meal, we received this cookbook! We can now attempt to duplicate this amazing experience at home. This was the most unique dining experience to date, and my boyfriend and I agree that Stir tops Barbara Lynch's restaurants.> Wonderful experience, fantastic host, a convivial atmosphere that is more dinner party then fine dinning. The food and wine pairings were spot on. I would love to have learned more about the book and authors to connected to the meal. Great experience. Can't wait to go back!","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The pizza was good and they were not shy with the toppings. The sauce had a good flavor but was not enough.Please add more sauce !> Service was really great. But... we didn't find the pizza itself good at all. Everything kinda left a bad taste in our mouths.  Like, a lingering oily feel and taste.  You cant really go wrong w cheese or pepperoni, usually...  we thought those would be safe.  And then I decided to be adventurous by trying the potato skin & bbq chicken.  Bad idea.But at least now we know. ‍> Awesome pizza which says A lot because I'm a NY native and I am loyal to nyc pizza. James was great as my sister and I are visiting Boston and he gave us some great info about the area! Pizza was delicious and fresh and affordable.> So I ordered the vegan jerk pizza on Postmates and I am in awe, I literally called to double check it was vegan. Legit so freakin good, I'm so glad that I know about this place. The crust was amazing and the almond based sauce is soo freaking good. I have always been wary of trying jack fruit but holy moly that's yummy, and had a good kick! Plus there is mango on top which I thought was an interesting choice but I'm obsessed!

I ordered a half sized appetizer - stuffed eggplant and a half order of the lobster ravioli. I honestly have no idea how I would have finished a full size of these dishes. I saw other people's pasta dishes and I swear they got served a bucket of pasta. If I lived in Boston I'd order the full sized dishes and then feed myself for at least two more meals. If you're visiting you may just want to ask for half size. I'd like to add that the service was great too. I was in a huge rush (realllllllly pushing the limit on getting to the airport on time) and they accommodated me accordingly. I'd definitely come back.> Finally tried the famous Rino's after hearing about it for years and listening to my friend describe the massive portions.On his suggestion, we ordered a dish that he couldn't remember the name of and I can't remember the name of. It was basically a fettucine dish with cream sauce, chicken, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes (which my friend raved about), and mushrooms. True to his proclamation, the plate was huge and it was good that we split it because we still had plenty to take home with us. The garden salad and bread were so so. Admittedly, I would have expected better for the bread but you don't come here (or wait) for the bread. By the way, we were told it would probably be a ten minute wait on Friday night around 8 pm so we stopped by Kelly's pub for a drink. While we were eating, we saw others waiting for probably an hour. That said, apparently, you can make a reservation ahead of time. We also shared an appetizer beforehand. I think it was the caprese which we probably should have finished before leaving. The tiramisu dessert was wonderful. As my friend described it, it was light, which is perfect for a heavy, rich dinner. We easily finished that and being a dessert lover, I wish it was as large as dinner.> Great Authentic Italian restaurant.  So worth the wait. Called ahead and waited for them to call us to let us know table was available. Hung out at Kellys Square Pub (Fantastic Pub) until our time. Every thing we ordered in our party of 9 was dynamite. The Lobster Ravioli that we were  told was out of this world was just that... the Frutti De Mare in white sauce and red sauce....knocked outta the park. Al The apps... we had Calamari, Stuffed Eggplant, Mozerrella balls/sticks all made to perfection. All the homemade pasta insanely great....gnocchi, pappardelle, penne....all was phenomenal.  You want great Italian food without having to go to the North End....this is your stop. Service was out of this world also. And on top of all this the price was right. With what they are kicking out of that kitchen you would expect to pay those insane North End prices but not here. This is top notch and we cant wait to come back. A++++#BuddhaReview> This place is soooooo good!! Italian food just like in the North End. The lobster ravioli is the best we've had in Boston (and we have had a lot of different places' lobster ravioli!). Generally a line to get in so plan accordingly...or get take out! YUM!!!!> Another FIVE STARS! Had the same...calamari app, shrimp scampi and gnocchi with broccoli rabi and shrimp. Soooooo good.","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

I have never once had any problems with this place (I can't say the same for The Capital Grille in Chestnut Hill which always over cooked my steaks). Anyways, I once deviated from my normal order and got the wagyu which was cooked and tasted beautifully. I 100% recommend getting the creamed corn, lobster macaroni & cheese or any of their potatoes as a side dish. For red wine, I recommend pairing your steak with the 2017 Orin Swift Machete. Otherwise, they have an extensive wine collection, so you will always find something great to pair with your meal. Their cheesecake dessert is also very tasty. The atmosphere here is perfect for a steakhouse with fantastic panoramic views. All of the seating is comfortable, both at the bar and dinner tables. The servers are very knowledge and attentive. This location's manager is also very kind and accommodating. I used to see him often at the Capital Grille. He made his transition over to Del Frisco's as a manager just as I did as a diner.> Myself and some co workers went to the seaport Del Frisco's for a retirement party in early February. We booked a private room for the 15 or so of us, which was a $2000.09 mOne of us was looking at the wine list and asked if there was a solemner working who could help to order. The woman sold him on a ""magnum"" which would be about 2 glasses per guest. No mention was made of the price point or what we were looking to spend on a glass of wine with dinner. When they began pouring he asked and found that the bottle was $2750.00. I feel as though this was underhanded, unethical and the last thing I would expect from a first-class establishment (which is what Del Frisco's portrays itself to be). Further, 2 of my friends had to send their steaks back due to being over-cooked. Needless to say I will not be back nor will I recommend the restaurant ti anyone looking for a steakhouse when in Boston. Spoke with Emily who told me someone from the actual restaurant would be contacting me. Has not happened...Still waiting to hear from restaurant. Lol Good stuff> Valentines Day FAIL!  For Valentines Day you would expect a romantic quiet ambiance. Here you get a head thumping club noise level experience. We asked for the music to be turned down several times but nothing happened. They put make shift tables up and had the chairs situated so when you went to sit down you smashed your knee into the huge table leg.  I still have a bruise on my knee a week later! The staff was nice. The drinks were good, but took forever to arrive. The filet medallions were good but it was a small portion.I think the ""age steaks"" are false marketing.  As they didn't have the flavor or texture you get from a dry aged steak. Also, they make you cut into the middle of the steak to check it's cooked right when it first arrives.  Shouldn't a steak house have better confidence in there cooking?  I also don't like starting my steak in the middle. The potatoes were way over seasoned with pepper. The Brussels sprouts were yummy. Since the dry aged steak seemed to have been misrepresented, and the ambiance was terrible, I would say the food was way over priced> I'd love to give 5 stars and if this review were solely on the food, it would be 5 stars.I've been in several times and spent $1000. + on meals. Food always good!Here's the bad: I've always had a reservation and I've always been offered very poor table locations. One of the reasons the place is great is the views.Once again on the day after Valentines Day (a Saturday) we arrived at our reserved time and were escorted to a table in a room that is a function room converted to regular table space for the expected crowd. We went into the room of 25 or so tables. Nobody else in there and I said this is unacceptable. I'd like a table on the main floor which had many many open tables. The hostess stated that our room would fill up very quickly and not to worry. I didn't care about the occupancy of the room, i wanted views and ambience the main dining room offered and had a ton of tables in. She stated that all of the tables were slotted and mapped out in advance and no changes could be made. Total BS. Our waiter arrived and apologized and also stated he didn't like working the room either but we'd have to stay. Service was good and we moved on and he was a very good waiter. I did tell him and several others that every time I come in I get a lousy table, spend a lot of money and don't think I'll return. Again, apologies abound and  during our meal, only 3 more tables filled the room of around 25 total tables. When we finished our meal and began our exit through the place, there were still many tables on the main floor open. I would think a manager would have paid my table a visit and apologized, offered another table, anything but couldn't be bothered.During the meal, the lights were lowered in this room and the lights simply flickered constantly. Staff couldn't fix it and apologized. A Fairly high end steak house should be better than this! They weren't and doubt I'll return.A shame because the food and service are quite good but spending a couple hundred dollars on a meal for 2 should include a table and location worth the expense.Management wasn't busy and really could've shown up. They didn't and that's unprofessional in this and any other business.> Top notch dining experience.View of the Boston Harbour, fresh air, fresh seafood,awesome service and great ambiance Didn't dine on one of their much ballyhooedSteaks, opted instead for Shellfish Plateau It's actually designed for 2 people but themanager said they could build it for just oneperson, fantastic!!! Not everyone goes to awell known Steakhouse to order seafood.The Plateau has King Crab legs, LobsterTail, Crab Claws and shrimp. I added Raw Oysters to the Plateau and had a side of Asparagus Spears. All of it was fresh and delicious! Washed it down with beer namedVIP and also some Lagunitas IPA. Enjoyedour waitress Caroline. She was attentive,knowledgeable and fun","5, 1, 1, 1, 3"

While I enjoyed the food at the table better (can't beat a piping hot plate), it was delicious on both occasions. Just a great dining experience with some fresh pasta and a great cocktail menu. The bolognese and cacie e pepe that I had most recently for takeout came out great. I'm going back for dinner as soon as full service reopens.> Several weeks into the lockdown, I wanted something special, a really nice dinner date for myself and my husband, and turned to Fox & the Knife delivery- it was a fantastic idea! We had a wonderful date night, and all the food arrived perfectly and tasted amazing. The focaccia was absolutely out of this world: so moist and flavorful (not to mention how amazing it smelled) and with a delicious cheese! Honestly I would have ordered two of these. The brussels and burrata appetizers were also so good. For entrees, the pork milanesa came with an incredible sauce and salad, and the combination was way better than I expected. The pasta with boar Bolognese was quite light on the sauce, but still very tasty. Overall, such an delightful evening, I'm definitely coming back in person!> I have very mixed feelings about Fox And The Knife...We made a reservation about a month in advance, and the only time we could get for a table of four was 9:15. Not a big deal as it was a Saturday night, and we had hoped that a later reservation meant it would be less crowded. I was totally wrong. We got there 9:15 on the dot and the place couldn't have been more packed, it was elbow to elbow in the bar area. We didn't get seated until around 9:40 (I was not too happy that they didn't check in on us at all/provide updates), and were placed in a small high top that was very tight for 4 people. The hostess and waitress were very nice, said they would send us out some goodies for the wait, etc. Now the food was very very good, every bit as good as I keep hearing/reading. We ordered the focaccia & brussel sprouts, the luna & taglatelle (from pasta section), and the pork milanese & scallops (from the secondi section), to share. Everything was delicious particularly the luna & the pork milanese, both so light yet intensely flavored (it must be magic). Curiously I didn't think the focaccia was anything super special, given that's the one thing everyone raves about. Ours arrived kind of cold maybe that's why? Oh yes, we also had a salad, which was the ""goodies"" they said they would send.... One funny thing is everything we ordered pretty much came in 3 pieces. We weren't really bothered but it would have been nice if our waitress had mentioned it and asked if we wanted to add an extra piece or something. It made sharing a little hard. Anyway, we also ordered pretty much all of the desserts on the menu and some wine, and they were quite yummy as well. As you can see, I have no issues with the food or drinks, loved everything we had and would absolutely go back. I just really don't love the elbow to elbow trying to squeeze yourself in and make space for the waitstaff to maneuver kind of environment. It's awesome that they are doing well, and some things (like guests lingering) are not really within their control. But maybe better planning/spacing out reservations further, or limiting the amount of people that can be at the bar, would help. I want to go back, but will wait until the hype dies down a bit.> According to eater.com labels this spot one of America's best new restaurants of 2019, but my trip there didn't blow me away. Sure, the food was good, and the atmosphere was bustling, but there wasn't any singular dish that blew me away, and there were a few that were on the disappointing side. By no means was it a bad meal, but I'm not dying to go back either. If this was one of best new restaurants of 2019, it was a pretty mediocre year. The dishes that were hyped up to us didn't live up to expectations. Disappointing, but not terrible.> DINNER REVIEWWOW! Just WOW! I had heard good things about Fox & The Knife but I've also heard good things about other new restaurants and I've been disappointed. Not here! This was one of the best meals I've had in Boston and I can't wait to come back.WAIT: We went right when it opened and beware that the bar before the dining room does so we had to wait about 15 minutes. No big deal and I imagine that many of you will not be going right when it opens so check with others about prime time wait. Also something to consider: it's kind of isolated so if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait, not the best area to come for restaurantsFOOD: This is what we came for...when I took a look at the menu, it was short, especially for an Italian restaurant, but I LOVE short menus (I always do). It means they specialize and focus on making a few good things really good. That said, I think I could have ordered every thing on the menu and been very happy...each element of each dish was clearly intentional and there for a reason.It was only two of us so we didn't order too much but here is what we got:Focaccia Taleggio - ""$12 for focaccia?!"" you're probably thinking. But this isn't just homemade buttery focaccia (which alone would be worth it!). This is a FANCY grilled cheese with amazing melted cheese in the middle. This is a must-get! Better yet, get a couple!Harissa Braised Agnello - I am not a big pasta person so I went with this. This was a beautiful, tender, fall off the bone lamb shank over some delicious carrot polenta and top with mint gremolata. My only wish: That I ordered another.Pistachio Ice Cream Sandwich - My goodness, this off-menu dessert item is a MUST GET. I mean, you have to like pistachio but even if you do a little, GET IT. It's pistachio ice cream between these thin waffle cookies and then dipped in chocolate that has hardened and is drizzled with pistachios. It all held together really well which makes me think they assembled it beforehand. I think it's better that way because it's not too messy.Run, do not walk, to Fox & The Knife!","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

Place has nice music, not too loud, very chill environment and ambiance.Boyfriend ordered the burger. He loved it. Things he had to say about this as he's eaten a LOT of burgers from all over the place: structural integrity was solid - it didn't fall apart as he was eating it, good patty and taste, didn't taste the sauce that much (supposed to be a miso mushroom sauce) but still good. He didn't even let me try a bite so i know he loved it :') fries he also liked, but the star was definitely the burger.I ordered the truffled gratin pizza - really good, but after a while, truffle can be overwhelming so keep that in mind if you have to eat it. It was still delicious though! Really good fluffy/chewy crust, crisp underside, good tasting cheese. At one point i dipped  part of the crust into my bf's garlic aioli sauce he got for his fries and that sauce was good too.  Couple things about service - waitress very nice and attentive, they gave us our own glass water bottle which we appreciate cuz we drink a lot of water and prefer self-serve, food came out quick like no more than 20 mins!! (we had spent 45 mins waiting for take out from another restaurant in the area for 2 things... That wasn't great), very solid prices compared to those in the area - i think price was on point with the quality of the food and very worth it. Overall, this is a place we'll be coming back to for future Boston trips. I'm already choosing what to eat for next time (corn & crab hushpuppies, ten spice wings, blue crab mac n cheese -- also i remembered the names of these dishes so you can tell how excited I am to have these one day) love it! Only bummer was we were so hungry we didn't take a photo of the food...> Came on my second trip for some pre-PAX dinner &  drinks with friends. We were late for our Resy, but a call-ahead assured us our table would await. Keith was very friendly and helpful. One member of the party has an intolerance to both wheat and rice -- if you know your gluten free, you know most of it uses rice flour -- and to our astonishment we learned that all the GF stuff was rice-free. The GF pizza was the best she ever had, and the rest of the party also enjoyed the crab hush puppies, the shrimp tempora, the aristocrat pizza (very sweet, arugula offsets nicely), and a meat pizza.This will be a regular stop for us every time we are in Boston!> Fun place to watch sports and enjoy a beer! Recommend if you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite and enjoy a good beer. Bartenders are pretty busy most the time, so it may take a second or two to grab their attention. Overall everyone is really low key and relaxed. Good atmosphere> We were back in town for a long weekend; had late checkout at the hotel and needed brunch! City Tap House fit the bill. Cool space - and it was really busy about 11:00 or so on a Saturday morning. The breakfast quesadilla did not disappoint! AwesomeFlavors of eggs, cheese, hash browns, onion, bacon all baked into one delicious tortilla. Definitely recommend this spot! Will come back the next time we are.> Love the outside patio (especially on a weirdly warm January day). It was pretty big and just separated enough from the sidewalk people with the little fence/greenery! Massive beer selection. I didn't eat anything but definitely drank my fill! Wicked nice bartenders and pretty fair/normal prices. The menu looked promising so maybe next time!!","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

I caught up with a friend here over a nice enough meal and split a great bottle of wine while listening to a jazz band kill it on stage. Can't ask for much more than that. If possible, ask for a table close to the show so that you can make the most of your visit to the Beehive. It wasn't a cheap night out, but well worth it if you consider that you're paying for dinner and a show. The space itself seemed well thought out from our vantage point near the stage.> Came here yesterday for a brunch with my guys.The service was good, everyone was very nice, attentive, and seemed like they wanted you to have a good time.The waiter was a bit forgetful and even though wee had a big group, wasn't using his notepad to take orders, which would have been helpful because he forgot a few things.For the food, it was ok - i had the short rib benedict and the skirt steak with eggs. The portions were decent but the flavor was mediocre in my opinion.The drinks are really good!!'The ambiance was nice and I appreciated the live Jazz.Probably a place to come for Jazz & drinks, but not for the food, honestly. Also really crowded so book a reservation!> Went to The Beehive for Saturday brunch and was glad that I did! Also, definitely make a reservation if you can. There was live jazz which was awesome and the dining rooms downstairs have a cool rustic meets slightly swanky vibe that reminds me of New Orleans. Definitely sit downstairs instead of the mezzanine up too. Service was pretty good and food came out in a timely manner.The Eggs Shakshuka was tasty but one of the poached eggs was overcooked so the yoke wasn't runny at all but the other egg was perfect. I added the merguez spiced lamb to it and it was flavorful and tender. Overall I would definitely order it again though it wasn't quite as filling as I'd hoped so you might want to add a side of something if you like a bigger brunch.The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was very flavorful. The salmon was delicious, the poached eggs were perfect, and the English muffins were really good. The plate comes with greens as a side, I'd probably get an order of frites with the meal next time. I'd say one of the Benedicts are what I'd order next time I go!The vibe is the true winner of this place! They have live jazz for weekend brunch and in the evenings on Fridays and the weekend I believe. There seems to be a shortage of nice jazz club/restaurants around Boston so I'm happy to have found this one! (Let me know if you know other good ones!)> Went here today with friends and have mixed feelings about this place. Here's the rundown,THE GOOD-huge restaurant with multiple rooms-the decor is outstanding, very unique and hip-the live band, they sounded really good-unique menu, and there's a hidden American Breakfast option with scrambled eggs, and baconTHE BAD-hostesses are too cool to be nice. Even with a reservation they hardly informed me of anything. They treated me with such disrespect. -poor service from kitchen staff, the breakfast I ordered was missing the cheddar cheese when the kitchen staff member brought it to the table. He said he would look into it, but I never heard back from him. -poor service from server, he was spilling coffee onto our table and not providing any apology, not cleaning it up, or providing extra napkins without asking, it was shocking.-prices here are pretty high, 3 coffees and 3 breakfast plates came to $70, before tip. It's too bad the service is bad from all the staff we encountered, as it's such a nice place inside.> Cute place for some Sunday brunch. The atmosphere is casual and fun with live music. I enjoyed a Bloody Mary to complement my eggs Benedict. They were cooked perfectly and not over the top with too much hollandaise sauce. Our waiter was kind and very attentive,  and the service - great! Next time you are in Boston, go to the South End and have a good meal!","5, 3, 4, 2, 5"

Our one friend wasn't a fan of lobster or oysters so he opted for his mother country's staple food, fish and chips, or as we refer to them lovingly as fries. The lobster rolls were rich in butter and lovely with each bite. Could have eaten a second one but one was enough. My friend enjoyed his fish and chips. Can you really mess up fish and chips? We also had some starter dishes and they were also good too.> Love me some Legal but this location was tremendously disappointing experience for lunch on a weekend. Ambience/atmosphere was fun. Great exterior and nice interior. They have a lovely Koi pond. The interior space has some awkward seatings arrangements but not the worst. Service was challenging. We had an eager waitress but she looked stressed, disappeared for long periods of time, was complaining about the cooking staff being backed up to us in person and then audibly stating everyone was screwing things up today. When we asked about why other tables got their food (and similar dishes!) much quicker while our party had to wait she looked panicked. One manager seemed to ask her the same and if she delivered to the wrong table. We respectfully expressed our hunger and frustrations thrice with her, and then with the manager who stopped by who apologized. Unfortunately no expedited replacement of our food, and the bill was without any reparations or compensation. It wasn't even a busy day! Very disappointing. The food was generally good though some dishes obviously had been sitting out a long time and not at the ideal temperature. The seafood tower was flavorful but a smaller portion that I was expecting and the menu conveyed, especially compared to other Legal experiences. The kid menu items were quite bland -- massive plates of pasta and fries and very little of the veg or fruit advertised. The fisherman's chowder main course was amazingly rich and filling despite the quaint appearance. Price was as you'd expect for Legal and decent quality for higher prices than some competitors. The tower should have been cheaper for the selection offered. Overall wouldn't visit this Legal location again and definitely recommend avoiding if you're bringing your kids due to wait times and awkward seating arrangements.> Came here to try the lobster roll and boy was it the best in Boston. My wife and I tried 5 different places from casual to fine dining and Legal Sea Foods topped our list for hot buttery lobster rolls.The red sangria was sweet and good and the Sam Adams Lager was nice and cold. The crab cake was moist and tasty as well as the citrusy flavored salad. My only wish would be that the fries were more crisp when plated with the lobster roll, but that was minor compared to the star lobster roll. Definitely worth a taste... Of the wicked good lahbsta> I used to come here as a college student, but back then I could only afford it on special occasions because it broke my bank.Now that I'm older and can afford it I can't say it has the same special appeal it used to have.  The clam chowder is still one of the best in town. If you like the commercial variety that is starchy and uses sea clams.  Good ""clammy-flavor"".  But Down East in Maine it's more sour-milk based, and they use little necks or small steamers.For old time's sake I ordered the Baked Scrod.  It's kind of like going into an Italian place and ordering spaghetti and meatballs.  If you can't get the basics done right, then I'm not coming back.  So the Baked Scrod just didn't seem fresh.  I believe the white fish of the day was cod.  Just mediocre, and the breading could have been more buttery and crunchy.  Sorry Legal Sea Foods, your stock went way down in my book.  I'd only come back for another bowl of the chowdah.> Stopped by for dinner after the aquarium and had a wonderful dinner before heading up north. I got 6 oysters and a lobster roll for lunch. The lobster roll said market price which is quite a nerve wracking thing to see on the menu. Ended up being $30 or so for the roll. The lobster was cooked in butter and served on a warm roll. It was definitely delicious but not the best lobster roll I've had, especially at that price. The oysters were delicious and served with a nice array of sauces. We also got the crab dip to split and it was served with some weird rice chip, which was odd but the dip was very good. Definitely enjoyed everything but certainly could have been better.","4, 2, 5, 5, 3"

I loved that they had options for burnt ends which is my favorite! I got a combo plate of pork belly burnt ends and brisket. Both were sooooo tender and not dry at all! They have barbecue sauces at the tables which were fun to try! They have one sweet spicy one that hit the spot! Service was great! They were super attentive and hospitable. Went on a weeknight and was still busy even for a table for 2! I recommend making a reservation ahead of time> This was a new-to-me spot and it was fabulous! We came for lunch on Valentine's Day instead of Shake Shack and I'm glad we did!Of all the things we had, you NEED the Mac & Cheese bites. They were the highlight and the ranch you dip them in is insane.We each got the pit crew platter with two meats and two sides. The pork belly was good (not the best I've ever had but solid) as was the pulled pork. The brussel sprouts were  as were the mashed potatoes. We also enjoyed a couple cocktails. The classic old fashioned was a winner and perfect to pair with the BBQ.> I've been here twice, although I couldn't remember the first time when I returned last Friday night until I was about halfway through. In both instances, I do recall the place being packed and really loud. When my friend and I walked in, we walked past an empty table and headed to the bar to look for adjacent seating. As I noted earlier, it was packed and it wasn't clear anyone would be leaving soon so we stepped out and decided to try our luck at other places. We returned and were seated at the empty table we first saw when we realized the other possibilities were not. Unfortunately, we were seated near a large group, and one member had a particularly loud and annoying laugh.We decided to split the BBQ pulled chicken plate on the suggestion of the server after she heard we were going to order the pulled chicken sandwich and three sides. The plate, as its name suggested, did not come with bread, but came with two sides. We ended up trying the brussels sprouts, bacon collards, and scallion mashed potatoes. I don't think either of us liked the collards. Luckily, I wasn't hungry or maybe it was perfect. My friend said he was hungry but we ended up splitting the order so I don't think the portions are very big. He ordered a beer and the table next to us ordered several flights of whiskey. Additionally, the restaurant serves cocktails and wine. The restroom was clean although on the women's side they only had two stalls so it can be a bit of a wait on a busy night.> As far as I know I have now visted the 3 locations around Boston. This is how much I love this place. The food is always amazing and the staff is incredible. The cornbread here is 2nd best to Kendall Sq. Tho they had such a beautiful amount of butter on there.Now comes the part I don't like. Despite making a reservation and showing on time we were placed in the worst seating area possible. It was cramped and crowded. Noisy, terrible. I just asked if I could sit at the bar and so we did that.OH! and for as long as I've been drinking I have never had a sangria so good.While there we were greeted by Matthew who is incredible and fun. But he wasn't the only one and that was confusing. We had two ppl checking on us and serving us we weren't sure who to put what order too or if this person is coming in lieu of the other. If we had to reput in our order.The food was worth every star I could give but the experience was a bumby one.> Ok so I've actually been here twice without reviewing; this review will be based on my first visit. I came in as a party of 2 on a dead weeknight, was seated immediately. Our server seemed miserable but it became quickly clear it was due to an extremely needy and irritating party of 10 that he also had. I would've been miserable if I had them too. It didn't affect the quality of his service though. Everything was smooth and came out quickly. The lemon-limeade and peach sweet tea were both great. I'm a sides gal, so I got Mac and cheese, collards, and Brussels sprouts. My counterpart got smoked turkey, pit beans, burnt ends, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were the worst item, but they were still fine. The STAR of the show was not the meat, but the Brussels sprouts!!! I don't know who gave them permission to have such delicious sprouts (like what a random thing to steal the show) but they were INCREDIBLE. Everything else was super good too! Reasonable prices for sure. We got dessert, the banana pudding was incredibly lackluster, it didn't taste like bananas at all. Only thing I would not recommend. As I mentioned, I have already been back so I would clearly recommend coming here!","4, 5, 3, 3, 5"

There was a short line (the host said about 15 minutes), but the table was ready much faster. You could actually join the waitlist on Yelp, but the whole party needs to be there to get seated. We sat close to the kitchen. The restaurant has a cozy ambience with a lot of wood decoration (including the ceiling) and good service. We got two pizzas (pistachio and pesto, carmine). Both were delicious. The dough has this great chewy wheaty taste. Our favorite was the pistachio and pesto pizza. The pesto sauce is not heavy, and just the right amount of pistachio to enhance the crunchiness and flavor. The waitress offered us a small bottle of balsamic vinegar sauce (the condensed version you sometimes would see on pizza). I highly recommend asking for it/adding it to any pizza with white sauce. Overall it was a satisfying dining experience. If you're around north end and crave high quality Italian style pizza, this is the spot!> Spent a recent Saturday eating my way through Boston recently.  By the time my wife and I reached the North End we were not super hungry but looking for a small meal to share.  A quick search of Yelp led us here.  The two of us shared a warm ricotta appetizer that was mild but very creamy and satisfying.  We also split a small pizza ""Parma due"" which was topped with Gorgonzola, figs, prosciutto and arugula.  Despite the quality toppings, I must admit the crust was a highlight.... especially the outer crust which was crunchy on the outside yet almost fluffy on the inside. I could have used a bit more crispness in the center but overall this was a very strong offering. Definitely will be back.> We got lucky by getting a table for two here on Valentine's Day! We sat in the window at a high top that was very comfortable since we could lean against the wall. Service was good, very nice. We ordered the garlic toast which came with dipping sauce which was steaming hot! We also ordered the margarita pizza which was fantastic. Cooked in a brick oven grill and with fresh basil, sauce, and fresh cheese. Yum. Appreciated that they had parmesan cheese and pepper sprinkle on the table. Perfectly satisfying!> Good place in North End for an affordable personal size brick oven pizza. While the place isn't big, it doesn't get busy with tourists so there were plenty of open tables during lunch. I had a Margherita pizza to which I added prosciutto. I enjoyed both the pizza and the service at Locale. This is a nice option for a pizza if you want something nicer than a pizza by the slice shop but don't want to go to any of the fancy and/or tourist packed restaurants in the North End.> Located in Boston's Little Italy, this is a simple pizza place that really brings the full Italian essence to its pizza. I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my ""Parma Due"" pizza (prosciutto, arugula, figs and gorgonzola). It was the perfect combination that brought me back to my last vacation to Italy. I ended up finishing (to my personal horror and shame) the entire pizza all by myself, but it was worth every last bite. Delectable.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

The food taste was slightly above average, but still lower than my expectation. However, the skewers were still very nice and worth trying. As a newly opened Chinese BBQ place, I believe they can do better and hope they don't drop their quality.> I was pretty eager to try this place because Boston doesn't really have an authentic Chinese BBQ skewers place. After trying this place, it definitely beats my expectations of skewers quality and flavor. From a service perspective, there is room for improvement. In terms of skewers, my friend and I ordered beef, lamb, chicken, Mongolian special lamb, octopus, and grilled scallops. Everything is very good and the spice they put on really adds to the taste. Highly recommend the octopus and Mongolian lamb. The New Orleans chicken also has a special smoky bbq taste. To wrap up, we ordered a spicy hot noodle soup to finish out the night.What leaves much to be desired is the service. I ordered a draft beer that is half foam, service was slow, but understandable given they just revamped this place and started fresh. They also charged me extra accidentally. From a pricing stand point, we spend about 40 dollars each  which is slightly on the expensive side but hard to argue with where the location is. Overall, definitely worth a try if you are looking for some authentic chinesE skewers> This place was hyped up for its NYC locations before and I'm excited that this authentic and popular Chinese BBQ restaurant eventually found its way in Boston! Haggis Soup in Pot (羊杂汤）- highly recommend! Haggis is a savoury mix of lamb/sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs). Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavor! It's rarely seen here in US, let alone cook it as well as it here! It's a whole new level of northern Chinese food!Seafood Rice Noodle Soup was great, too! Full of flavors and beautiful in color! Very fulfilling with one bowl!All the skewers are great!I came here with my friends on its second soft opening day. The wait was bad :/ we were told to wait 20-30 min but turned out over 1 hour, which was not pleasant. Waiters are very nice and friendly but not quite attentive. They kept apologizing for inefficient operation of the restaurant but I'd rather receiving fast service than apologies. I believe it will get better with a little effort though! Will come back!> Overpriced... the seafood boil for 2 is not spicy... not mala flavor just herbs. The seafood is not fresh at all... the grilled scallops and oyster is $5.99 each... kind of over grilled for the oyster and the scallop was small since they sliced it. The seafood rice noodle pot was okay but nothing special. Service is okay and kind of busy during lunch on Friday even the business is weak due to coronavirus but it is better than I thought. But I wouldn't come back again. The food doesn't worth the price.> This place is average. My friend suggested we check out this place, and we were excited to try this place out. We ordered the enoki mushroom pot and combo of small beef, lamb, and pork...and I could say they were SMALL.  We realized that we should have just ordered individually skewers, which we tried the Mongolian beef that had 4 pieces on one skewer.  I would recommend the Mongolian beef skewer. The service was slow, and the owner seemed to be the only one that would check in on us. Before we got our last skewer, one of the waiters gave us our bill. We might come back to try more skewers and hope the service would be better.","4, 4, 4, 1, 3"

I don't really eat a lot of cajun places here in MA, but I would come back. I don't really think it would be my go-to, but for the Allston-Brighton area, I'd say I would probably steer myself towards Holly Crab than anywhere else.So, I only got the Holly Crab flavor. My boyfriend and I got two bags. One of Spicy and another of Medium. First bite, I wasn't convinced that I liked this place as much as Cap't Loui (I go to the one in Stoneham), but the more I ate it, the more the flavor got better. The only thing is, I don't think there was much of a difference between the Spicy and the Medium.Fresh crawfish obviously wasn't in season since it was winter time but it was still good and meaty. Snow crab legs were also full of meat and could really soak up the Holly Crab flavor. Snow crab is also my boyfriend's favorite. My boyfriend liked the shrimp (I can't really say much since I'm not too much of a shrimp eater). It's a solid place to go to, but I can't really say I'm in love with it? But I'm also not saying I hate it.Service was ok when wait staff would come around, but they don't really come around much. It's kind of just a hi and bye.> Been a loyal customer for 3 years and have seen it go down hill ever since the renovation. Sauce is no longer chunky and full of flavor, now it's watered down. Shrimp used to be fresh but definitely taste frozen now. We ordered fried oysters and chicken wings tonight and were blown away(in a negative way). Oysters were definitely frozen and were EXTREMELY fishy. When we ordered the chicken wings they told us it would be 25 minutes. After looking at the restaurant we realized all the tables already had their entree's so where's he wait time from? Holly Crab Sauce was lacking significant flavor. Not sure what changed from before the renovation but flavor and quality have continued to go downhill ever since.Lastly, it's November 10th and your server said that Sam Adams Summer was the Sam Seasonal option haha. We've already past Summer, October Fest, and are now onto Winter. Does that mean the Winter will be available in May 2020?> The recent visit disappointed me. I always visited this place for its seafood, but the last order from them was not fresh at all. Disgusted taste with powdery meat showed the shrimps were not properly stored or just not fresh.Then the mussels were extremely fishy and contains lots of sands(some hard crystal stuff). The sauce only had a spicy taste, then nothing. I am upset. I will look for a new place which cook seafood with the same style.> If you're from California and craving some ""boiling crab""-like seafood, this is the place for you! I would definitely go here for a pound of shrimp with all the flavors + medium-spice level, a bowl of rice, and corn on the cob. The flavoring is not as good as Boiling Crab, but it comes close -- enjoy!> I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food. The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good. As for some additional foods:- Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin.- Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice. Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty.","4, 2, 2, 4, 4"

Had I known I would have told them well, well, well done. They didn't even ask how I wanted my burger. I think they should ask and not just serve the raw hamburgers to everyone.

Some of the items on the menu have been hit or miss for me. The employees there are super friendly but they have tendency to get my order wrong whenever I order through their mobile app which is disappointing. Luckily I work around the corner so I can just come in if there is a mistake but definitely should improve on getting orders correct. I have never sat down to eat here because it's always busy during the times I have come but if you like burgers then wahlburgers has a good selection of good burgers. They are pretty expensive so I wouldn't come here all the time. Burger will cost you anywhere from 8-$13. They have a good selection of salads if you are vegetarian and they just recently introduced the ""Impossible Burger"" to their menu that is worth trying out.> Don't waste your money! Just Spent $50 on lunch- curbside pick up , the staff forgot to put any plastic forks or spoons , essential for Mac n cheese.  Their phone rang out and I had to walk back in where the staff stood about and I requested plastic forks and napkins- burgers were disgusting and fries were not much better.

The clam chowder was very good. I have had better lobster rolls...although big portion, flavorless...no drawn butter nor mayonnaise ... I should have gotten a bowl (not a cup) of chowder and a half dozen oysters..My wife had the scallops and daughter got the fish a chips. Both excellent. Corn bread served instead of bread.A little pricey, but you are paying for the ambiance. If this is you first trip to Boston and the Freedom Trail, this should be on your bucket list> Advertised as the oldest restaurant in America. My travel group and I tried this place. It certainly was old. Warning this place is not ADA compliant. No ramp, tons of staid and steps and the bathroom stalls at least for the ladies were so tiny. I'm a small girl and both of my shoulders nearly touched either side of the stall walls. You walk in and there is an actual oyster bar to the left. There was more seating upstairs. And then through about her room and then through yet another room. Wonder how many hidden hide away rooms there were. This place is also famous because it was Kennedy's favorite spot. They even have a booth on the second floor dedicated to him as the ""Kennedy Booth"". This apparently was his table he always sat at. Ordered oysters. Which were great!  The mixed drink was not so great. My main was a stuffed lobster. It took an eon to arrive and also not so great. It was just full of breading with not so much lobster. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a quality dining experience. However if you're doing the self guided freedom trail tour this stop is on the way. I'd recommend to make a quick stop at the oyster bar and have a few oysters and walk upstairs to check out the Kennedy booth.> America's oldest restaurant seems to live off it's reputation rather than its quality. While the overall experience was cool (the Kennedy's sat over there!), I can't recommend the food. It was overly buttered and salted for my taste, and didn't provide much in the way of flavour. Before you decide to go, you should realize that you're really going to a museum that happens to serve food. If visiting places with history is up your alley, head to the Oyster House, if not, stay away. The one dish of note were the raw clams that they had on offer. I've never had raw clams before, and I can't say that I'll be having them again. While I didn't hate it, I'm not sure that I'll be a future fan of ""like raw chicken from the sea"", as one of my friends described it. Not the best description, but very apt. While I didn't mind it, I'm not sure why people would really enjoy it> The first time I ate here, I dined at the half moon oyster bar downstairs and spent $40 on a plate of so-so oysters. This time, I returned and we decided to eat upstairs in the restaurant part. Know that there are 3 rooms set throughout the restaurant ... bottom floor is bright, upper portion is the old part and the most historic/dark and upper side room is brighter with windows but not at all historic.This is mainly a tourist restaurant these days which serves average to below average seafood churned out to the masses. My suggestion is to ask at check-in if you can be seated in the oldest dining room, if you want the whole historic experience though it does feel a bit dark and dingy. Ask for The Kennedy booth, if it's available which is the big booth near the bar in the back. It is supposedly where JFK sat who was a regular ... although when I was a kid, I do remember a booth downstairs to the left of the oyster bar as having a plaque/photo and dedication, so who knows. Often restaurants designate the worst tables as 'histpric' so people don't complain about them and the 'Kennedy booth' is right next to a busy service bar.The food here ... the clam chowder we got was loaded with flour and/or corn starch which is used to thicken it. It was a thick paste and had little to no clams or flavor. At $7 PER CUP!!! obviously this is a signature dish which they know they can charge a lot for but it was a piss poor effort and I wouldn't order again. It was also served barely warm. If charging $7 for a small cup of soup it better be good ... and this wasn't.The fish of the day was a Sole, which I ordered broiled. It came as a thick piece of fish ... it looked nothing like sole. I believe they brought me haddock by mistake. No way was this sole. It was covered in a thick coating of burned tasting breadcrumbs and paprika. It was rubbery and had a strange and offputting taste ... hard to put my finger on but maybe it was the loads of paprika? I'd never order this again.Other had fried scallops and clams, which were fine ... maybe a slight taste of old oil which needed to be changed ... but it's hard to mess up fried seafood. The lobster roll was also fine ... maybe a little over dressed and the portion size was smaller than expected for the price. Mostly smaller pieces of claw meet with little tail. For the price, there are better lobster rolls in town. All meals come with cornbread which tastes made from a mix but is sort of nice. The Boston Baked Beans are $6.50 on their own as a side ... not worth it but your waitress may substitute them for french fries as your side for free if you ask. The cole slaw is nasty.I give 4 stars for the atmosphere and because it is such a 'Bostonian' experience that usually people from out of town will be happy if you bring them here purely from a historic atmosphere experience that they'll overlook the mediocre food at high prices. My favorite seafood restaurant in the city is the Atlantic Fish Company near Newbury Street and The Boston Common. If you are looking for good seafood in a classy atmosphere, you'd do better here. If you are looking for a historic experience in a famous restaurant and don't mind average food, you'll be fine at The Union Oyster House.> Had such an epic meal at Union Oyster House on Saturday night with a bunch of friends from all over the place. Sure, this place can be a bit touristy but who cares, it's an institution. The best part of the evening was our server (Stephanie I believe) who had the best Boston accent I'd ever heard. She worked hard and was a true pleasure to have that evening. I ordered the little neck clams and we shared some oysters which were all fabulous. East coast clams are second to none and so damn delicious. I also had a little cup of chowder alongside the cornbread and it was way better than I expected. For my main I had the boiled lobster (medium) because the 1.25/1.5 pound lobsters taste the best to me. Boo ya. Make sure to at least hit the semi circled oyster bar in the front of the restaurant while visiting Boston, it's a great experience.","4, 2, 3, 3, 3"
Red's Best Seafood at the Boston Public Market,Boston,4.5,2,No,Null,No,redsbest.com,"Seafood, Seafood Markets",8:00 am - 8:00 pm,8:00 am - 8:00 pm,8:00 am - 8:00 pm,8:00 am - 8:00 pm,8:00 am - 8:00 pm,8:00 am - 8:00 pm,10:00 am - 8:00 pm,Null,Null,"This is the best seafood spot in Boston! Look no further!  I've tried oyster po boys here, lobster rolls, clam chowder, lobster bisque, and fresh raw oysters. Their best item is the oyster po boy. From the flavorful breading on the oysters to the sauce, and the perfectly buttery bun, everything about it was perfect! Their lobster bisque was my second favorite thing there. It is a must try. I went to Quincy Market after the first time coming here, and Red's Best Seafood is still 100% better than anything that I got there.The second time that we went (we had to come here for our last meal in Boston because the first one was so phenomenal), we got super lucky and got $1 oysters. The oysters were $2.25 per piece the first time we went. Their lobster rolls are the most perfectly executed that I had in Boston. The bun was perfectly buttery. The lobster roll had tiny pieces of celery and parsley on it. Every bite had a lot of lobster inside.There was never a line here when we went. There are seats around the stand. You order on one side of the store and pick up your food at the other end. There are boards saying where each their items are from. There's even a little map by the waiting area to show you the process of how they get their fresh seafood.There is a ton of stuff we didn't get a chance to try here yet, but I definitely recommend trying Red's Best if you're in Boston!> I had one free (freezing) day in Boston, and walked into the Boston Public Market for some warmth. The selection of foods/treats is impressive, but I decided that while in Boston, I had to go for some seafood. Red's Best Seafood is situated in the back of the market, with an extensive display of fresh, locally sourced seafood. I opted for a cup (5$) of clam chowder and the fish sandwich. Clam chowder: pretty decent, as far as clam chowder goes. Salty, thick, and steaming hot with decent chunks of clam throughout. There were a few underdone potato chunks scattered in my portion, but nothing offensive. I have to say, I may just not be a fan of chowder myself. Fish sandwich: man this was good. The fish was undoubtedly fresh, battered and deep fried. Served on a soft bun with lettuce, tomato, and some kind of yummy sauce. It was a generous portion of fish with a thick crispy batter. I wish I would have gotten this with a serving of fries in lieu of the chowder. (They had lobster poutine today, I definitely missed out!)Over all, decent price for delicious food. I would definitely recommend this to any friend visiting in Boston.> So I really must say this was a killer lobster roll,This location is a must see ,Really nice place to just seat down and eat in a market not a restaurant,But you can see the lobster and many fresh fish,They even tell you what boat brought them the fish.Friendly staff.> Came in to get some lunch and get my parking ticket validated from some errands I had to run at city hall, I got the $9 fish sandwich and honestly wasn't expecting much. I waited only like 10 mins and then was given this beautiful hot crunchy amazing fish sandwich that tasted light and fresh! Honestly shocked and amazed about the price and quality of this place. Definitely turned into a happy accident and I definitely will be back to try the rest of this delicious looking menu! Thanks you for the pleasant surprise and great customer service! I will be back with friends :)> Red's Best Seafood is a seafood vendor inside of the Boston Public Market on 100 Hanover Street, a block over from Haymarket Station. In addition to the fresh seafoods sourced from the famous seaports that you can purchase by the pound, you can also order up hot items such as seafood (fish or scallop) tacos, buttered lobster rolls, crab cakes, fish and chips, fried oysters, fried scallops, and other items. The soups that you can order are the clam chowder and the lobster bisque. You can order freshly shucked oysters and clams in addition to steamed lobster. Instead of the lobster roll, I prefer the lobster over kale. This is a prepared item that you can grab and go rather in the refrigerated section. There is also sliced salmon and sliced tuna salad. When I head over to the Boston Public Market for lunch, I tend to go for the sushi and the poke bowls. My favorite roll is the crunchy salmon roll with crispy salmon skin on top. My next favorite is the spicy salmon. The spicy tuna had to be the spiciest spicy tuna maki I have ever tried. The fiery red color is no joke. Not the prettiest rolls but the fish is always fresh and tasty. My favorite poke bowl is the crab meat poke bowl. This bowl has plenty of crab meat with a spicy mayonnaise dressing. There is a small amount of cucumbers and thin slices of avocados as well. I haven't tried the other poke bowls since the portion  are small for the price. I feel like there isn't enough protein (fish) to justify the price. Which makes me always go for the spicy crab bowl. Overall, this place has great quality sushi that you shouldn't skip over. Red's Best also uses real wasabi and not the powder tube wasabi. And if you have had the real stuff, it's actually much more pleasant than the powder variety and not as spicy. See my pictures.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

Their food and drinks are delicious!!! I love everything on their menu.The architecture is definitely high end, it's an amazing restaurant for a date or a special occasion.  I always recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family!!! If you are in the area definitely give them a try!> I've been to the Somerville location a couple times and enjoyed it, so I was excited to try the South End location with my coworkers. Boy were we all veryy disappointed. First of all, they didn't have any normal bourbon or whiskey at the bar- only sweet flavored whiskey. And no normal vodka or Tito's- only infused vodka. So if you're looking to drink anything other than wine or beer don't go here. 2) the food wasn't as good as the other location. We got the tator tots special that came with some kind of Korean sauce on top. In my opinion it didn't go well together and just plain tots would have been better. Then we tried two pizzas. One was the potato head pizza and the other the Brie and Apple pizza. The Brie and Apple pizza was so sweet that I didn't want more than a few bites. The potato pizza we were all super excited about, but was disappointed that the potato's were chips- was excepting more of a soft potato. Also the sauce  tasted like ketchup. And the dough less than mediocre Very confused on how two locations can have totally different experiences.Also we made reservations. When we got there it was pretty empty but the hostess still sat us all the way in the back by the bathrooms at the worst table. We asked to move since there was other tables open. So strange> Great food. Very good service!  Great selections of beers and ciders.  Close to northeastern so we go  often when visited hi2/2/20.  Just had brunch.  Out of this world.  Amazing!!!! Everything is so good!!!  Best egg sandwich on thyme  basic!!!  Never had  better. You mUst go!!!> I stopped in for dinner with some friends. Although this was my first time going to the South End location, I've been to the Somerville restaurant a few times. I started off with ordering a beer on draft. Their selection is pretty extensive, and I ended up getting a Fiddlehead. I was very disappointed to find my pint glass only 60% full. Did they spill half of it on the way over or drink it? I wanted to mix it up and got a veggie burger. The tomato marmalade made this veggie burger a must-try. I ordered the greens as my one side, but it was all wilted and brown lettuce. Gross. The server was super friendly, but not very fast. Our drinks were frequently empty for more than 10 minutes at a time (not helped by the skimpy pours). Overall, one star for the extensive beer menu and two stars for the delicious veggie burger. Without the burger, this would've been a one-star experience... that is not on par with how the  Somerville location operates.> Sweet name and even better food!  Running off of fumes and a terrible hangover, my friends and I stopped in for brunch.  I got a mimosa and a red sangria -  both were delicious but the sangria gives you more bang for the buck.  It was very unique - kind of like a cold apple pie in a glass (yes very diff yet delicious flavor!) with heavy notes of cinnamon that landed perfectly -- so much so In fact that after one taste, the whole table followed suit and ordered one!For my meal I got the fried chicken salad w a side of potatoes.  Though it would be basic but somehow managed to rock my world!  The chicken was crispy yet light and extremely flavorful. The picked onions paired perfectly and the sauce on it was minimal but managed to add the best tangy punch.  The hash browns were mediocre but gave me the starch I needed for another day of holiday drinking.

Came around lunch time on a Saturday and found it to not be crowded at all, with very short lines. Ended up trying a lot sandwich from Mamalehs. The only thing is that overall the food here is very expensive... but I mean, Boston.Got the bagel lox on an everything bagel. So good. The capers were kind of overwhelming so I didn't eat them.> The prices simply do not match the quality of food.The pizza from Monti was honesty some of the worst pizza I've had. You'd be better off going to dominos.The soup from Mrs Clucks was just okay. You can go down the road to Hojoku and pay the same price for their amazing Funky Chicken Ramen.Union Square Donuts are 5/5 stars.> Gets a lot of press from places like eater.com and such. But just conceptually doesn't match reality. You can easily blow through your savings and not get full, or not get a great meal. And likely that dough is paying for some overpriced rent some bigshot developer is making a killing on. The space is laid out rather cavernously - rows upon rows of tables and chairs, all lined out in a super organized fashion (as a buddy puts it, like a mess hall in a military barracks).I've reviewed the individual establishments in other entries, but I'll summarize by saying that I wasn't impressed with many of the dishes I had. Usually too salty, too fried with portions lacking or too small.> The amount of food options available makes time out market so enticing- I usually just find myself wandering thinking of what I want to eat. I think there's something for everyone here. It's also noticeable how high the prices are. I don't really mind paying a lot for something amazing. But I don't want to pay a lot for something that's just ok. Sadly I've found some items here have been just ok, which is a bummer. Tables get really crowded but there's some outdoor seating.> Super cool concept, cooler if you have a large wallet. The most wallet friendly restaurant has to be Mamaleh's. They havE really good bagel sanwidches, but the best in my opinion is the Leo sandwich served on  toasted challah breadd! It has caramelized onions, eggs and lox and dill mayo, super tasty and satisfying. Ms clucks' soup and dumplings is highly overrated, as the dumplings are overcooked and the soup  super bland. Make sure you grab At least two portions of chili sauce if you want some flavour. Gelato and chill is not bad, but you can definitely find better at MUCH BETTER prices. They do however have some interesting flavors worth trying (eg plum)","4, 3, 2, 3, 4"

I usually go with the sausage garlic cheese unless I'm hungrier, I'll get ""The Works"" which is my favorite. If you don't like anchovies just make sure you ask for none. This is easily top 3 pizzas I've had in Boston.> The food? Great. Awesome tasting pizza. I ordered a half shrimp scampi / italian sausage pizza and two skewers - lamb and steak tips. The shrimp scampi literally tasted like pasta. It was absolutely delectable. We ordered the skewers initially and were served with one huge skewer and half a loaf of bread. Super filling! Service? One does not come here to be wined and dined. The reason I give this place three-stars is for the food. It's the only redeeming quality. I'm not sure if we had come on a bad day or what but the woman who served us at the bar was borderline rude. She may have been the owner who knows. I even witnessed a server sneeze on a pizza he was about to serve. Now I get that this place is a local joint and probably has a cult following but c'mon, get with the times. I'm a lover of hole in the wall places, but the lack of service or welcome-ness left a bad taste in my mouth.> If you want a real Boston pie with that true Boston feel, Santarpio's is the place. It's legendary and you'll see why the moment your pizza hits the table. Or, you can order take out and wait in the kitchen while it's made. This is the real deal. Heck-it's even worth being late for a flight for when you're on the way to the airport! The only thing more Boston is Bobby Orr himself! Dig in!> This is very much a local's place, and I am not a local, with that said - it is definitely a place you should go if you want a taste of authentic old school East Boston Italian. You don't get places like this very often in the world today, so you have to treasure them. Very welcoming, very casual. I had the steak tips with the hot peppers, could've gone with the pizza and been very happy. This place is been here since the early 1900s, and hopefully for a long time going forward","5, 5, 3, 5, 5"

The place did not disappoint. Great breakfast sandwich, I appreciated the ability to replace bacon with a spicy guac and no upcharge (quickly checks receipt to make sure I'm telling the truth!). The focaccia was soft and everything else pulled together nicely. I had to have the famous sticky buns and they did not disappoint. They were not overly sticky, which my teeth and my dental hygienist appreciate. Ironically enough, I skipped my dental cleaning today, double win!!To top it off, staff was super nice, I asked newbie questions and didn't receive a hint of attitude. Will be back here, maybe later today!> I went back to Flour in the Back Bay and the sandwiches I bought were excellent as usual. I also bought the recently published Flour baking and savory recipe cook book for my Dad for Xmass and he loved it ! I had the tuna on Focaccia and really like the rustic  "" tapenade "" they added, but it seemed like a few crushed marinated green olives. High quality olives, which was nice. I just feel it would be better to have a layer of tapenade on the bottom. The hummus with pickled vegetables was good, great hummus and scallion foccacia, but I'm not a huge fan of pickled daikon. Next time I'll request that they omit it. Pickled red peppers were amazing. The few pickled red onions were a nice addition. I'd do pickled garlic, tomato, and shallot too, but that's just me - maybe some pickled persian cucumbers.  I also think, and please no offense meant, that black fermented garlic would be pretty stellar on this. I've had black garlic from food  purveyor or Sid rep, and it was really, really good. I think it's fermented but I'm not sure, and although the rep was pretty rude to me otherwise after swanning into our commissary  and making fun of me ( I was was using a really cheap Knife really quickly on a steel prep table surface because my fucking feet hurt too much to go get a board, and evidentally he found the site of me sprinkling a pizza with shredded "" mozarella "" directly on the prep table pretty objectionable. ) Was it the fact that it was Syco "" cheese "" that he didn't like ?!Always nice to know a food rep will come in an critique your performance although apparently he no longer cooks professionally ! I suppose he wanted us to buy the top shelf cheese he had. The sneering was going to make the sale in his mind. Like shooting fish in barrel, amirite ?!> I'm team Flour all the way. I always find everything so wonderfully imaginatively delicious and creative. When I come to town lately, I tend to stop by this location as it is close to the airport and my friend's office. Luckily, he obliges me when I say I prefer Flour over Sweetgreen. Since I hadn't done vegetarian all week, I opted for the grilled cauliflower melt. My friend tried the chicken and broccoli-rabe panini. We split the tophat cupcake which I had been eyeing for weeks. We were both surprised at the texture of the frosting. It was light and creamy and lovely with crushed peppermint candies on top. The cake itself was very moist but too crumbly. Seating can be tough and it seems to be the case no matter when we go. It's always as we leave, things seem to die down and there is more space.> Ordered a Boston Cream Pie since many Yelpers raved about it. It tasted like tiramisu. Someone didn't clean the bowl! Texture was good. I thoroughly enjoyed the chewy ganache. However, if I wanted tiramisu I would have ordered that. For $6 I was disappointed with the quality. Service was nice. They don't rush.

I had a craving for scallion pancakes when we paid for our bill so I ordered some to go - the waitstaff was extremely respectful and sweet throughout the dinner, but they were not close to the best scallion pancakes I've had before.> Just had lunch here, the food was good. We had the chicken satay, pad see ew of roasted pork, and massaman curry. The place smells a bit funky but I guess it's that typical smell.... the place could be updated since it felt a bit old.

Yes, it was lunch time, but there were tables available so they weren't super busy. Yes, I ordered a few dishes (maybe 8 or so-for coworkers) and we were all disappointed that they 1) told us they needed more advance notice for a delivery but we could pick-up and then 2) we needed to wait twice as long as they said for a pick-up. The food was normal, I had the Drunken Chicken and it was tasty, so no complaints about the food, really.> The place is nice and quiet. Although their thai food is very good to taste, there are some improvements that can make the food taste delicious. Food: I loved their peanut sauce along with veggie fresh rolls. The Thai broccoli is delicious. The blend of spices in Basil fried rice is very well. However, the tofu was slightly over fried. The pineapple fried rice lacked the right blend of spices. The panang curry was mouth watering, but they could try a provide more curry to go with the rice. If you plan to order any of the above, then perhaps you can ask let them know before hand. Overall the food and service is very good. I would give the extra 1 star for the service. Alcohol: They have a good collection of wine and some nice local Thailand beers.> A great Thai restaurant.

Given the popularity of this place (likely only increased by this accolade), I wasn't able to book a reservation and resorted to looking at other options. I was delighted to learn later, this is owned by the same person. The waitress guided us through the menu, pointing us to the star items. We were happy that we made some modifications based on her recommendations, as our meal was delicious. We ordered both the carbinera  and the seafood pasta and split them. The taste of both grows on you throughout the meal--then they are addicting and it's hard to stop eating. The bread was warm and exceptionally tasty. This is always a problem for me because I want to fill myself up on it before the meal comes. We selected a full-bodied bottle of wine that was $35. This was my favorite wine I'd had in a while. Great value--I would pay near twice that to purchase it at a winery. I love the added details in the decor. The washrooms have WWF wrestlers on the doors :) Excellent service. We were attended to through out the night--never had an empty glass of water or wine glass. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening looking out the window into the raining Tuesday evening.> Food yes. Staff, namely bartender Stacy and the woman who gave me a dirty look when I was attempting to move through the restaurant. I understand people have rough nights or have personal issues but this woman made 0 effort for me to feel welcome and everyone around me. She made faces, was rude, not very attentive, and clearly did not want to be there. Luckily, again, I'm a tourist so I don't have to come back nor would I recommend if you're looking for a relaxing welcoming bar atmosphere.> If you're starving and looking for reasonably priced pasta in the North End, you've come to the right spot. This place caught my interest as the sister restaurant to Carmelina's, so I'd been looking forward to checking it out. We left extremely full and still had boxes of leftovers.The restaurant lacks a certain ambiance, there are big bar TVs and tiny tables with plastic plates. It was a little tight sitting at the table for two. Not really great for a romantic date, but better for casual or group dinners. Our waitress was very friendly and gave several useful recommendations.And now for the food! The restaurant has a southern Italian cooking style. We got the fried caprese appetizer, which had a really unique combination of flavors. The mozzarella and tomatoes were both fried, served with a pesto that may have had a hint of mint in it, as well as pickled vegetables. Overall - super tasty. I ordered the crazy alfredo pasta per the waitress's recommendation, which was also a nice surprise with a spicer cheese sauce -- definitely had a nice kick to it. There was sausage, chicken and red peppers in the dish, which you can see in the pictures is a huge portion that comes out in an entire pan like all the pastas. We also ordered the bolognese, which tasted like it may have been cooked in some wine sauce -- also delicious and a huge portion. Overall I was impressed with the food quantity and quality, especially for the price.> I was in Boston for a work trip, staying in the Seaport area and my sister and I were looking for a place to dine that evening. Originally from the Boston area, one of our favorite places to eat is the north end a.k.a. Little Italy. There's a lot of restaurants that she and I have already dined that and we wanted a new experience. I checked in with Yelp to see what was one of the top rated restaurants that you were able to make reservations with. A lot of the restaurants in the North End are small and don't take reservations. To my surprise and extreme luck, Domenic's did take reservations and had a spot available for us that evening. I booked our reservation a few weeks prior, to ensure we were able to get the time we wanted. We had both worked all day and we were famished. It was a Saturday evening, and we were looking to really mow down on some authentic, Italian food. It was our cheat night. Also, being of Italian descent, pasta is something we get a little serious about. Upon arrival, we told the hostess we had a reservation and we did not have to wait at all. I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't as busy as expected. We got a beautiful, two-seater right by the window so we could people watch and taking the streets of Little Italy in Boston. We were approached almost right away by our incredible server, Alexandra. She was great and helped us navigate through all of the incredible options that they offered. They do have their liquor license but their vodka is flavored, although they do have the Skinny Girl vodka. I took this as an opportunity to order something different. While my sister started with a cosmopolitan and then ended on champagne, I ordered two Negroni's made with vodka, Campari, and soda water drinks. They were served with sphere shaped ice in a bourbon glass. My first cocktail was less than halfway full, my second cocktail was nearly all the way full when served. I guess they started really liking us :-). We ordered a few appetizers, and decided to split our meal. There is so much great food items to choose from. We also took advice from our wonderful server, Alexandra. There was another girl who came over as the restaurant started getting busy, and I'm so sad that I didn't get her name. She came over and gave us a lot of great advice on the menu as well. We ended up ordering the Cabonara pasta dish that she recommended and it was, no exaggeration, the best pasta I've ever tasted in my life. Definitely filling and I would recommend sharing. She explained that carbonara is supposed to be made by cracking an egg, and that should add to the base of the sauce, not by using a cream sauce. She also gave us a name of a place that we could get incredible desserts from Everett. She said ""ask for Tony."" We haven't been there yet but I always like to take a recommendation.The bread was absolutely delicious and the complimentary olive oil and balsamic was incredible. Alexandra told us we could get the same kind from Monica's down the street. Right after we left, we picked up the olive oil and I now use it for everything. Cooking, salads, etc. We decided to split the house salad, the steak with a side of charred broccoli rapini, and the carbonara pasta dish. It was the perfect order. We thought long and hard about it because we wanted to get a mixture of everything. The steak was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly, the rapini was a perfect accent mixed with the potatoes was pure heaven. I can't say enough about this place. I love the ambience, the location, the service, the drinks, appetizers, and especially the meals. I will definitely be coming back here and likely ordering the same thing. They also have specials and that evening they had the ""Dom burger"" that looked delicious and the servers both said it was incredible. Although they totally understand coming to an Italian restaurant and ordering a burger is not common. I would recommend taking a rideshare service as parking is very sparse to impossible in the North End area. Also, if you are looking to doing some shopping a lot of them, like Mike's Pastry (down the street) which is a total desert staple and only takes cash. Enjoy and come hungry!> I went into a food coma after eating this gnocchi! Decadent layers of cheese and the pasta is so soft. I do have to say that the ambience is unusual compared to other Italian restaurants in Northend","5, 3, 4, 5, 4"

Despite taking out a lot of the garlic, it still overpowered the other spices. The menu is quite limited, but the items they do have are all cooked very well. Wish I could support them during the COVID-19 crisis, but unfortunately I am not in the area, so everyone else should go to Gene's to pick up some delicious Chinese comfort food!> Gene's flatbread is a little hole in the wall a short walk away from Downtown Crossing. It's a small restaurant with few tables and a small selection but my friends and I have always heard great things so we decided to check it out.Their menu isnt expansive but we got the cumin lamb hand pulled noodles, the hot and sour wonton soup, the pork flatbread, and the house noodle soup. The cumin hand pulled noodles were great. The noodles had a thick and slightly chewy texture and had a really nice flavor among with the lamb, bean sprouts, carrots and onions. Almost slightly spicy with some lemon. It's only 9 dollars and great in taste but wont really fill you up.My friends ordered the other items so I only got to taste. The dumpling soup was good but not great. You can tell it's made in house but they werent anything special. The broth was tasty but not as tasty as the house noodle soup, which has a phenomenal broth but normal rice noodles. The pork bun was standard. Nothing I'd say I'd recommend but a nice little snack if you're hungry.Overall, Gene's is definitely worth a try. Cheap with some great items, but it wont really keep you full unless you order more than one dish> After seeing Gene's on a recent Eater list, it was on my radar to try but the limited hours (closes at 7 most days) complicated my plans. I finally made it for a weekday lunch this week and really enjoyed the hand pulled noodles and single lamb skewer. The value was incredible ($8.50 for everything), service was prompt, and environment is super causal - epitome of hole in the wall.Both the noodles and lamb skewer were packed to the brim with flavor and spice, and I cannot wait time try the cold salad and the flatbread. Others who arrived after me ordered both and my mouth was watering even though I had just eaten terrific food and was full. The dumpling soup that had recently been added to the menu was also enticing - motivation to come back again soon :)I will say that the hand pulled noodles were tasty overall but not cooked 100% perfectly so some bites were a bit chewy. Not a major issue and didn't get in the way of me loving the meal, but just a small area for improvement to make every bite flawless.Will definitely be back soon!> I LOVED this place! Came on a Saturday afternoon, no lines. I got the hand pulled noodles, hot and sour hand pulled noodles, the skewers, and the pork sandwich. I liked the spicy hand pulled noodles the best. The soup one was great too, but I liked the regular one better. They were both pretty spicy. The sandwich was a little dry, but the skewers weren't, they were SO GOOD. Would def recommend. Everything was so cheap, our entire meal was $23. It was also way way more filling than I expected. The noodles are very thick. I loved it, I would def come back.> Cash only. Small hole in the wall. They're known for their hand pulled noodles. I got the hand pulled noodles with chili oil and a tea egg. The texture of the noodles had a nice chew to it. Only downside was that there was literally no broth to my noodles. The chili oil wasn't so much of chili oil but chili powder. Because the noodles did not have any broth and the chili was not oil, it was kind of hard eating the last half since the chili powder made it so dry with a chalky taste. Not comparable to other places I have tried but I would go back and try their hot and sour noodle soup if I ever come back to Boston.","4, 4, 5, 4, 4"

My roommate and I live in the North End and so have made it our mission to try all of the restaurants in the neighborhood. Of the four new ones we've tried and some of our usual spots including some of the big names in the neighborhood Table has become our new favorite! We ordered the prosciutto wrapped burrata as a starter and it was fantastic. Great balance of creamy burrata and perfectly cured prosciutto with a distinctly flavorful pesto and tossed with heirloom tomatoes! The main attraction were the meatballs Best meatballs in the north end! Not sure if it's that housemade marinara with the hints of basil or the choice of both veal and pork that made it really stand out compared to every where else, but WOW. Hours laters we're still talking about our return. Excited to actually sit down at a 'Table' real soon!!!> The owner and staff of this place are providing a take out/delivery option during these tumultuous times. My boyfriend and I decided to support local business and enjoy Italian comfort food after some very uncomfortable days, and order delivery from Table via chownow (something they're recommending via their Instagram account, and something I've been following eagerly, waiting to try). I'll just shoot it to you straight - I have never in my life been spoken to the way the owner spoke to me on the phone after calling about an order that THEY messed up. After swearing several times, saying ""ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU'RE CALLING ABOUT TWO FUCKING MEATBALLS!?"" I didn't even get a chance to let her know that this meal is a splurge for us at upwards of $65. That said - yes, I ordered the rigatoni with meatballs, yes, chownow says the Marsala comes with penne - so why in God's name are you screaming at me when I'm simply inquiring to get what we paid for?Before people read through this, I'll have you know I NEVER raised my voice to this woman, mostly because I didn't have a chance to get a word in. Never mind the eggshell in our dish, I wasn't even going to mention that, because quite frankly shit happens (meatballs go missing, eggshells sometimes fall into the food, Jen), but how you handle it is a whole other story. So just a quick thank you for making an extremely shitty week, that much worse for two hardworking people who have been waiting to try your restaurant. As a couple with a vast, foodie network, not only do I hope you give us that refund tomorrow, but I also hope you can extend a heartfelt apology, because you've absolutely ruined our evening - not with missing meatballs, but with how you think you speak to another human being.> Haven't left a review in a while... but this experience was one I wanted to share. I had heard about this place when it first opened up, and have been waiting for a special occasion to splurge & try it out because I think the concept is great. I had been talking about this place for the longest time to friends & family and I was super bummed to report back about my overall experience to everyone.  I visited here with a friend two weeks ago for a late Christmas/New Year's dinner. The decor, & set up of the tables walking in is super cute. Definitely a vibe. They left the lights really bright for dinner which was kind of meh, would set a nice ambiance if lights were dim. Not a big deal, but you also couldn't hear the music very well, it is a small space & all the reservations were chatting so it gets loud. My understanding was that you share a table with others, but the courses come out for your and your party. It was set up to groups of 6. So we a party of 2 were seated with a party of 4. So the food that came out was portioned for 6 guests.The servers were polite, when we got there, we were checked in for our reservation. I would like to point out, that I didn't have open table until I had to make a reservation for the specific restaurant so I downloaded it. Apparently there is a reward system and you get points for going to restaurants that you make reservations for, I will circle back to this point later .We ordered 2 glasses of wine, & my friend then ordered a $55 bottle of wine. When we got to the table there was bread and garlic and olives, it was actually really tasty for me it was actually the tastiest thing of the entire night. There was nine courses I believe, and I have to say that everything that came out for my personal palate was bland, basic & underwhelming small portions for the $90 per person. The menu was a mixture of so many different things, There was a certain point where I kind of wanted it to be over but I was looking forward to the salad, and when the salad came out it was literally arugula doused in oil with some sunflower seeds. No flavor whatsoever. Again I was so looking forward to trying this place out so I don't know if my expectations were really high.I personally didn't eat a lot of the things that came out & pretty much a lot of it was still on my plate at the end of the night when it was cleared. Which is a cue in most restaurants for servers to at least ask if everything tasted ok. The bill came and we just dished out almost $300 for a meal that I was walking away hungry from. I went on the review outlets and noticed that the majority of the reviews are five stars which is great if other guests have had five star experiences when visiting. I noticed those who had lesser experiences expressed the same / similar experiences as we did. I actually work in reputation management for restaurants, and I was reading the emotional responses that the owner had to those who did not think that her restaurant offers a five-star experience. I decided not to leave a review at the time, but my friend decided to leave one on Google. Again I'm in repetition management for restaurants, so I have seen & responded to all sorts of reviews on behalf of restaurants. The owner responded back taking the review personally, And decided to go to open table to cancel my reservation so that I would lose the points that I had rightfully earned for committing to the reservation, showing up and paying $300 for a meal with gratuity. This reaction disappointed me even more & is why I am leaving this review. My friend left that review not me, and the unprofessional emotional reaction was mind boggling to me. i get as small business owners their passion is their purpose, but first and foremost entrepreneurs are running a BUSINESS. Feedback positive or negative is going to happen, it shouldn't be taken personal, but from a reputation management perspective should certainly be handled with tact. The establishment had no problem taking my $, but decided to take away the points as what? Retribution? Retaliation? To be honest it's not about the money, its about how your guests feel when they leave, &  its about providing VALUE for the price you are charging. The $ invested did not give me any value. I walked out hungry. I will never go back. Try it if you want, but foodie beware.> I have been wanting to go here for a long time but being from outside the city...I had avoided it. Last week the online photo's of the new antipasto struck my fancy and after a week of debating I placed my order online, selected pickup time, paid and received confirmation. I arrived right in time and I was greeted as I went in. My order was ready, checked and rechecked and I was offered silverware before I left. I wondered if it would look the same as the Instagram photo I had seen. Much to my surprise if made it home looking just as good. The portion was more than generous. It stated for two but was lunch for over 2 days. The cannoli's were well worth it. Note this review is simply of takeout...I have not been for their traditional dinner but when they reopen for that..I'll be back!> Owner called people the C word, published an add asking for a non Spanish speaking dishwasher she has horrible food and a worse attitude","5, 1, 1, 5, 1"

We didn't want something super touristy or super expensive, and this was perfect! We looked at the menu outside for a moment and were greeted by an employee asking if we had any questions. She wasn't pushy or salesy but made us feel welcome and we decided to dine. Three of us shared a Buddha of Mai Tai. It's 64oz (so ~4 servings) and dangerously easy to drink. We failed to take pictures but all had delicious meals. I had the Snow Mountain maki and spicy tuna maki. The snow mountain had bacon bits and a wonderful sauce, I loved it. Warning, the spicy tuna definitely had more heat to it than most other places so it IS spicy but yummy. The others had Walnut Chili Shrimp and Yellowfin Tuna. Despite how full we were, we shared a chocolate torte at the end. It was small but very rich and therefore a perfect little ending to a wonderful meal. The only downside was the combination of dim lighting and a graphically textured menu - it made it a bit hard to read. Otherwise though, I definitely recommend as a great somewhat hidden gem in a populated area!> Came here for galentine's with two other girl friends and we ordered the scallion pancake, street noodles, walnut chili shrimp, and an unagi roll. We all enjoyed the unagi roll and street noodles the most, followed by the scallion pancake and walnut chili shrimp (which we didn't really like) in that order. Portion sizes were pretty standard, and we were all very full after finishing most of our four dishes. The decor of the restaurant is definitely on point, and service was also great. We had a reservation for 3, and were seated upon arrival. Overall, I think Koy is a great place to check out if you're in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.> The goodWhile small the drinks were solidMusic was fine (both stylistically and volume)The BBQ sauce had a nice sweet smoky heat that was not overwhelmingThe bibimbap kept a good heat in the stone bowl but wasn't too flavorfulThe staff was very attentiveThe badOne of the worst salmon rolls I've ever had.

Don't think I will rush back> BANG BANG CAULIFLOWERBattered florets, sweet honey chili sauceThe portion was a bit light for the $9 price tag.  But it tasted good.  It was soft, and light beneath the batter with a bit of heat due to the sauce, which reminded my mom somewhat of Thousand Island dressing.***Might have to give their $1 House Dumplings night a try sometime.  It is on Monday nights after 5pm.  They have the following flavors listed on the dinner menu:CHEESE STEAKPastrami, Swiss, Kimchi, bacon, spicy mayoKOREAN MANDUPan seared beef + tofu, scallion, sesame soy sauceLOBSTER RANGOONSFresh knuckle meat, cream cheese, sweet chili sauceSWEET & SOUR PORKSweet soy + honey glaze, shredded carrot, scallionVEGETABLE MANDUSeasonal vegetables, crispy wonton, sesame soy sauceBUFFALO CHICKEN DUMPLINGSShredded chicken, cream cheese, sriracha buffalo sauce> I convinced a coworker to try soju via their cocktail and he loved it -- now to get him to drink a bottle...We had the bang bang cauliflower (thank you everywhere for using cauliflower in place of chicken) which could have been spicier for our group but was still delicious and sticky. The pajon was not crispy enough for my liking, but was still flavorful. I finished with bibimbap and they had to bring more gojuchung out for us. I asked for the squirt bottle and they looked at me like I had 5 heads :) Staff was quick with bringing out more little bowls though.","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

The soup tasted incredibly savory and fresh (because it's seafood, freshness is key). Came with a packet of oyster crackers.They were giving out free samples of the clam chowder so if you're on the fence about getting it, see if you can't try it first. I know it won't disappoint ;).For me, the small at $5.99 was just the right size for a mid-day snack and it's also pretty affordable. If only I had more room in my stomach, I would have definitely gotten it in a bread bowl, yum!They also have lobster rolls and various types of seafood pies, although the lobster roll is a little outside of my price range. Regardless, I'll definitely have to come back and try some of their other menu items.> The chowder was so good! It came in a meal with the butter lobster roll. I enjoyed the chowda waay more than the roll. Locals probably think it's so basic, but we don't have anything like this one in Sonoma. I'm definitely a fan of the marketplace in Faneuil Hall. I think this place wouldn't be the same without Boston Chowda. Walk and eat or find a place to stand. The market was packed both times I went. So let's talk about that roll though. Lots of lobster pieces stacked on each other stuffed in a bread roll. Lightly buttered and some sort of toasty ness from the texture. It all came together pretty well, but it was extremely dry. I was hoping for the lobster roll to be warm and buttery. Sadly not. It is crazy expensive too. $25 for this meal. Not worth it. Next time I can ditch the lobster roll and cut the cost by two hundred percent.> This was my fist time visiting this specific place and came here specifically for the lobster rolls and and I was not disappointed. It is located inside the Faneuil Hall, I have been there in the past but never inside and I heard and seen the reviews and I was glad I tried it. It is on the pricier side but I was out there visiting and wanted to taste the lobster rolls. I also ordered a side of clam chowder, nothing special but still very good and tasty. Since the Faneuil Hall is big we found seating on the second floor it was quite and we had some natural sunlight come in thru the big windows which kept us nice and warm. There's plenty of places to try lobsters roll inside the market but I am glad I tried this one in particular. The are fast and good.> While visiting Boston in a really chilly weather, we were feeling like getting a nice cup of soup. What's better than soup? Chowder! What's better than a cup of soup? Chowder in a bread bowl!!! You have some good options when you are at Faneuil Hall, and I heard Boston Chowda does really nice bread bowl. So, we decided to get one from there. Also, their lobster roll on the display looked amazing, so we decided to get that too. We got the New England Clam Chowda in Bread Bowl. The bread bowl was a nice size, and it was surprisingly good. Chowder was good too, lots of little potatoes. Creamy and comforting, great on a cold day! Hot Buttered Lobster Roll is their signature sandwich. It didn't look like the display, the one on display had maybe twice as much lobster meat in there... Anyways, it was sooo buttery! It still had a nice amount of lobster meat, soft and juicy. However, one of the lobster meat had big shells attached to it, which was annoying... Other than that, it was very tasty! It was the perfect lunch for us, exactly what we wanted. The price was affordable too. Nice spot to try some Boston lobster roll and clam chowder!> We were planning a trip to Faneuil Hall and once I saw that Boston Chowda Company served bread bowls, I was in. We arrived around 10:00 AM right before the huge lunch rush so we were able to order and get served in about 5 minutes. Once you leave with your meal, your best bet is to immediately turn to the right and grab one of the standing tables. It's less crowded and still easy to enjoy your chowder at. My New England clam chowder was really satisfying. It was piping hot and chock full of clams in every bite. The bread bowl was the perfect vessel for every creamy bite. The bread bowl had a nice chew to it and tasted freshly baked.My boyfriend had the lobster bisque, and while tasty, he didn't find even the smallest piece of lobster in it. I don't know if they just purée the lobster into it and that's why there were no chunks, or maybe he was just unlucky.Our total for two bread bowls and two fountain sodas was around $25. We were definitely stuffed after, so I would say this is one of the better ""bang for your buck"" restaurants at Faneuil Hall.","5, 3, 4, 4, 4"

We wanted to really love this place and had been looking forward to going.   They say to always start with the positive...The wine list is rather good and pretty reasonably price with a vast selection and unique wines;The location is just superb and the restaurant itself is very nice, not to mention the view is exceptional. Keeping the deltas short and to the point.   Waitress was terrible as she kept disappearing for very long periods of time and we seemed to be interrupting her each time she came to the table - which usually required us asking the support staff to have our waitress come to the table. We received far better service  from the support staff - thank you again to David who at least tried to help.  The menu is creative but lacking at the same time. The pastas are bland, lamb is just plain and poorly prepared with some sort of attempt at a soy sauce, charred broccoli was very good but the cheese sauce was overbearing and way too much, the steak was gross albeit cooked as ordered, beet salad was just ok but almost tasted like a refrigerator.  Hot dishes we not serviced hot.  5 of us for dinner, couple of bottles of wine was just over 140 a person with tip.  Given the quality of food and terrible service from the waitress,  I'd say we all left very disappointed, underwhelmed and wanting a much better experience from one of Boston's newest restaurants in the Seaport.> I know you have heard about the New England lobster rolls, but have you tried the lobster popover here?

We were a little concerned when we walked in, the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately. The food was outstanding. The drinks were well balanced. Although we thought our waiter was a little unenthusiastic compared to the others on staff, he surprised us with a free dessert, after finding out we had just been married. We had a lovely time, and this really made our honeymoon unforgettable. We already have plans on another Boston trip - that includes a dinner at the Mistral!> I came to Mistral with a colleague for dinner when we were attending a conference. The staff were accommodating that we were a bit late for our reservation, which was appreciated. The decor combines an intimate, dimly lit aesthetic with classic furniture. Highlights on the meal:-Our -The steak carpaccio was an enjoyable dish with small bread pieces throughout, although the meat itself and the herbs stole the show. -Linguine was super fresh and exploding with flavor up front -I enjoyed the blueberry tart as well. I perhaps ate it too quickly as it was gone before I knew it!Our server, Tiffany, was very friendly and helpful. She offered a tasting between two reds that I was vacillating between (I preferred the Campo al Mare Bolgheri). The folks at the table next to us were super sociable and added to the lightness of the environment, which is always welcome at a white table cloth restaurant. Mistral was veritably enjoyable, and I would certainly come back.> I haven't lived in Boston for 3 years now but I still hold Mistral up as THE golden standard for brunch. The food is delicious and the presentation is absolutely beautiful. I love the huge windows and high ceilings. In my opinion the price is definitely worth the VIP treatment you get here.> My two teenage daughters and I went on a recent Sunday morning for a late breakfast.

To be honest, I've never heard of it. I'm from Atlanta, so I guess not a chain we have.First, I really hate to read reviews that complain about cleanliness for paragraphs. There was an obvious odor when I walked in. An employee came out quickly and it was obvious he was trying to find the source. Garbage cans were emptied and that seem to solve it.I had the 1/4 lb with cheese and a few other condiments. Of course fries to solve the craving. Overall, both were excellent. The burger is a great size and was very filling. The burger had a fantastic char from the flattop covered by a fresh bun. Fries were fresh and well seasoned. Since I'm in Boston on a regular basis, looks like I found a new burger spot.> Ordered from Mooyah many times in 2020 thus far, my go-to burger place for a solid meal. Only real downside is the large portions they offer (not a real downside in my mind, but my body says differently after the meal!). Orders always arrive quickly, food usually arrives still warm which is impressive as the restaurant is about 4-5 miles away from Southie. Generally, I get the same meal every time I order from MOOYAH - Mooyah Double Cheeseburger (with all the onion options, bacon, and a heap of other add-ins) with a side of family fries. Rarely do I eat the entire meal, but everything is delicious. From the crispness of the bacon, to the well done cooked burger to the crispness of the bun, there is little left needed. Add in the fries, can't ask for a much better meal (albeit probably contains a million calories but who cares!). My go-to burger place in Boston, would rate a 4.5/5 if possible. Will order again (probably soon!).> Yes, they forgot the sauces I had requested on the side, and yes, my burger arrived stuffed within a potato roll when I had ordered it with an Iceburger bun.  But their response was quick when I asked for the sauce, and their attitude was terrific when I mentioned the error and asked for the lettuce ""bun"" - the fellow manning the cash register offered that they could replace the bun for me, which I realized would probably be the better idea.Once accurate, my burger was now a round ball of lettuce stuffed with a beef patty, American Cheese, sliced avocado, fried onion strings, grilled onions, pickles, and tomato.  It was a bit of a mess to eat, with the juices dribbling past the foil, but I enjoyed my hand-held salad meal.The Half Idaho & Half Sweet Potato Fries were like two side orders in their own right in any other burger shop.  Both were good, though I might suggest more salt on the regular fries if I had been doing without dunking sauce.  The sweet potato variant was the soft sort.  I enjoyed both with their Thousand Island like MOOYAH sauce.The banana shake was worthy of the pearl milk tea sized straw they gave me.I was happy with my meal.Build Your Own:Certified Angus Beef - Single $5.59 American Cheese $1.00 Sliced Avocado $1.29(all other veggies and sauces was with no charge)+ half fries/sweet potato fries+ milk shake> We stopped in Mooyah while we were getting ready to walk the Freedom Trail. Holy cow, these are amazing burgers!  We got the Cheddar Bacon Burger, the Double Diablo and the  Mushroom Swiss Burger. We loved them. They were a great value. We highly recommend this place!> If you know and love Smashburger, this is maybe one notch better. My friend and I had lunch here before a flight back home. There was no line around 1 pm on a Friday so we were able to order right away.I ordered:1. Grilled chicken sandwich with multigrain wheat bread, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, and (on the side) Mooyah sauce (Thousand Island dressing)2. Sweet potato fries3. Oreo milkshake Simply put, everything tasted utterly delectable!! (Yes, two exclamation points, for those who remember me from that episode in Netflix!!)The chicken was a huge slab, extremely fresh and flavorful, with perfectly and evenly melted cheese, vibrant lettuce and tomatoes, just enough pickled jalapenos to give it that kick, sandwiched between a delicious (and healthy!) bun. The sweet potato fries were served hot, not greasy, and nicely cooked with finger-length pieces and a delicious dipping sauce. Lip-smackin' good!I wanted two milkshakes like a glutton but one was still delicious! Perfectly blended plus visible pieces of Oreo that I scooped up voraciously with a spoon. There's also plenty of seating inside but sit strategically if you want to charge your phone. I didn't see any outlets near the upper area where we sat. Now go get some MOOYAH!

It is probably the vegetables cooked in the best possible way. ~The service is nice as well even though last time they caught forgetting to bring one out of 4 meze but we got it in the end so...count how many dishes you order and how may you get :) Desserts are small but very rich in taste. ~Again, it is a must visit place!UPD: came there again and they forgot fourth meze out of chefs choice set again :( be careful!> More like 3.5, although the score varies depending on what you order and your preference. A cozy, trendy middle eastern restaurant that pushes the wine heavy and offers a hit and miss menu that frustrates and delights. The fatteh is a beautiful construction of a dish. The layout looks like it could be a modernist house for an insect! The textured are well thought out, as there's three different types of crunch. The yogurt has a lovely tang that ties everything together. Every bite felt like a chamber orchestra in my mouth. Definitely make sure to get this.The spinach falafel was good, but not as amazing as everything else. If anything, this would be something id eat for a healthy lunch. As a vegan, this will strike your heart as hearty, nutritional, earthy vibes. I would have dialed the cumin down by one notch, but thats just me.The lamb tortellini is delicious. Each tortellini feels like a small package, specially wrapped under the Christmas tree. The flavor of the lamb shines like a pattern from a boat surrounded by a lake of labneh. The labneh itself comes off like pimento cheese sauce but in a good way. The mint oil adds a brushstroke of freshness while further anchoring the oil profile of the dish, although it never gets overwhelming. I'm glad they dont serve it piping hot, but it does get lukewarm fairly quick.The Quail kebobs were quite underwhelming for being the last item of my meal. I expected this to be small, but I wasn't expecting it to taste like chicken breast covered in a nutty parmesan pesto crust. Out of all the dishes, this one fell flat like a middle schooler's voice breaking halfway through the final note of his cadenza. The birds nest dessert was not as good as other bird's nests Ive had at other places. It felt like everything was its own separate part, rather than a total sum. The cheese board like layout of some of the ingredients feel compartmentalized, as well as incomplete as a ""nest of a bird"". The redeeming factor is everything was solid in how it tasted. No cheap chocolate, no flat flavors. The honeycomb is candy and not real honeycomb, but I honestly didn't mind since it was more about texture (and I didn't want a sugar rush as I was already full). Im really glad I didn't order the Sultan's delight prix fixe option. I have a feeling I would have scored this place much more harshly than I am now. Granted, I didn't eat every item on the menu. I think overall it's a hit or miss experience. If I lived in the neighborhood, perhaps I would be able to fully explore the menu, but alas I don't live in Boston. This would not be my first choice or recommendation to come here if you have a limited stay in Boston, but for locals, Id say its still worth going to. Just make sure you do plenty of research ahead of time.> So I'm visiting Boston and everyone says get a lobster roll...eat the clam chowder...order cannoli...and while those items were good, nothing really felt special in Boston until I ate at Oleana.   This was such a small, cozy restaurant tucked away in a residential neighborhood that we couldn't find the restaurant until we literally walked in front of it.  I don't even remember a sign...if there was, it was small.Two favorite dishes of the night were the lemon chicken and the mini butternut dolma.  For the dolma, the goat cheese and sumac work so well together and then the tomato brown butter mellows it out.  The lemon chicken was moist, had a flavorful za'atar layer on top and the cheese pancake was the perfect piece to go on the bottom.  The one disappointing dish was the hummus.  I like my hummus smoother and this one was a bit dry (which it had to be to hold the shape it was in I assume) and almost grainy.  Taste was only okay.  If I'm ever in Boston again, I will definitely hit this place up again and skip getting another lobster roll.> I had been meaning to try Oleana for a birthday or anniversary celebration for a couple of years but never planned ahead enough to get a reservation. You really need to plan four weeks in advance if you want a weekend reservation, maybe not quite as far out during the week. Recently, we finally actually visited Oleana for dinner while my in laws were visiting. We were a group of five and shared a number of small plates and a few desserts. We were very pleased with our experience at Oleana. There are a number of nice restaurants in the Cambridge area for a fancy dinner, but Oleana with its Mediterranean-inspired fine dining is definitely unique and a great option for something a bit different. When we arrived, the free parking for Oleana customers was the first thing we appreciated. When we went inside, our table is ready and we were seated right away. The dining area was cozy and pleasant, and the staff were very helpful in terms of recommending what and how much to order. With five people, we were able to try a lot of the small plates on the menu, and everything was delicious. We would definitely recommend this place for a nice night out. They also have a vegetarian dinner option with a chef's choice assortment of small plates, although we chose to just select our own from the menu.> I'm so happy I finally was able to come here!  Oleana is the real deal.  I loved it!  Our table wasn't ready when we arrived at the restaurant, however, we went to the bar and sipped on some wine to pass the time.  The restaurant is very warm and homey with Mediterranean inspired decoration.   it appeared the restaurant guests were locals in the area.  Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions of her favorite menu items I came for a date night and suggest ordering small plates for your meal .  We were pretty hungry so we ordered 5 plates, not including dessert (the more the merrier right?!).  We ordered strictly off of the hot meze section of the menu and got the honey nut squash,spinach falafel, fateh, mini butternut dolma, and lamejun.  For dessert we had the chocolate marquise!  Here is a breakdown of our favorite items.Lamejun- my favorite dish of the night! This was like a mini Mediterranean pizza of goodness! The lamb and sauce on top paired perfectly together! Mini butternut dolma- WOW! The lamb in this dish was amazing.  It was so tender and was easy enough to cut with a fork.  The goat cheese on top hit the spot!Chocolate marquise- who would've thought pear sorbet paired well with chocolate? Not me but it was delicious!  The spiced pecan katif offered a nice crunch!","5, 5, 3, 5, 4"

Additionally, the quantity was slightly lacking as I was still hungry after eating the entire meal. Really not too much else to say, given I don't enjoy the cuisine too much but one of the better Restaurants in Boston I've tried. Disappointed with no fortune cookie or tiny cracker sticks.

Both items were hefty in size and full of flavor. The steak was very tender and shrimps were very juicy. The shrimp fajita was almost impossible to eat though because the juices kept spilling out with each bite. I was forced to use a fork to eat my wrap. But with 2 added drinks, I spent about $28.

The furniture surrounding the place seem straight out of Williams Sonoma. The menu is split into three sections - really small plates, small plates, and pasta. For two, I recommend getting a risotto that is a big enough entree for two people, along with two small plates. We had the risotto, salmon, broccoli, and sorbet for dessert and each were on the mark!The place is popular but big enough where you can usually get a last-minute reservation and it's a great way to spend a couple hours.> Made a reservations for 2 at 5:15 pm. It took about 10 minutes to find street parking. We decided to try the arsenale tasting menu. We got:Cicchetti-Salted cod black bread -Olive fritte-Polpette meatballs  -Octopus  Piatti -Lolla rosa salad-Smoked sea trout-RibeyePasta-Rigatoni with oxtail, carrot, broccolini, pecorino-Pasta with snails and mint Dessert-Brownie with kumquat and espresso gelato The cicchetti were all brought out within 3 minutes, which made us feel rushed. However, the rest of the dishes were timed well. The piatti were my favorite, but everything was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and worked well with each other. When we ordered, the server asked for any allergies or aversions. I looked over the dinner menu and informed her I didn't like beets and they made sure no dishes had beets. However, the snail pasta that they served was not listed on the menu. I didn't enjoy the snail texture or taste. I hope in the future they inform you of the dishes on the tasting menu or provide a list of main ingredients they plan on using for the dishes, especially if something is not on the main menu.Overall great experience and I would definitely visit again!> One of the best South End restaurants (please at me on this), SRV's bar menu (Venetian small plates) definitely rivals the dinner options. Light yet packed with flavor, SRV is where we go for dinner, drinks and apps, and late night drinks. The wonderful folks behind the bar are always so friendly and knowledgable, it feels like a privilege for this to be our neighborhood spot (shoutout to John!)Be sure to get one of Chef Meg's desserts, she's always serving up the most surprising combinations (often times mixing in vegetables with sweeter flavors) -- trust me it works!> This restaurant has been on my bucket list for quite some time and I am so happy that we finally got to check it out. Hence, it was only for an after dinner drink, but it was still amazing. Because of the Pandemic with the COVID-19, the South End was a ghost town and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. Plus, it was pretty late too. We ordered an espresso martini for my husband and I had an after dinner drink with Mezcal (can't remember the name). I liked the espresso martini much better, but the ambience set the tone for a romantic evening and a great way to end the night! I can't wait to come back here for a full dinner experience, maybe for my bday in May. Fun fact: SRV stands for Serene Republic of Venice :) Your welcome...lol!> It's white truffle season and the risotto with truffles are dahvine.  A good wine caps the meal.   You can also opt for shavings of truffle to your pasta.  Dude, but you're dining in SRV,  live like a Venetian or Northern Italian and get the risotto with truffles!!    There is an upcharge for the truffle enhancement but well worth the deliciousness if you're a fan of white truffle.     As in visits ago, plates are very Venetian -- simple and fresh, undeniably typical of the area yet modernized.   The chef/owners here know what they are doing.   Paired with good wine and the dining experience at SRV turns out to be refined and enjoyable yet not as expensive as Venice.  I lived in Venice for 3 summers and this place brings me back.Service was a bit disjointed this time with empty plates left on our table for a loooooong time.  I hope it gets better.  Meno una stella .","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

Everyone is friendly and makes sure you get exactly what you want on your bowl. They are also happy to give recommendations if you're unsure on what to get.

For the $11 I spent on this sad little bowl, I could've gotten a fat burrito WITH guac down the street and still have change leftover.As a fast food chain (though they market themselves as health food, lol) you either have good ingredients or good portions, and CAVA is a strong 'meh' on both.

Dunno about that.> I'm sorry Chipotle, but we need to see other people. I have CAVA in my life now.This place blew the doors off my expectations. I literally just searched Yelp for Mediterranean food and picked this place just because it was close by. The atmosphere is very modern and trendy but casual, too. It's set up like a chipotle where you build your own bowl at the counter and have the choice of sitting down and eating your creation or taking it to go. There's more seating than you think because they have a whole separate extra seating room, as well as outdoor seating. I was here at 12:30 and there were still a lot of tables available inside and 4 outside on the patio. The food is out of this world. I got a bowl with saffron rice, chicken, lemon herb tahini, and a buuuunch of other yummy ingredients. I loved how many choices there were. At first I thought the price was too high until I saw the portion size (look at my pic attached to this review). It would be very difficult/impressive to finish this in one sitting.The only thing I don't like about this place is that there's not one where I live. Can't wait till I can come here again!> This was a really fast and healthy option, you can build your own bowl which was what I went with; superfood greens as much base, basmati trice for the grain, Tziki sauce, hummus, and eggplant sauce, then their roasted vegetables are really good plus their falafels are nice as well!

We found this place on Yelp and went in for a weekend lunch. It's a small spot but has nice design.Most importantly, the food was excellent. We've been to Thai restaurants all over the country, and this has to be one of the best we've tried. The basil fried rice, the drunken noodles, and the garlic stir fry dishes were all amazing. The only item I didn't love was the Galangal soup.If you're nearby at Quincy Market, this is definitely a place worth checking out.> Hands down BEST Thai in Boston. Cheap meals between 9-14 dollars for all entrees. Myanmar flair for the pork and shrimp noodle dish. Home made ice cream options. Spicy levels that are actually spicy.  These are real Thai people serving real Thai food. I love pad anything but many Thai places make it too greasy or the noodles are not a good texture. Not here. You can tell the ingredients are high quality despite the low prices and the small size of the joint. I believe it's new. Come eat here before they raise their prices.> We wanted to avail of the new Door Dash credit that comes with Chase Sapphire and a friend recommended we order-in Kala Thai. Our friends ordered the standard noodle dishes and found it quite decent, but the 4 of us who ordered the curries found them outstanding so I was happy with my choice. I'm one of those weirdos who loves pineapples in other foods (Hawaiian pizzas anyone??) and the pineapple curry was just the right amount of spice for me. I found it interesting how the brown rice was cheaper than jasmine white rice which costs at extra 50 cents. Perhaps they are just trying to encourage healthy eating? It seemed to work if that was the case as we all stuck the whole grain brown option.> Short summary of Kala Thai Cookery: Food was great. Prices were great. Service was not so great. I ordered the Spicy Noodle Soup with shrimp and egg noodles. I received Spicy Noodle Soup with shrimp and rice noodles. I didn't complain however due to the fact that I also like rice noodles. So I went about my business chatting during dinner time and slurping my noodles. My noodle soup was served beautifully: in a deep dish noodle bowl and garnished with scallions and chopped peanuts. I was given chop sticks and a noodle spoon without me asking which was nice! The ambiance is lively here. The decor is quite trendy! There is plenty of seating although tightly packed together. There seems to always be a line for take out. I'm not surprised at all because the food is very good and the prices are very affordable. The only other snafoo I experienced at dinner time was that my card was charged for the wrong bill. Once we alerted the waiter, it took some time but he remedied the situation. All in all, I would certainly return back here. The food and prices are too good!> GPS gave us a hard time with this place. It was worth the walk in the cold.I ordered the Kee Mao and it was very tasty! Just the right balance of heat and sweet. My friend ordered the pineapple curry and while I didn't taste it, she loved it.We arrived at 5:30PM and it was pretty empty inside but the crowd really picked up around 6. Service is timely and super helpful. When I couldn't decide between the Pad Thai and Kee Mao the waitress suggested the more popular one. Truly worth it.Would recommend!","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

Sadly the Dine Out Boston menu was a big disappointment...The meal started with some tasty bread that came with roasted garlic in olive oil. The bread was awesome-- super soft on the inside with a chewy crust. This made me very hopeful for the rest of the meal, but unfortunately I think the bread was the highlight for me.For the appetizers we tried both the chicories and herb salad and the shrimp & grits. The salad tasted very refreshing because it had fruits (apples and pomegranate) in addition to a bright, tangy vinaigrette. But it wasn't terribly special and I feel like I could get a similar tasting salad at a typical cafe. The shrimp & grits was nicely seasoned. The grits were shaped into a cake and seared, which formed a crispy base. But again, it tasted like something I could easily make at home.The entrees were pretty disappointing. The braise pork osso bucco was extremely dry and came with a heaping serving of equally dry beans. The seared black bass was tender, but pretty bland and came with another excessively large serving of cabbage. The protein-to-vegetable ratio on the two entrees seemed off balance. I probably wouldn't complain so much if the vegetables tasted better, but unfortunately they weren't anything special.We both got the blueberry miso crumb cake for dessert. The serving was pretty big-- each plate came with 3 small slices of cake. The cake wasn't too sweet and paired well with the blueberry compote and creme fraiche.Food-wise, I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by my visit. However the servers were very attentive and friendly. If their regular menu items are anything like the Dine Out Boston menu items, then I definitely won't be coming back.> Honestly I would give Metropolis a 1 Star had it not been for the good customer service.My coworker had heard this was a tasty restaurant, so I came in on a Saturday for brunch with high hopes and an empty stomach! I ordered what seems to be quite popular here, the huevos rancheros. As you can see by my picture, the item that came out was really disappointing. There was what looks to be a slice of Krafts single cheese slabbed onto my brunch order.... they couldn't even melt it for me?! Looking back at Yelp pictures, it seems as if the cheese is normally grated and placed on the order, which begs the question of WHAT HAPPENED?? How lazy can you be?!Aside from the cheese slice, the tortilla strips on the top were stale and the meat in the huevos rancheros was hard :( Honestly, everything with the order was just unimpressive. My friends ordered the pastrami hash and they said that item wasn't good either. There were wayyy too many strike outs during my visit for me to return. Unfortunately, Metropolis was a no for me.> Great date spot. My wife and I live around the corner from this place and finally made it over. We were very satisfied. I had the duck breast and my wife had the rigatoni.  Both were amazing. The duck was basically perfectly cooked and flavor was awesome. The sauce of the rigatoni was also very good. The service was great and we'd definitely go back with some friends. The place is tiny and reservations were tough. We went really early on a Saturday afternoon and we were okay.> Over ten years later and Metropolis is still a stand out. The menu is largely unchanged - chicken, veal (well, really the cauliflower gratin side) and rigatoni all phenomenal. Salads are all really solid and the Brussels sprouts dish is a sleeper on the app menu. Simple cocktails and solid wine list. And best of all, it's cozy as all heck. Though I no longer live in SoEnd, it's places like Metropolis that make me miss it desperately. Ask any local to the 'hood and it'll be on their top 5 list, trust me","5, 3, 2, 4, 5"

We needed some comfort food and boy did we get it.I got the burger special, which included some sort of creamy spread on the bun. It was perfection for after three hours of beer sampling. Fries were fine.The bar itself is not too big. we grabbed a spot near the front at a table and pretty much kept to ourselves. We quickly got our food and pints from the bartender, although most of us barely finished the pints. Nothing was wrong with them, we just couldn't stomach any more beer! Then we all ate in silence as we devoured our food.Thanks for the wind-down to our night!> my first time in Boston and after that 4hours++ bus ride from NYC my sister was starving. this place happens to be located just across our hotel and my sister was craving fries hence we just went it. everything about this place turned out so much better than expected! great ambience! casual, chill, and relaxed. amazing and very pleasant service too! the guy was really amiable and he was attentiveI ordered Portobello Sammy, my sister got the Fourth Wall Grilled Cheese Sandwich and we shared the Lobster and Corn Chowder..- the Lobster Chowder was amazing! it has the most generous pieces of lobster I've ever had in a chowder and the crouton was actually corn bread, which blends really well- both sandwiches came with massive amount of fries. I switched mine to sweet potato fries. Fluffy brioche bun, sharp savory cheese, the portobello has strong acidic taste to it.. Overall it was really good. the sweet potato fries has amazing texture but both fries were kind of bland for unknown reason. there were so much fries we had to pack the leftovers to go. they'll make a good bus ride snack I suppose.for the quality of the food, the size, service, and atmosphere I think they charge decently and was well worth it.. it was overall a very enjoyable lunch> Tried this place out on a weeknight before heading to a show at the Wang Theater. It's a weird mix between a lively bar and restaurant but I appreciate the effort at a nice full menu in a place like this. I had a couple gin and tonics which were quite good and strong. Their menu is limited but has some really nice dinner options. I chose the hanger steak cooked medium. It arrived quickly but was overdone and chewy. The side of street corn was just okay. My partner's meal was also mediocre (burger). Our waiter was exceptionally nice. He was trying his best but it became too busy for him to keep up with tables. It took a while for the second round of drinks. After the meal he initially brought back a bill which was not ours. We waited patiently for him to return the correct bill which charged us for an extra we never had. We sucked it up, paid and got out of there. Overall great people with great intentions. It's just not working yet.> Very good. Went here for lunch today. We got there at the perfect time because it really filled up. I had the burger and a salad. No complaints but the burger could have been cooked a little longer for medium. If you're really picky about your red meat I would have them cook it longer than usual. The sweet potato fries were also a hit! The service was very friendly and the food came out relatively fast. I would definitely stop in here for lunch!> We were looking for a casual spot to get burgers and beers and this spot was perfect. You can expect all the classics of a bar menu. Wound up getting the burger with fries. It is served on a buttered brioche bun - yum! The place is on the smaller side and tends to get packed pretty quickly with the after work crowd on weekdays.","4, 4, 3, 4, 4"

The original Regina's on Thatcher Street has been around since before the Great Depression which speaks volumes to its longevity. It should be your first choice for pizza as well - the romano in the sauce, old-time oven, and homemade sausage all contribute to an amazing combination. To treat ourselves during quarantine, we ordered a Fior Di Latte and Melanzane pizza that was easily accessible through Grubhub delivery. Even with some of the cheese dripping from the Fior pizza, both these pizzas hit the spot. We may do this as a bi-weekly order while we stay in and flatten the curve. Hope you're all staying safe!> I'm usually very generous with my reviews, but I have to be strict when it comes to Pizza. My experience there was 5 Stars, but the Pizza was only 4 stars. The pizza is very full and flavorful, which is a lot of fun. However, they weren't the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust was overcooked and the toppings seemed strewn about on the pizza somewhat carelessly. All that being said, it was very good pizza! And the staff was very friendly and helpful.I was very excited about the #15 (called Saint Augustine, maybe?), a white sauce pizza with sausage and onions. I was very disappointed with the pizza. Looked amazing, tasted less amazing.We also got the Giambotta (#12?) and it was great! Lots of green onions, good classic ""combo pizza"" feel, but original taste.All in all, I'd make sure to consult with the staff about what pizzas to get and they'll steer you in a better direction than we went! Great spot.> In Boston for business and will be here for some time. Finding good places to eat is essential. Pizza was my craving and Yelp searching began.I love tradition and Regina's fit the bill. The ambience of this place is exactly what I love. Nothing fancy. Just great service and food.I had the 10 inch #14 Classico. The dough is outstanding. Lite sauce and great toppings. It was heavy on the artichokes and next time I will try a different pizza.There are many choices and I didn't count all of the them.  Something for everyone. The 10 inch could easily serve 2 people. You can't go wrong at Regina's. I notices a lot of folks ordering simple pizzas with 1 or 2 toppings. The sauce and crust is soooo good, I understand why.If your looking for pizza, stop in at Regina's, you will thank me.> The slice was huge! My personal favorite feature is the thick outer crust. The dough in the center was kept quite thin which made the pizza nearly impossible to pick up without dropping the toppings. I ended up grabbing a fork and knife just to eat it.Despite the mess, it was very delicious. I got a vegetarian pizza loaded with tomato, spinach, and their specialty mozzarella.Paid $7 even for a huge slice of pizza and 20ml Dr. Pepper. I would definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza.> I didn't buy fully into the hype here, but I did really enjoy the pizza. What I found most surprising about the pizza was how unique it was, particularly given the ubiquity of all the sister locations. And its true, the pizza here tastes completely different, mostly due to the oven and the freshness of the ingredients.First of all, the crust is extremely crisp and that extends throughout the entire pie. This is in no way a thin crust pizza - it's thick, charred, and dry with absolutely no flop, but missing a bit of flavor in the dough as a tradeoff. The mozzarella they used was clearly very fresh, but there wasn't much of an aged flavor. Finally, I wasn't personally too keen on the sauce, which was mild in flavor (by design) and has a little kick. With all that combined, the pizza tasted pretty mild overall, but the quality of the ingredients did have a chance to shine. The pizza was closer to a dressed-up casual pie, than a true gourmet outing. I'm not sure it's my favorite in the city (that probably goes to Posto, although the style is very different) and I definitely wouldn't want to wait very long for it, but it was a good pie nonetheless.","5, 4, 5, 4, 4"

The short rib poutine is a must, as are the french toast and burgers. One time I had the fruity pebble pancakes which looks amazing but were a total miss, the cereal glaze or whatever it's called was bland and too thick. Besides that though, everything I've ordered has been great.The vibe is alive and buzzy. Mostly the young professional crowd which is the norm for Southie. Wait times on the weekend can be long, put your name on the list in advance if you can't get a reservation.> I was so excited to try this place out! I had an hour to kill before heading somewhere else in South Boston, so I did some research and decided to meet a friend at Lincoln Tavern. The reviews were so good! And I've already been to Capo a few times, so I wanted to try something new. What a disappointment!My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I got an espresso martini which came out with some kind of powder on top - a lot of it. Have you ever heard of the cinnamon challenge? Not good. I then ordered the margherita pizza and was saddened by the lack of flavor. I mean look at the pic... that's exactly what it tasted like. Bland AF. They didn't even offer chili flakes or parmesan to spice it up. I could have asked, but that leads me to my 2nd gripe...The bartenders seemed nice, but were absent. We got our order in right away, but then I had to ask twice for water. Then, our food came and no one stopped by to ask how the food was or if we needed anything else (like something to give the pizza flavor...). We were done eating when they thought to come by and see if we wanted another drink. No thanks.It was a Wednesday night at 6 PM and the restaurant was full, but not crowded (which it sounds like this place can get later at night and on weekends). Not sure what happened here because the same group owns Capo down the block and they have good food (come to think of it - their pizza was underwhelming too - my bad) and great drinks. How can Capo's espresso martini be wonderful and Lincoln's be so dreadful? Same owners - same block! I don't know. I'd like to give this place another chance. My friend did like his tacos and the brunch reviews are good. If I come back and have a better experience, I'll update my review. Until then ""Meh. I've experienced better"" sounds like the right rating to me.> I want to like Lincoln.The food has been consistently good, to be honest it's one of the best burgers I have had the pleasure of eating. Yet, the good food cannot undo the fact that every time I'm there I am transported to a college frat party. I've gone three times, all at different times of day, and without fail the place is jam packed with people loudly sloshing beer, yelling at the football games, and generally being inconsiderate of other patrons. The most recent time there was no different, except for the fact that the food was mediocre at best while the first two times it was excellent. I had the shortribs on top of a very salty truffle mac n cheese (could not finish it, far too rich) while my fiancee ate a burger that looked almost raw (she ordered it medium). Maybe try going at an off time, lunch on a weekday perhaps. If you want to brave a weekend then if sticky floors and screaming over your food is your thing, by all means go. We'll opt for something else next time.I really do want to like Lincoln, the food is usually great but the atmosphere is so unbearable that it ruins the meal.> Lincoln Tavern was one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to + it was a perfect spot for football Sunday! The food is above average and the bar has a nice vibe - there are TVs everywhere for you to watch the games. Our group loved it!We started with spicy wings and a plain pizza - both were fabulous. Our table got the steak burrito and burgers for entrees - also delicious. They give you huge portions on all the food so be sure to come here hungry!The service was good despite it being extremely packed for the football games. I definitely recommend making a reservation as we did have to wait a half hour for a table. Regardless, it wasn't an issue as the bar was a blast!Next time I'm back in Boston, I certainly will be heading here again! Highly recommend.> Lincoln continues to deliver my favorite brunch! Their hash browns call to me every weekend. It's always crowded so get there early. Get at least one of these when you go:- hash browns- spicy Bloody Mary- wheat toast- fruit bowl. It has a large variety and I don't know where they get their fruit buts it's always fresh, ripe and juicyOne thing I wish they had was fresh cream for the coffee. I appreciate the warm breakfast appetizer berry bread, so yummy!","5, 2, 2, 5, 5"

Cocktails have room for improvement but Il Molo makes up for it with an extensive fantastic wine list.  Is definitely a hidden gem right off the main track of the north end.  A must dine!> I took a group of 13 to IL Molo. We shared 12 dishes and asked to have them served 4 at a time. The first 4 came out barely warm. After complaining the next 8 were nice and hot.The bread we were originally served tasted like it had been sliced long ago as the exposed surfaces were stale. After complaining, we received delicious fresh bread for the rest of the mesl3 of our dishes contained lobster but all I found were the claw tips. When asked, they admitted 2 only had the tips but said that the lobster pie had tail meat but I couldn't find any.The scallops were delicious as well as the spaghetti and clams and lobster pie. The seafood stew was plentiful and tasty except for the tough lobster claw tips. When I have lobster at home, the tips go to my dog. It seems that more and more restaurants only serve claws which leads me to believe they are not cooking whole lobsters but just buying pre-cooked claws which are most likely far less expensive than tails. (This is my hypothesis and not a verified fact for Il Molo.) The service was good and our party overall liked our meals.> The service and food was fantastic. Our server had great recommendations for wine that both my husband and I loved. The mussels were beautiful done with a great broth that made us ask for a second round of bread to sop it up. We then split an order of linguini and clams that was perfectly seasoned with al dente pasta. I would return here in a second!> Such a good italian/seafood destination! Came for dinner to meet up with some friends in the area and was surprised I had never heard of it while living in Boston for 6 years for school. It's a little separated from the rest of the North End and has a slightly more modern and sea-themed feel/decor. Don't let the seashells and starfish fool you though, you still get amazing quality pasta and italian flavors!Prix fixe menu: $32 for 3 courses, and you get a lot of food! I took home leftovers. I had the grilled lamb skewers, the lasagna, and the rum cake (as they were sadly all out of the gelato and the cannoli that night). The lamb was cooked really well, the lasagna was super flavorful and cheesy, and the cake was moist and delicious! Oysters: not pictured, but we went for a selection of 3 total, one of each variety they had that day. They came with lemon, tabasco, and two sauces-one of them was raspberry flavored which was kind of fun!Swordfish: really really good! The cook on the fish was perfect and it had a good crispiness on the outside. Definitely worth it and the quality you would expect with the Boston Harbor basically right outside.> Awesome experience here. Lovely fruity olive oil with crusty bread to start, tasty lobster rangoon with nice chunks of lobster in it, and beautiful main dishes. The only negative was the bar tender- who was not nice. The waitress and hostess were over the top helpful and attentive though. I got the pasta arrabbiata with mussels and octopus, and my friend got a fish dish which had salsa and lobster in top. They make the pasta there and the seafood is extremely fresh.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

Nice place - clean. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with a side of fresh fries. The fries were very fresh and crunchy just the way I like them. The guy who made my wrap did not skimp out on the chicken at all! It was a very fulfilling wrap. It was just a tad bit more dry than I expected even with the extra garlic sauce. Overall, this place is great for a quick bite to eat.> Stay away from the beef.I went here for lunch with some coworkers during peak lunch time. One ordered a falafel wrap and said it was good and moist. One ordered chicken shawarma wrap and like it. The other ordered chicken shawarma plate and loved it.I ordered beef shawarma plate (9.80) and it was absolutely gross except the well seasoned Greek salad.The beef was the ***driest**** beef I've ever had. It was also cold in some areas. Not a single bite of the hot dish was hot. I left 90% of the beef on my plate, since it was actually unpalatable.The fries had zero seasoning. I had to put my own salt on them. Underwhelming.This is disappointing because we went during peak lunch hours. Food should be top quality during this time.The only good thing was the side of Greek salad. I loved it! The staff doesn't call your number on the receipt so it is challenging to get the right plate. I would not go here again, and I would not recommend it.> I'll notch it up a star because Bishop's has decent spinach pie as a side. A couple of them, along with a salad, makes an okay meal.> Delicious food ! Their chicken shawarma is amazing and also their grape leaves are the best !> Nice and clean restaurant for lunch today, they have tables inside and out. I chose the chicken shawarma platter for lunch and it was very good. A couple of small bones in with the chicken but that's to be expected for freshly pulled chicken. It was quite tasty.A good portion of chicken, garlic sauce, hummus and tabouli with a pita on the side. The pickled radishes on the side were a nice bite.

We were seated immediately with a reservation and enjoyed the meatballs and bread to start with a lovely bottle of Italian red. The meatballs were amazing! We both agreed the sauce was our favorite thing we ate all weekend! For our entrees I had a pizza and my fiancé got Bolognese. The pizza was pretty good, but I would definitely recommend getting the pasta! The texture was perfect. We shared dessert to end the meal and left full and satisfied. I would highly recommend this if you're wanting to try some Italian food in Boston but don't want to have to stand in line or travel to north end. It was so cozy and exactly what I was looking for!> I want to give 2 stars. Except the food is actually quite good.

So why only 3 stars WANTING to be 2 stars?? Their vibe/atmosphere is HEINOUS. Good God. Horrible. Everyone is packed in like sardines. It's a weird/odd/old spot, but whoever came up with this particular ""layout"" probably needs to be slapped. I got elbowed, hard, in the boob, just trying to get to the sad/undersized/un-dusted bathroom because it required I walk behind the bar seating. Whoever is choosing the music?? NEEDS TO BE FIRED. TODAY. Absolutely horrible. Loud, grating, screeching, you have to YELL at your dining companion. Who is 6"" away. Because there is, legit, no actual room in this place. And the thing that REALLY REALLY REALLY turned me entirely off: they are using the absolute cheapest, rock bottom, bad silverware. How do I know?? I own a damn restaurant. In fact, it's a diner. And I would NEVER use such pathetic dining utensils. I'm not paying almost $100 per person to eat with horrible cheap diningware. Which includes the ""side plates"" provided if you are sharing dishes. They're big enough for like one slice of bread...Delicious food. Horribly uncomfortable and awkward dining experience. Horrendous/terrible vibe. Seems to work for them. Place was quite busy. I won't be back.> I went here for my birthday dinner and had an amazing time. The intimate setting was perfect for a date night and transported me into a restaurant like in Italy. We got the charcuterie board which was to die for. The meats were so fresh. We got a specialty pizza that was amazing - cooked from the brick oven. The meatballs were the favorite appetizer of the night. The sauce I meatballs came in  I wish could have taken home just in a jar to cook with. The sauce had a bit of a kick to it which we really enjoyed. Overall great ambiance, wait staff was friendly and delicious food!> Coppa offered one of the best culinary experiences we've had in a long time via their Christmas Eve Feast of the 7 Fishes event.It's a fixed price tasting menu that plays on the Italian tradition and offers paired wines (4 oz) at a super reasonable price. The creativity and execution of this meal/event was flawless and took notes from many different cuisines outside of the standard Italian staples such as Japanese, New England American, and French which added to the overall experience and variety. The wine pairings were as creative as the meal itself and offered varietals and types of wine not typically seen on menus which not only worked very well with the food but also to expand our palette and knowledge of offerings from different regions. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly throughout the whole experience which was what I would expect from an event like this. However, the way the multiple servers rotated throughout the evening was like a well-choreographed dance that had no faults.We were so impressed with the experience we not only decided that 5 stars was appropriate but we made immediate plans to come back and try the standard menu in the next two weeks.> Nice little spot on Shawmut. I took my folks for an easy Sunday night dinner. These are pricey small plates but really solid, quality food. My parents got the celery Caesar with was a bunch of fresh celery and not a salad they expected but they enjoyed. I had the tagliatelle which was amazing. I got one order to go for my wife as well. Looks like a good spot for a nice date night as well.","5, 3, 5, 5, 4"

However, I thought the portion of the sides (such as fries and especially the salad) were on the smaller side but considering the affordable price for where Coda is located, I'm not mad at it. The servers were also very friendly, so overall I had a pretty good experience!> Chill and staple restaurant in the South End. Came for their cocktail menu, which seems to have a few new selections periodically (their menu on the website might not be up to date). The cocktails are pretty strong and interesting.The veggie burger was pretty standard and highly stacked, which made it a little hard to eat. The patty was pretty good though. The fries were pretty flavorful and a good surprise.> A simple and comfortable spot in South End. My group of five did not have to wait at all to be seated on a Saturday. The server was very helpful in giving recommendations. Food wise, the deviled eggs were divine: buttery, creamy, and with the right amount of spice. However, the French toast fries did not live up to expectations, because the dipping sauce was entirely melted butter... it would've been much better with cinnamon sugar or maple syrup. The veggie burger was good too! I liked the beets spread in my burger.> Solid food, efficient service, but felt slightly overpriced for the food. I ordered the Mac n cheese as an add on size and that was the best decision of my week. Creamiest homemade Mac n cheese ever. My only regret was not including the bacon renderings in it. Wish I could conjure up that cheesy sauce out of thin air-I was using my hamburger bun to mop up that cheesy sauce, the ""classy"" version of licking your plate. Lamb meatballs was AMAZING. Juicy, not over cooked, not gamey, and delicious. It's hard to make lamb meatballs while making sure it's juicyKey lime pie was delicious and refreshing. Glad to see that they didn't add any green food coloring to the pie. the bright green key lime pies are artificially colored.> Walking back from the Pride Block party, we pass Coda...the people inside seem to be enjoying themselves, so we stop to look at the menu.  Located over a family enjoying their meal, they share that the drinks and the food are great.  Even their little girl seemed happy about Coda.A staff member came outside and shared a menu with us to read and immediately we were hooked.  The staff was great and on top of it with the service.  Answering our food questions and making suggestions.  I like that.The space is great and works for a group of two to maybe 10 with reservations.  But they have table top, high top and bar seating, so you can go wrong.The food was incredible.  We did not diversify with our choices and both had the chicken, which was really, really good!  The combination of the chicken with polenta and kale which the sauce, well...it was the best.  I could have licked the plate...but I have class and did not.The full bar options provided us with choices...and the rum drink (forgot the name) was yummy.What a perfect way to end the most awesome day in Boston.  A relaxing space with great people and incredible food.  Thank you.","4, 3, 4, 4, 5"

Everything was fantastic. The oysters were fresh and the mussels were tender. The lobster roll was full of flavor and definitely in the top three best lobster rolls I've had in Boston so far. Fries are a weakness of mine and I loved the fries at Black Lamb. They were just the right thickness. But by far the best dish of the night was the lamb tartare with eggplant, fig, and mint. Wow. It might have been the most interesting tartare I've ever had. I was super curious about the combo of ingredients (all so seemingly different from each other) in the tartare when I first saw it on the menu and I'm so happy I tried it. It was so good and so fresh, and I loved how each ingredient complemented each other. Taste | 5Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4.5> NEVER AGAIN!! Oysters were great and the deal during lunch was super, but they are ""Oysters""...Nature and G*d made them...Nicoise Salad...if it isn't a ""Nicoise Salad"" why call it that?  Call it a ""Salmon Salad.""  Very disappointing.   But the TOPPER was this....""A 3% Kitchen Team Administration Feewill be added to your bill.

WTF???  What is an ""ADMINISTRATION"" FEE, and why should your clientele care about your ""sustainable schedule""??   If you cannot pay your employees a fair wage and give them health benefits then perhaps you should have thought twice about even opening a restaurant. Is this to guarantee that I receive clean silverware when I dine with you??  Totally RIDICULOUS...maybe this works in some far left pit like San Francisco but it won't FLY in Boston, and as a matter of fact San Francisco had 400 restaurant closures in 2019.  A word of warning to the wise should be sufficient.  Figure your wages into your food cost or go back to the drawing board.  Not everyone just fell off the turnip wagon like most of the Brung-In Posers in the South End.  Bostonians [real ones] Beware!!! sfgate.com/food/article/…> Really outstanding experience here. The atmosphere is nice-but-not-formal (there's a TV behind the bar), with friendly and prompt service, but the culinary experience blows many more buttoned-up restaurants out of the water. Note that they're no longer serving the lamb tartare I saw mentioned online, which was disappointing, but the Wagyu tartare that replaces it is truly excellent. I love having a raw bar with a decent selection of oysters to open up the meal. The duck breast frites were also fantastic - tender, juicy and flavorful.> I love (like, LOVE) Bar Mezzana, so is it any surprise that I love their sister restaurant as well? My friend and I have been indulging lately in little friendship ""date nights"" where we try new places, grab some bites, and DEFINITELY partake in some cocktails.For once in my life, I didn't get a martini. Well, not my traditional Hendrick's martini, at least. I ventured out of my comfort zone for the espresso martini because, hey, they are trendy as hell right now, and I don't always have to fight the crowd. It was absolutely delicious... maybe even too delicious - I had several. We made a reservation, which I recommend. This place gets busy. We had a little two-seater that was dangerously close to our neighbors, but which was surprisingly quiet. I started with some oysters, as always, and finished with the mussels. The mussels were fantastic and came with fresh grilled bread (I only wish I had a little more bread for that broth!). We were enjoying it so much, that after dinner we relocated to the bar for a nightcap (or three) and dessert. We fell in love with the special pie, which was TOFFEE (YASSSSS), and with the corn madeleines. They are baked to order, which worked out because it gave us plenty of time to digest.Our service from start to finish was fantastic. Our server was attentive, plates and glasses were bussed quickly, and the one time I was looking around admiring the decor, the manager immediately came up to make sure I didn't need anything. Once we moved to the bar, we were helped immediately, despite how busy it was. 10/10 on service, guys.Another hit from Chef Colin Lynch, Heather Kennaway Lynch, Jefferson Macklin, Ben Kaplan, and Beverage Director Ryan Lotz. I worship anything you do.> I came here with my sister and cousin for girls night. I was looking forward to it because my cousin had raved about it. The problem was, however, that I'm a sea foodie and not a land foodie. I couldn't not find a pescatarian dish to save my life besides the raw oysters that I enjoyed. My sister attempted to order the lobster roll but they were all out. I attempted to order the branzino and they were all out. There was nothing that interested me and I had worked up an appetite for this place. I was so disappointed. The waitress told me they had one salmon left that they could make with the branzino fixings so my sister settled for the duck and I had the salmon. The salmon was just ok. The only thing I enjoyed here overall was the oysters and the soup I ordered.","5, 1, 5, 5, 2"

We got the kimchi fried rice, the shojonator and a grilled chicken in the Bao from the lunch menu. The shojonator never disappoints.Have to come back for their dinner menu!> DINNER REVIEWCame here after an event in their event space upstairs. We had some of the apps and loved them so much that we wanted the full experience. We had to wait 30 minutes or so on a Thursday night but they had pretty fast turnover.This place is dimly-lit and loud but smells amazing from all the food you're surrounded by. If the idea of Asian Fusion Bar Food sounds good to you (like it does to me), then this is the place for you. I think I could have ordered every single thing on the menu but here is what we got:Wu-Tang Tiger Style Ribs - fall of the bone, sticky, sweet, and spicy. These are a must-getKimchi Fried Rice - can't go wrong with fried rice and kimchiKorean Steak Tartar - a delicious tartar with these chewy yet crunchy scallion pancakes to scoop them up withGrilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwich - a little difficult to share but it's stacked high with moist chicken thighs and covered in a fried peanut aioli. Reminds you exactly of kung pao chicken.The portions are much bigger than your average small plates restaurant so 2 each is more than enough. This place has great value for the quality and quantity of food you get.I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu.> Came here on a Saturday night past 10pm and it was pretty packed. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries and a cold brew Vodka tea. Both were decent and for a person who does not really drink, the cold Vodka tea was delicious. I just thought the service could have been better. It took way too long for things to come out, it was hard to track down our waiter and overall the restaurant gave a night scene kinda feel which is fine, but usually in those places, service is hard to get and noise is beyond loud.","4, 5, 5, 5, 3"

The space inside is pretty cramped and loud.The service was decent - it bothered us that as soon as we stopped eating, our waiter took everything away (even the hot sauce!) without asking if we were done. At that point we were still debating going for another round of tacos but we obviously overstayed our welcome.> Puro knocks it out on (or rather, a few steps below) Newbury for cool vibes and great eats. The blah: our party of two had to wait longer than we would've wanted on a Wednesday night... when we arrived at 7:30 PM, we were told it would be 15-20 min and ended up waiting about 45 until we were seated at the bar. But the server was super apologetic, which made it seem like this isn't an everyday occurence.The yum: cocktails! I got the tequila mule which was limey and spicy, with fresh slices of jalapeños in the glass. My friend enjoyed her passionfruit drink which came with a strawberry on the side.For dinner, we shared the ceviche mixto, the chicken tacos, and the corn pancakes. I would definitely order the ceviche and pancakes again! The chicken in the tacos was too greasy for my taste, and the flavors of the sauce and pineapple salsa didn't really come through. It was also kind of messy to eat, and the soft tortilla got soggy quickly. But the ceviche - oh my! Fish, octopus, and shrimp were served up in a delish sauce with avocado and plantain chips. It was a great portion for sharing too! And the corn pancakes - yummo! The two cakes are slightly sweet and have cheese in between them as well as a sauce and more cheese on top. They're deliciously different.The small space is dimly lit and has cool hip sweet street art-like paintings on the walls. Come with a small group, early if you can, or plan to wait. But it's worth it. And the menu is large, so there will always be more to try. Puro ceviche vida!> Such a unique and fun hidden gem on  Newbury street. It's a really small spot with dim lighting, fun music, no more then 7 tables. Tip: they don't take reservations so make sure to get there early The food was delicious too. They had many vegetarian options that were delicious. Our table split the guacamole, Mexican style corn, and peppers for apps. Then we all got tacos for our main meal. I got the portobello mushroom tacos and they were delicious. For drinks I had the tequila mule and it was the perfect amount of spicy. I would definitely recommend it. After the meal we had churros for dessert and they were so good.> Good food, good attitude and down from earth,  literally. If you're vegetarian or pescatarian you will die for this venue.  After good falafels and good Levantine lamb, fresh ceviche is my third favorite food. Puro knows how to make a good tuna ceviche very well. They know also how to grill a bronzino. And for sure they know how to make the perfect pisto manchego.  Pisto is the Spanish equivalent of ratatouille. And who doesn't love a good warm Pisto. It's a vegan delicious dish topped with quail eggs and queso manchego. They have few tables but every time we walk in here, we get seated right away. Waitresses are so pleasant. Get the Pisto. Get tuna ceviche. Get grilled fish. Next time would try paella. They have brunch over the weekends.","5, 5, 3, 4, 5"

They serve home style Italian food. Their portions are enormous. Everything can be shared among at least 2 people or even 3. They offer fresh pasta with variety of different sauces, from marinara to the pesto. At the same time they offer fish and meat dishes. I had their antipasto, Caesar salad and lasagne. Antipasto was refreshing with a light dressing. It's a combination of lettuce, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. Nice way to start a meal with a glass of wine and antipasto. The lasagna was tasty too. We paired everything with a nice bottle of wine. Their wine list is pretty big. Most selection is Italian and American. Their wine prices are very decent and wine matches the style of the food they serve. The restaurant itself has a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Lots of wood, quite music on the background, view of a wine cellar.  Good place to have a couple dinner or small gathering.> I've been to La Famiglia's several times before and I've always been happy with the food and especially the portion size, which is HUGE (think 3 meals worth). This time, I was really blown away - the food was better than I remembered. I think there is a disparity because I ordered the specials this time, as opposed to X pasta with X sauce. There were four of us and we split three entrees and one salad. We ended up taking leftovers.Al's Favorite - I definitely recommend. It came with chicken, broccoli, gnocchi, and vodka sauce. This was the favorite of the night.Tortellini with chicken and pesto sauce - Also a favorite of the night. The pesto was very creamy.Lasagna with bolognese - this was definitely good lasagna with creamy filling, but it was the least favorite, simply because the specials were excellent.Caprese salad - fresh and delicious with soft mozzarella.They also serve bread and dipping oil at the  start of the meal. Overall, they have delicious food and very reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. We went at 6pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 mins.> ""Help me! I think I've fallen in love again!""...With this Warm cozy spot found on Salem st... For a quick minute, I died and ended up in my Nana's kitchen ... Service was attentive right from the start. Made a reservation and showed up a little early and they sat us early. Water and bread hit the table less than a minute after we did. Waitstaff extremely intelligent and gracious, offering excellent suggestions at every instance. (This differs from some previous experiences  I've had in the north end). Wine offering was very good and the price points accessible. But the food ... the food is why we go... and it is the best I have had in the north end. (Period))And I've conservatively tried at least 30 restaurants over the years, and La Famiglia exceeds every experience I've had based on quality and quantity of their dishes and the speed and attentiveness of service. Easily 5 stars Buon Appetito!!> This was a great late lunch, I'm a lucky lady my partner invited me out for fruitti de mare, a full plate of your choice of pasta penne or linguini in either white sauce-olive oil, garlic, etc., or house red, or a fresh tomato.  I picked house red, terrific with penne.  The dish came with a generous amount of calamari, mussels, and little necks.  Did I mention they have a luncheon menu, but we really came for the great frutti de mare on the regular dinner menu a larger portion than luncheon menu.  My partner insisted we get the dinner size, not a problem.  The shellfish was very fresh, pasta cooked perfect.  The marinara was delicious.   The place was busy with many out for lunch.   It is cozy and I love the fireplace and the way this place is tucked into the building. The bread is fresh and warm with a bit of hot in the olive oil dipping sauce.  We could have gotten one plate and shared but my other likes eating big!We will be back, we bring our visitors here always a memorable dinner or lunch.> Great place to gather and be welcomed as if one of the family..!La Famiglia Giorgio, located down a narrow side street on the Northside, smack dab in little Italy.  Seriously, as we walked around with google leading the way we felt like we were transplanted to another time and place.   Love the location.  Very quaint.  Parking can be a little challenging. Recommended by our knowledgeable Bostonian friends, we knew we were in for a treat.  At 5pm we were quoted a wait of an hour for a party of eight.  When the last person of our group arrived and checked in with the host about 5 minutes later we were taken right in.  So nice to know a relation of the Godfather.  From a tiny bar downstairs with a few tables we were ushered upstairs which opened up to a rather roomy dining room full of life and noise.  Everyone talking, singing, having a great time!The service was quick, efficient, jovial.  The food was, well it was in MASSIVE proportions!   Our friend who recommended Giorgio's was most familiar with the huuge menu so we happily left the ordering to him.  Had a sampling of antipasti salad, chicken parmigiana, large meatballs, clams...what didn't we have?!!? Unfortunately three of us forgot to tell him we were doing low/no carbs so you can imagine the infinite amount of leftovers!  Lol.  All delicious.Thank you Larry and Judy, thank you Cindy and the Godfather's nephew for a most memorable evening!","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Menu contains a lot of smaller plates that are good for sharing and a few entree sized dishes. MUST TRY: Smoked mussel toast - creamy pumpkin, sage, garlic aioli on top of toasted sourdough - perfect combo of flavors and texture! I will go back just for this dish (maybe 2 orders of it!)Good:Ceviche - fresh fish with lime and chili on top of a crispy tortilla - light and refreshing. Paired well with my glass of rose.Mooncusser Chowder - a lighter bodied chowder filled with different varieties of seafood (reminded me of a delicious chowder I've had many years ago in Manhattan beach, CA).80 Thoreau Burger - simple but very satisfying... the patty was very tender and juicy and the Thoreau sauce (not exactly sure what's in it) was very flavorful.We also tried the deviled eggs and fish taco (portion is pretty big). They were fine, but nothing special - would skip next time!> Drinks and food were okay, a bit on the pricier side. Service was okay as well. I ordered a cup of their clam chowder and found it to be a too watery, although the clams were a nice texture.the flavor. Overall It was more of a soup than a chowder. Not really worth going out of your way for but if you're nearby not a bad option. Maybe I'll have to try the food at Mooncusser upstairs to really judge the business.> All dishes were on par.  Lobster roll was bland, needed strong mayo and some acid, lemon.  Bun was doughy, not enough butter or any.  $28 is not cheap for not super fresh lobster such as spots like belle isle with lobster tanks.  Grilled squid was good.  Oysters nice.Chowder watery.  Ross's grenache perfectly chilledFries a bit greasy, onion rings too skinny.> Great place for a date night! There's a large and affordable selection of wines and beers, so you're bound to find something you love. I opted for a rose and left in a happy daze! If you're a seafood lover, there's LOTS on the menu to choose from. We ordered the bluefish pate, the tartare, and the fish tacos. All were super tasty, but the tacos were DEFINITELY the winner. Highly highly recommend the tacos! The fish itself was super flavorful and had a nice flaky, layered texture. And the beer batter that coated it all was PERFECT for a super satisfying crunch. The accompanying slaw, pickles, and sauce tied everything together nicely to create a bomb taco! Overall, it was a super satisfying meal and a great spot to drink and munch on some yummy seafoody dishes!> So. Amazing. Although I didn't check yelp (fail) and my bf did when recommending Moon Bar, we were a little surprised initially that they didn't have a full bar license - only beer and wine! We were looking forward to a nice cocktail bar BUT you guys - this place is a GEM. The service was great - I think the owner or manager was taking our order and he was such a nice guy! I ordered rose and my SO ordered a beer - the best rose I have had, very high quality. For the food, we got the ceviche, smoked mussel toast and the fish tacos. First off the ceviche was AMAZING and we love crunchy foods so the tortilla on the bottom was a great touch. The next, which we can't decide what we loved more - was the mussels toast. Amazing smoked flavor and I can probably eat 23 more. Lastly, the tacos did not disappoint either. The fish seemed great quality, the garnishments were cilantro, jalapeños, onions and limes. Delicious. Please visit. Then again, don't. I want to keep this one for myself. We will be back soon!","4, 3, 3, 4, 5"

This South End restaurant isn't too big so make reservations beforehand. There is a bar with plenty of seats if you want to risk it without reservations. For food we ordered (ranked starting with most favorite):Crispy Eggplant - oh so delicious! This reminded me of the Zuchinni chips they serve at their sister restaurant Kava but better! Make sure to eat every bite with the yogurt and honey sauce. Musakhan - this roasted chicken dish was a whole chicken served on top of a flatbread. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. Pikilia - this included the manakish flatbread with 3 dips, wish there was more flatbread because we had leftover dip! Shrimp Aliyyeh - well cooked and flavorful shrimpFalafel - crispy falafel served with small pieces of flatbread in a make your own wrap kinda style, no complaints hereBeef Shish Kabab - this came with two kababs, good but nothing specialRoasted Cauliflower - the yogurt sauce made this dish very heavy, wasn't my favorite but others enjoyed itShort Rib Special of the night - this was a skillet of short rib, potatoes, and cheese. It was very homey and comfort food but didn't stand out among the other dished. DrinksI tried the Putnam Manhattan and Passion Martini. Drinks were delicious. Try the passion martini if you want something sweet.Overall this was a great dinner experience. Service was kind and did not rush us at all. I will definitely be back for the crispy eggplant!> In all honesty, if I was only reviewing the food, this place would get 5 stars. Unfortunately, the service was so bad, I'm struggling to give it 4 stars. First things first, the food was incredible. There was not a single bad dish on our table- we tried the crispy eggplant (probably the favorite of our table), halloumi, octopus, shish barak (really tasty, lamb-filled pasta), kibbeh, mejadra, imeruli khachapuri (delicious) and lamb chops. Everything was delicious!Now for the service- our waiter didn't even come over to our table for 30 minutes, and then took our drink order. He came back around quite a while later asking us to order. There was no introduction to the menu, recommendation on how many dishes to order/portion sizes, and no explanations for the many different dishes that we were unfamiliar with. I think it's safe to assume that most people aren't familiar with shish barak or other, similar options on the menu. At one point, I actually asked another waiter if he had recommendations since ours was neither forthcoming nor helpful. He just couldn't be bothered to do anything but write down our order. Lastly, he brought over the check and placed it on the table without asking if anyone wanted another drink or dessert (which apparently they do serve, he just didn't offer it to us). I'm not sure if I would come back based upon our experience.> Went there for brunch yesterday with my mom. You cannot order off the regular menu for brunch. We both got the Sabich which was a sandwich that was bland and forgettable. For $12 I thought it should have come with a side.

The atmosphere is really unique with festive art work on the walls and a skull with real roses on every table. Just the atmosphere itself makes it fun. The drinks are so delicious. The food is amazing! I have the zucchini fritter taco and it was the best taco I have had in a while. This place is 5 starts for their drinks, food and atmosphere no doubt. Lastly a cherry on top they are very vegetarian friendly.> Really nice decor around the restaurant , an amazing entrance view of the seaport before you walk in.  We were seated quick and with a friendly server. To my surprise they do not have High chairs for our baby, I guess they don't expect anybody to have kids... it's not a club or a loud bar, where's the fkin baby seats?!The server offered us free flavored ice to start, she was excited to tell us that it was complimentary even know it's probably about 5 cents worth of flavoring, gee thanks. The food is quite overpriced. It tasted excellent and comes out very quick, but to fill yourself up may set you back around 40$.  All servers are instructed to tell customers from the start that the entrees are small. Their rate for one small taco is 7$.Our bill for two people ended up being 100$ , It was a nice experience but a bit overpriced .> I went to Lolita's with some coworkers after a long day and enjoyed the experience.The atmosphere was colorful with plenty of skulls, roses, red chandeliers and art if a bit loud for my taste.The presentation of the food from the grapefruit sorbet served in a dry ice induced fog with a tasteful uncharged dose of House brand tequila to the bright red ""broken heart"" margarita was on point and added a experiential element to the visit you usually don't get from restaurants when attending.The service was good and the area was clean and well maintained.The food was excellent and the portions not ridiculously over sized. My habanero chicken tacos were both hand sized, soft, and delicious.The groups favorite app was easily the avocado toast. I highly recommend it. The cauliflower fritters had a nice pop of flavor and spice, possibly aioli? As well.The churros were the best I've ever had. Long, cloud like. Not smothered in powdered sugar or filled with caramel. Just good on their own merit and served with a rich chocolate dipping sauce.The margaritas we had included the spicy cucumber, the Lolita, and the broken heart. The favorite was the spicy cucumber and the least favorite was the broken heart which was reportedly too sugary. All of them seemed to contain too much ice and water and not enough tequila.The final touch was a temporary tattoo (branding genius for free advertising) and pop rock cotton candy with our bill. The bluish cloud was a nice finisher for the night.I'd return and the only thing I'd do differently is try some of their other drinks as I didn't care for their margaritas.> I was here with a friend eating the churros. After having one, I said: ""there's the fifth star!"". I visited the Back Bay location a little while ago, and my expectations were set at that solid four-star level. It was a couple of moments of awesomeness and deliciousness (like the Churros) that awarded the coveted five-star medal.You have to start with the awesome flavored ice with a generous, complimentary, splash of tequila. What makes it 'totally' awesome is that the dry ice in the base causes a whole bunch of vapor to rise in a plume to be beheld when a server brings it over. To start with my friend and I had the Mexican Fried Rice appetizer. Dude... this blew me away. Think pork fried rice from your favorite Asian place, multiplied by five, just without the grease. All the flavors within came together splendidly with just the right amount of flair, and freshness, also especially fond of the cheeses. Now, if you're a fan of tuna tartare, definitely do not miss the Tuna Maracuyá! The tuna was of excellent quality with added ingredients to spruce it up, but not so many that the tuna becomes overwhelmed. My only critique here is that a couple of bites were heavy on the acid. On the other hand, the blue corn tortillas are a wonderful compliment! For tacos, we tried the Mahi Mahi and Al Pastor. If I give them points for anything, it's for this: the tortillas were excellent and better yet, they did not skimp on the meat! This comes as a double-edged sword though when you have this much protein relative to tortilla (and others), it takes away from the balance and makes it a bit tougher to handle. Still, the protein quality was on-point and the additional ingredients were great too, they just need a little more room to shine!Of course, who could forget the churros! Before these, a churro was a dry and cold sweet stick. Now, I realize that a churro can be a take on fried dough. There was crispness outside and fluffy softness inside. To borrow from Chris D., they nailed it. Sure, they were a little oily, but what's unhealthy tastes good, just the way life is! Cotton candy was pretty standard as far as cotton candy goes, then again, like the steaming flavored ice, it's just fun, and did I mentioned free.I passed on the booze this time, opting instead for a tamarind soda. The complete opposite of what I was expecting. I thought this would be a sweet, bubbly drink with a hint of tang that costs $8 for some unforeseen reason. The reality is that it is a little more complex than that, and quite heavy on the tang, a little too heavy for my taste, the slight level of sweetness was on point, though. Finally, the service! Even though it was busy, food came out hot, fast, fresh, and our water glasses never emptied. They have that part of the operation down pat! Yes, it's a little expensive here, value, however, lies not only in the food but the experience, and dining here is just that. The vibe, presentation, service, and of course the food make it worth it if you consider the experience holistically. In a sentence, if you just want some decent tacos, there are cheaper options, if you want a memorable night out, look no further.","4, 5, 3, 4, 5"

I usually go to their allston one but this one is bigger and was closer to the station. (Kenmore green Line) Their sides changes once in a while. They don't charge for the sides. Don't be greedy but they do refill. This time I also tried the Hot Stone Bulgogi Noodle Soup, which was on the sweeter side, not bad but was expecting udon, but came with the glass clear noodles. Prob would stick with the Tofu Soup next time instead.> Good food for reasonable price.  I'm a big fan of the portions here.  We went on a Sunday, and apparently they open at 11, but the door and Google say 10.  Please be aware of this error.  The sauce on the Galbi was fairly good, and the Dukbokki was good as well.  I think compared to other tofu places in Boston, Kaju stacks up well.> Kaju is one of my favorite places for soondubu. Classic stop for a hearty bowl of Korean tofu soup! Although I usually go to the Allston location, the food here tasted just as good.My favorite is usually the combo with the Tofu Soup + Pork Belly but I just ordered the kimchi and beef soup ($13.99) this time and would rate it a 9/10. It was a little more on the salty side but nonetheless, still tasted good if you ate it with the rice that comes with it. You get a choice of either white rice or nutritious rice. The soup is mostly made up of tofu with bits of kimchi and small beef pieces as well as an egg. They also provide a series of different banchan (side dishes) which weren't the best and seemed a little stale. They also don't offer free refills and its $1 extra charge :(Overall, the place is clean and service is friendly. Food is good and the price is quite reasonable as well.

($10.50 if we had gone with the eel variant)The clay pot arrived super hot and without a verbal warning.  But we were all experienced enough to know better than to touch the pot.  I gave my egg a flip to start the raw side cooking against the pot, then shortly realized it would be best to give my rice a nice scooping as well, since I prefer my scorched rice a golden crisp sans the burned black.  The beef, though shaved too thin, was well flavored.  The portion fully consumed, and well satisfied.A DC commented that the ramen noodles were too soft, but the egg was very well done and nicely flavored.Ice cream was a simple scoop of vanilla.  A nice end to a tasty meal.  (On another visit, it was strawberry.  The similarity was that there was no choice offered.)For those electing hot pot, I thought it great fun that the condiments to make the sauce was provided on a well contained trolley.We'll be back.  They also offer hot pot lunch specials, starting at $10 for beef, lamb, pork, or chicken breast, while topping out at $15.50 prime rib eye. $15.75 seafood deluxe, and $33 beef lover, and all the items you could want to add for a la carte pricing.Note: 18% gratuity was automatically included for our party of 8.***I did return on a cooler day for one of their hot pot lunch combos.  It was $10 for either lamb or beef, so I opted for the lamb and traded slices with a DC to try the beef.  Both were thin cut and tender and tasty, so can't go wrong either way!I played it simple and selected their included meat bullion and tossed in some scallions and fried garlic from their sauce cart.  It sufficed.  But I did sample a DC's $5.95 Pork Compact Bone Marrow w/Tomatoes & Sweet Corns soup base (aka Big Pork Bone Soup) and found it a nice rich alternative.  When sharing a burner with another, the broth arrived in a large divided pot.  However, for my own private burner at the other end of the table I was provided with a smaller pot containing my single soup base.  It was larger than those individual settings set bar side at other establishments, and so could hold everything I decided to toss in at the first go without running out of space nor cooling down overly much.Unlike the flip side of the lunch menu, the hot pot combos do not come with dessert (a refreshing scoop of ice cream).  Instead, the meat selected is accompanied by a bowl of assorted vegetables (namely greens, carrot, turnip, mushroom, and corn), and a choice of noodles (Japanese Potato, Mung Bean, Udon, Spinach, Vermicelli) or rice.Neither lamb nor beef take long to cook, so just a few swishes till the color changed over, and it was ready to eat.  Veggies were not quite as simple, as the root vegetables and mushroom should be tossed in first for a longer hot bath.  Noodles soak up some of the broth, so I threw those in close to the end of my meal.I ate all the meat and leafy greens, but some of the noodles and other vegetables made it home with me for a snack.> Being in Boston for so long I've actually never tried this hot pot place in Chinatown. I've always gone to either Q, Happy Lamb and most recently Liuyishou. And I think there is a reason why I have not gone and I probably won't go back any time soon.To sum it up the experience is just average. Nothing really memorable. The meat served to us was frozen and have bloody spot on it. Clearly it hasn't been prepared properly. The decor and color of the restaurant seems old. We were sat near the entrance and we can feel the wind chill still. And price is like around 35 a person after all which isn't cheaper than other places either. If you want to try it just to see what it is feel free to do so. But I wouldn't recommend for going more often than that. There is a lot of room for them to improve in order to compete with other hot pot places in Chinatown.> I wanted to like it because I had been craving hot pot. And I thought it was acceptable. Until about halfway through the hot pot sesh, when I took a bite of the century egg in my cilantro + century egg broth. It was rancid. I immediately spat it out and tried to go forward with the broth because that technically tasted fine, but then decided it was not worth continuing to consume if the eggs were bad. I told our server and he said that there shouldn't be anything wrong with the eggs even when I described the terrible taste. While he asked if we wanted to change the broth, he didn't apologize or offer to replace the food that was in that ruined pot. Other than that, the portions were really small. We got one of the seafood combo platters, which comprised 2-3 pieces each of several low-quality seafood items and eight slices of beef. That was about $26. And then I got a serving of four house-made fishballs because those tend to be delicious--but not these. Not only did these cost $7, but they also were not even good.> My mother taught me that if I had nothing nice to say, I shouldn't say anything at all. For this review I want to really focus on the great 5-star service received from the waitress, unfortunately I didn't get her name. I will not talk about the flat Kirin beer received and despite 3 different bottles the beer was just flat. I will not talk about the overly oily and over-fried appetitizers I went to eat instead of the hotpot, which I totally regret.I didn't read the Yelp reviews prior to going,  and if I did I would only order the hotpot.> Am I the only one who think this place is mediocre? Majority of my friends like it but I don't. Okay, servers are fast and friendly. Area is clean for most of the time. Food is expensive and okay. Mostly frozen in my opinion. Alcohol beverages are usually watery. Barely any parking in the area (but I expect it for Chinatown). Just eh. I mean, are they better than Hot Pot Buffet on the other street? Yeah. Better food quality. At least it better be. However, there are so many other options that I don't care about this place. It's usually my last choice and only if there's long waits at the other restaurants.","4, 4, 3, 3, 3"

Amongst my favorite dishes, these have to be my top 3 1. Dried scallop fried rice 2. Salt and Pepper Pork Chop 3. Crispy Pork Belly The duck, char-siu and crispy pan fried noodles are also great! The quality of these dishes is unparalleled and the serving sizes are enormous. Given all of this, I would recommend taking out or ordering your food via Uber Eats or GrubHub (the menu here though is not as extensive for some reason). The atmosphere of the restaurant is your average Chinese bustling space but the food is just as fresh taken out and even better enjoyed at the comfort of your own home.> Loved, loved, loved it! I came back twice on a long weekend trip to Boston. While I did not care for the service when I picked up my to go order of house special fried rice and wonton noodle soup around 5 pm on Friday, I returned the next day for lunch because the food is that good. I think because the place serves Cantonese style dishes and its name is Hong Kong Eatery, the main folks who interact with customers speak English and Chinese. When I called to pick up my order, the woman conversed with me in English and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. On Saturday, I spoke Cantonese with the server. He initially provided us with a kettle of tea and I requested two glasses of water.  I noticed many other customers ordering dishes, eating what they could/wanted and asking for the leftovers to be boxed and bagged up. I guess that's why the server wasn't surprised about my party of two ordering a bowl of plain porridge ($2.95), one you tiao (fried dough, $2.95), a plate of shrimp scrambled egg rice ($8.95), a plate of house special fried rice ($8.95), and a bowl of wonton soup ($7.95). These tend to be my general go-tos, especially the fried rice and wontons. Ever since I was a kid, I have loved a good fried rice, and sadly, not many places make it well. I believe if you order and eat in the restaurant, you get more food than if you were to do takeout. My comparison was done on the fried rice. We definitely had a mountain of it at the restaurant and ate a good amount before asking it to be wrapped up. The amount of food in that box was similar to what we received the day before. The wontons and soup are delicious and for plain porridge (congee), I thought it was creamy and flavorful. Mei Sum serves a small cup of congee with duck eggs, scallions, and beef for $2.25 and it would be hard to decide which is better given its size and flavors. You tiao at both, while not a must, is a highly recommend for lapping up the remaining congee in the bowl. I didn't think the shrimp scrambled egg rice was anything special. The rice tasted a little hard and I found the peas under cooked. The eggs were good. I was astonished by its size though. For less than $60 for both trips, we had plenty of delicious, comforting, and familiar dishes.> Hong Kong Eatery is a staple in Chinatown. They serve up classic Cantonese dishes and the food is consistently good. The wontons here are probably one of the best in Chinatown They really pack each wonton with meat and shrimp! Surprisingly, they have really good HK milk teas but one thing to note is that they always seem to run out of them during dinner time. I guess with competing bubble tea shops in the area, they aren't too worried about it.> Came by to get some to go soup for hubby. I went to a bubble tea nearby and it's not far from where I parked. Since they still do take outs since this pandemic is going on around the world. The area inside is quite small. There were only few tables in there I'm sure it gets packed when it's busy. Had to wait for my order for about 5 or like 7 mins. They cook the stuff fresh after you order it so it's freshly done when you get it, which is good. But I'm not too sure for those people who are in a rush. I also got the roasted pork which tasted just like the typical Chinese roasted pork that you get in most places, there's nothing really special to it's taste for me honestly. I also ate it the next day. So I don't know if it's one of the factors. But as far as the other people who ordered without a soup it was out in less than 5mins plus it's totally not busy around this time.> I've been to Boston PLENTY of times to visit family as well as for work.  And sure, I've dined at institutions and other ""must eats"" during my travels.  So by all means, while strolling around Beantown, be sure to stop in the Regina Pizzeria and have The Giambotta; indulge in a huge pastrami sandwich at Sam LaGrassa's; and of course, go to the Union Oyster House for a bowl of their legendary New England clam chowder.  However, after a few days, I always get a hankering for my own kind of comfort food, aka Cantonese cuisine.  Anytime I see the words ""Hong Kong"" in the title of a restaurant, my interest is immediately piqued, mainly because I want to see if that place can justify having my birthplace in its name.I also was encouraged that Hong Kong Eatery received high marks from long time trusted Yelper (and one time Bostonian) Susan H, so I ventured into the compact section of the Boston Chinatown neighborhood in search of some tasty grub.At first glance, this joint has the familiar trappings of a classic Chinese restaurants found all along the East Coast.  The front window has a selection of roasted and barbecued meats, and the interior has tightly arranged tables to maximize the number of people that can get squeezed into the cramped dining room.  As a side note, what's up with EVERY Chinese restaurant needing to have long-walls that are lined with mirrors?  When trying a new Cantonese restaurant, always need to determine how the kitchen prepares the classic Wonton Soup.  I was a bit on the hungry side since I walked about 20 min from my hotel, so I also added two meats to my dish - some bbq char siu pork and Chinese style beef brisket.  Let me say up front, the wontons themselves were delicious.  The dumpling skin was tightly wrapped around a package of seasoned pork and shrimp based filling.  And unlike at some places which serves puny wontons, these versions were a good size.  I deduct some stars since the accompanying meats, particularly the char siu was very subpar.  Usually good char siu is tender with a nice glaze which is not overly sweet, but where you can also taste hints of five spice and soy sauce.  The roasted pork here was tough and tasted like it had been hanging in the window too long resulting in the meat drying out.  Beef brisket was okay.  Some pieces were very tender, whereas, other pieces were on the fatty side and too tough.  IMHO, not worth the extra $3.This place is pretty popular with the locals and I observed LOTS of students from the numerous colleges popping in for take out and dishes of roasted meats over rice platters.  It's a challenge to rate this place, especially if you've been to other more famous Chinatown neighborhoods in places like NY and San Fran.  But overall, this place ain't bad and will satisfy the craving for good Cantonese food if visiting Boston.","5, 5, 3, 4, 3"

Honestly I doubted that Asians do lobster better but this place completely changed my mind.We ordered the XO lobster with sticky rice, fried tofu pods, and snow pea leaves. That XO lobster dish was AMAZING. I highly recommend (like Mike Chen said) asking for their homemade chili sauce because it just makes the lobster dish somehow even better. I have no idea what XO sauce is but it's delicious. The rice was sticky as described but you could still separate out the individual kernels. Lobster was the bomb dot com and I honestly wish we had ordered another XO dish. There were a million tofu pods (go Asians for bang for your buck) and they were perfectly fried but still soft on the inside. They also came with a great dipping sauce. The snow pea leaves were pretty standard and good and we ordered them more to get some vegetables in our system. Thank you Mike and Jean for the recommendation!! Best lobster dish imo> Very good especially for the lobster in a variety of ways not over cooked and very juicy and flavorful. We had the fried garlic lobster and it was awesome. The soft shell crab in an egg batter was delicious but didnt taste like crab but this is the first time I've had soft shell crab at all so I don't have a point of reference. But I must say that although it was fried properly it was a bit like an oil sponge so I felt compelled to ask for a couple of slices of lemon which is good with seafood anyway. Yang Chow fried rice, Beef Chow Foon... are not the reason to come here stick to the seafood. Also I found out that if you order the beef chow foon saucy so to speak they don't include the beansprouts which I love yang chow fried rice doesn't bring bean sprouts either and I forgot to ask them to add them. Bummer. Salt and pepPer wings were underwhelming but fried beautifully just lacking in taste. Surprise of the night was fish maw in a seafood soup as I tasted this wonderful rubbery piece of fish air bladder I had to call over the waiter to ask him if my ""seafood"" soup had beef tripe (which I love btw) so similar in appearance taste and texture was it to beef tripe. I will definitely be exploring this curious and delightful organ in the future and recommend you do the same.

My reasons is the quality of the meats and the flavor of the broth. My absolute favorites here are either the spicy mala or the pork bone broth. Get the mala if you enjoy spicy and pork bone if you don't. As for the meat, you really can't gone wrong with any of them, my personal all time favorite and what I get every time is the prime rib.

I felt like I was being strung along and the people I was dining with were also very frustrated.Fortunately when we finally sat down, we were able to order quickly and got our food quickly as well. The food was good. They have a wide variety of cuisine and use good quality ingredients.> My fiancé and I came here on a really busy Saturday night(tonight) and we waited over an hour and a half to be seated which we didn't mind because we got drinks from the place across the street. Of course then we became very hungry and just wanted to eat! This was our first time trying hot pot in Boston. We are from New York and have tried hot pot all over the city so we did not expect much at this restaurant. Let's talk about the food and the service after we were finally seated. 1. The food was great! Definitely one of the better hot pot places we have tried. We tried the black chicken bone broth and the mala broth. Make sure to try both soup bases before you start cooking the food. So delicious! We got an assortment of vegetables, seafood and the fatty sirloin. The mussels, scallops and the fatty sirloin were our favorite! I also got a mojito and my fiancé got a glass of the Pinot. The food and drinks were delicious!2. Our service started out amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and very polite. We even got more soup for our broths without even asking. Sounds great right? Then the 45 minute mark hit and we were ready to order more food and drinks so we asked for more soup for our broths. But a few minutes after we were served the waiter came over with the check and turned off our stove...We were so confused because we still had food on our plate that we didn't get to get and wanted to order more. We both felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome afterwards we quickly ate our food and paid the bill. We understood it was a busy night and they just wanted to get other people seated but it didn't make any sense to indirectly kick us out without even asking if we wanted anything else. We were going to ask if there was a time limit per table but didn't even bother because it became so awkward since we felt so rushed.Overall I would have given the place a 4 star rating if not for the service towards the end. The food was great but the customer service just did not live up to par. We would love to go back on a day that's not as busy. Hopefully we have a much better experience next time!> I have been here several time and every time I come the service is borderline mediocre from the host to the waiter. The place is relatively large as they serve hotpot and sushi. I have been to many hotpot restaurants and by far Q is not the worst but it is not the best in terms of quality of meat. Yes, they offer pretty much what other places offer but I find the food just okay. There is nothing that wows me here!> Amazing hot pot!!!! So much fun and delicious.Waygu short rib was fantastic. The Mala broth was very spicy but delicious . Great place!!!!!!!","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

The selection does change a bit for the seasons, but it's pretty consistent. It's a nice start to try vegan food, but also keep in mind that it won't be cheap and not everything is uber healthy.> Pros:-Some of the meat substitutes are great!-Quick service-Beautiful designCons:-Pricey!-No nutrition info available! :( Hoping they'll change this in the future.-Most items are covered in various sauces/cheezes that don't add much flavor. They have a dispenser for the Beet Ketchup and the Chipotle Aioli so you're probably better off asking for your items without them and just adding the amount you want!-Feels a little heavy to have the carb-y patties on buns-Desserts were disappointing, and I was tempted by the cupcakes but there were fruit flies attacking the Raspberry Tiramisu!--Pesto MeatballTastes like extremely tender meatballs, though with the various sauces this is super messy.Guac BurgerI skipped the sauces and the sweet potato/quinoa/black bean patty is delicious, though doesn't taste like meat--main flavor is sweet potato.

I would recommend skipping the fries and trying another side. The salad bowl is full of fresh, delicious veggies and is very filling.> by Chloe is vegan.  So you can expect anything you get there to be vegan friendly.  Their burgers, their cheese, their sour cream, their bacon... all vegan.  Their baked goods - yes, vegan.However, some vegans have some additional food constraints, so by Chloe has clearly labeled certain allergens on their menus: soy, nuts (specifically almond, cashew, peanut, pecan, walnut), gluten.Of their collection of pastries, two are gluten free: Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Chocolate Cupcake with Vanilla Frosting.My take: their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good, however, for those who are not diet-ly constrained, I suggest skip this cupcake.  It was lightly sweet with a different flavor and texture than I'm used to for chocolate cupcakes.Tip:  if you're getting a cupcake here, take a peek before you leave the store.  Mine was on its side with frosting all fallen off by the time I reached my destination.  I spread the frosting back on, tucked the cupcake back in the holder, shut the box cover and shook it like crazy, up to 30 degrees askew, and it was perfectly fine.  Thus I suspect the person boxing my treat did not tuck it in correctly.***Their Raw Vanilla Bean Chia Pudding (chia seeds, madagascar vanilla beans, raw almond + cashew milk, raw agave  nectar, raspberries) wasn't very flavorful, but was otherwise fine.The weird thing was that I was expecting the dessert listed on their online menu (Pineapple Vanilla Chia Pudding $5.95 CHIA SEEDS, PINEAPPLE, VANILLA, COCONUT MILK + SEA SALT).","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

Well done!> I went to Lulu shortly after they opened. They were giving out delicious fudgy brownie samples, and I tried the pear ginger scone from the bakery case. I thought it had good flavor, but I didn't love the texture. I enjoyed a pear jasmine kombucha, and I also had the barbecued cauliflower. It had really delicious flavors and good bread (it tastes grilled not like bbq sauce). I would definitely get it again without the vegan cheese. I look forward to going back and trying their full menu, especially the waffles!> Awesome spot for a fresh and healthy lunch! My friend and I checked it out today and were so impressed!

The neighborhood favorite opens up at 1130am Mon-Sat and is normally sold out of its limited menu by 2pm. Ralph and Arthur run a pretty tight ship. Everything is made fresh daily and there are no substitutions, featured items or surprises of any kind!One type of Sicilian style cheese pizza is served by the slice (~$2 a piece, cash only). There are a handful of other menu options, of which the arancini is certainly the crown jewel. House wine is served at just under $3, making this one of the last places in town you can have a meal and a drink for under $5. This is not necessarily the best pizza you'll eat in your life, but it is consistently fresh and delicious. In short, this is a spot you'll want to experience as a regular rather than a tourist. One of the few Boston establishments worth the long lineup.> We stopped in here around 11:45am on a Saturday in February. There were about 15 people in line in front of us and the line took about that long, 15 minutes, which was somewhat surprising to me. Kinda thought it would be a little quicker since everything is already cooked. When it was my turn we got 2 slices and a spinach & cheese calzone, and a pepsi.  It was $10.45 - can't beat the prices.  I wanted to try pretty much everything but we were making multiple stops in the area for a little food tour. The pizza was good but not wait in line for much longer than I did good. The line got a lot worse before we left. The spinach and cheese calzone was okay in my opinion but my girlfriend liked it. I guess all the good pizza in my home area made it not seem too memorable. They had arancini, pizzette, paninis and panzarotti as well -- all cheap prices. The staff are excellent and they move very fast, it's just that there were 2 guys doing the counter for an endless line. One was doing to go orders which were massive like 10 slices and whatnot. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but I do want to try the arancini sometime.> Last month, my friend and I went here for lunch. There was a long queue of about 20 people but the line moved pretty quickly. I got two Sicilian cheese slices and a spinach and cheese calzone. Although a bit burnt, the cheese slices were cheesy, airy and crispy.  Very yummy! You can't beat a $1.85 Sicilian slice.The spinach and cheese calzone for $5 was also warm and tasty. If you want a good quality lunch under $10, I highly recommend this place.> I like the old-school charm of this place, but the food didn't really stand out.I got a slice of their pizza and wasn't very impressed: the crust wasn't very crispy and I thought that the cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. A little disappointing given how big a fan I am of the square slice and the hype reviews for this place.Will say though, given that it only set me back $2 and the service was friendly, I've made worse decisions in my life.> Mama Mia, that's good pan pizza!! And at $1.90 a slice, you can't beat it with a stick!! Mangia! Mangia!","5, 4, 4, 3, 4"

Cost was $21 plus tip. We were seated before 7 PM.Our server Kenny was great. He knew the menu, directed us to the better items on the menu, and was friendly.Our water glasses were filled and an assortment of bread was brought out. Bread was pretty good, nice variety in my opinion. The restaurant was comfortable and warm. A lot of wood around the dining area. Looked pretty nice overall. This was our first time at this restaurant.We started off with the chilled raw oysters and the burrata for appetizers. Both were fresh and very good. I agree with another review that there should be greater variety for appetizers as most here are raw or seafood based. None in the party had wine with the dinner. For the main entrees 2 people had the aged prime ribeye which was delicious. My steak was ordered medium but was mostly medium rare overall. Still very tasty and tender. Nicely seasoned with a good char. One person in the party had the aged prime delmonico cooked medium. Was also perfectly done and tender and juicy. Another had the Aged prime New York Sirloin. The last person in the group had the Salmon Fillet. I had a taste of it and it was cooked nicely with good flavor. Seemed very fresh as well. For side the table shared Potatoes au Gratin, asparagus and the lobster Mac and cheese. These sides are large and Kenny our server had mentioned they can feed 2 to 3 people. I tried all three and they were all very good. I believe the table finished all of the sides. Overall it was a very nice dining experience. The restaurant was a little loud later on since there were a few 10 to 12 person parties going on. I would recommend Abe and Louies to anyone looking for a great meal. I would visit again as well. Thank you Kenny and thank you Abe and Louies.> One of the best rib eyes in town! Your classic upscale white glove steak house. Small intimate feel compared to the other local steakhouses. They do a great potatoes au gratin. Their lobster Mac and cheese is somewhat bland. Broccoli and brussels sprouts are well cooked and well seasoned. Sad to say that I've actually never tried their dessert.> Just a quick note...My GF/I had dinner yesterday(2/23).  While the food/service was impeccable.  The dining atmosphere there has really gone downhill.  One table near us was inhabited by a family with extremely LOUD and UNRULY toddlers who were given free reign to wander about and bother other guests.  Another table was populated by a group of drinking/foul talking woman...who I would swear doubled as longshoremen considering their language.  Finally, ballcaps in the Dining Room? When did Abe and Louie's start serving hot dogs??  As a repeat diner there I was very disappointed by all of this.  It is not what I would expect out of $300+ dining experience.I hope you make some improvements in the future.  I would LOVE to return again soon...but this last visit does cast some doubt on this.","5, 5, 4, 5, 5"

Unfortunately, that Prix fix menu didn't really appeal to anyone in our group and we ordered off the normal lunch menu. The food was really good (I had the Roasted Half-Chicken) and the service was excellent. However, our bill (with a drink) came out to over $50 a person which is a bit pricy for lunch.> In early December, I dinned with friends and former coworkers at Sportello in Boston. I had eaten here multiple times previously when I worked just down the street, but now that I had been out of the city for a year, I thought a visit to an old friend was worth it.  And as a result, a Yelp! Review.  The staff is always accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu.  From recommending wine to offering opinions on their favorite dishes, it is refreshing to hear the staff take a stance vs. feeling like they have never tried anything on the menu before.  For pasta which is made in house every day, you can't go wrong.  The gnocchi were thoroughly enjoyed with infused lobster and the tagliatelle with bolognese meat sauce was probably the best tasting at our table.  The squash risotto was tender with hints of brown butter and parmigiana.  Meanwhile the pork chop was also juicy and cooked to perfection.  We didn't save room for desserts, but we were certainly tempted by the cannoli and coconut cake offerings.  I missed you old friend, and am already looking forward to my next visit.  I recommend Sportello when you are in the Financial or Seaport districts of Boston.> My boyfriend and I had received many recommendations for this restaurant so we finally got around to trying it. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and were sat at the swanky bar. The atmosphere was very chic but a quiet and a little stuffy for my taste. The menu is a bit confusing, it includes a ""let us cook for you"" section and a la carte but it's not clear what this means. We figured our waitress would explain this to us but instead after having to flag down a different waitress to order drinks and then once our original waitress approached us again she pressured us to order right away and seemed annoyed when we kind of fumbled around the menu. We ended up ordering the Tagliatelle, duck and side of Broccolini. Each was very good but in truth way too expensive for what it was. It was fun to try because it's been considered a hot spot for about a year but I won't be returning.> Best pasta I've had to date! I got the potato gnocchi and it was heavenly. The gnocchi just melts perfectly into your mouth. It was an exquisite blend of flavors with truffle infusion, mushrooms, peas, and lobster. Highly recommend! The food came out incredibly quick and I was surprised to be able to be seated immediately despite my entire party not showing up yet. Got the melon and vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over it for dessert. I would skip just because it was two scoops with ice cream with an espresso shot layered over it for $10, cost benefit analysis does not add up.","5, 3, 4, 3, 3"

The entire restaurant was filled the night that we were here, so it was quite difficult to hear sometimes with all the conversations going on.> Updated in December 2019:Grill 23 consistently provides both incredible food and service and I'm here to give it that fifth star. All I really need to say is that not one, not two, but THREE bartenders have independently remembered me, and both where I like to sit and what I like to order. I can't name a single other restaurant where I've experienced hospitality like this, and it really stands out.Luckily, in my opinion the food really does match up to the charm, which is not something you might expect given how upscale the dining room is. There's no question that the restaurant caters to an older and classier crowd, and seems to host a lot of family gatherings and business meetings, but if you have a chance to stop in to the bar for a nice meal I highly recommend you do so.First of all, the 100 day (wet) aged prime rib-eye is a stunner, featuring 18 oz of meat from Brandt farms for $60 (previously $59). I tend to be quite disappointed with wet aging, but this is probably one of the finest examples of the technique I've ever eaten. The flavor of the steak is robust and complex, and I promise you won't be disappointed. I've compared it myself to their own dry-aged prime NY strip and I vastly prefer the ribeye, although your mileage may vary. That said, I wouldn't recommend ordering this cooked anything beyond medium rare (Grill 23 is also one of the only places that can properly do a rare plus, which would be my recommendation) as you'll lose a good amount of both flavor and texture.The bar burger itself is also a success in my opinion. It seems the blend itself may change with the season, but when I ordered it there was American Wagyu in the blend, along with a layer of thick-cut bacon and a really fantastic remoulade. It honestly took me by surprise, and the herb & parmesan fries it comes with are also delicious. I was tempted to call it the best burger I've had in Boston, but I have to try again before making sure.If I wanted to have a classic meal in town, perhaps something that would satisfy the whole family, Grill 23 would be at the top of my list. Sometimes tradition tends to outweigh culinary excitement, but Grill 23 is the rare exception, where memorable service and delicious food go hand in hand.> My husband and I went on a 'Steak Tour' in 2018, trying to find the best steak in Boston. We ended up finding the best place, and this is it! We've been back about 20 times since then, and it may have saved our marriage more than once. Since Yelp has a 5000 character limit, please see the photos for a full review of all the dishes that we have tried (about 10,000 characters!). We typically get and share two appetizers, one entree, one or two sides and dessert. We almost never get to try the non-steak entrees as we come here when we crave steak (and by steak, we mean specifically their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye""). But for those who don't want to read:TL/DR: Everything is good but their ""100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye"" is the BEST steak in Boston.> The least expensive entree at Grill 23 & Bar is their vegetarian option - Spring Mushrooms & Wheat Berries $29 arugula, parmesan, citrus.  For entrees with animal protein, it was their Steak Frites $33.  A la carte pricing starts at $36 (swordfish steak 10 oz) and $38 (twin filets 8 oz), while side dishes to accompany them ranged from $12 (for their mashed potatoes and heirloom carrots) to $16 (stuffed mushrooms).  Thus it took Dine Out Boston (aka Restaurant Week, aka RW) to lure me in through their doors.Just as I was about to sit down, I noticed that water had dripped on to my seat.  They quickly wiped it up and apologized.  A bread basket with an assortment from red speckled flatbread to twin fluffy rolls, with squares of focaccia, and sliced brown bread of sorts tucked in.  The butter was soft and spreadable.  My personal favorite were the sweet rolls.Their $38 3 course Dine Out menu was printed right on the bottom of that day's single sheet menu.  I had no trouble making my choices:CORN CHOWDERwith roasted peppers & charred cornBRANDT FLAT IRON STEAKduck fat poached potatoes, parmesan creamed kale LEMON CURD TARTwith blueberry preserves, malted meringuesThough I also got to sample my DC's choices which differed from mine (we all picked the steak as our entree):CLAM & GREEN ONION FRITTERSwith bacon remoulade, friseeBROWNIE SUNDAEwith raspberry swirl ice cream, white chocolate puffed riceOf the appetizers, I felt mine to be the better pick, as the fritters were soft and not very meaty.  We all ordered our steak to be medium rare, but the results ranged a bit more than to be expected.  One friend's steak was a bit thinner, and so that might have been a reason for her steak to be closer to medium than the rest, however it was still not ideal.  The potatoes were buttery, and the creamed kale a nice touch.  Both desserts were well enjoyed, and we each felt we made the better choice.  A sweet ending to an enjoyable meal.We wondered if this would be one of those classy establishments which would have those cool crumb scrapers.  Well, definitely not after the first course, however, the bus boy was impressive as he quickly and professionally cleared our table of appetizer plates in one trip, while playing plate Tetris.  Later when he was about to set down the utensils for the dessert course, out came the scraper!The longest wait was for dessert.  Otherwise the timing was satisfactory.$21 valet parking.  Individual gendered bathrooms.  Noisier a space than I like prefer.  I wonder if it might have been more quiet upstairs.","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

Music was very entertaining and the atmosphere was inviting to have a good time. The only thing I have to say is that while guests are waiting to be seated since the place is too small there was really not an area were we could hang were we didn't feel like a bother to the waiting staff. I also thought of some of the appetizers a bit pricey for the portions. (Empanadas, tasty but is just one small empanada cut in half). We asked for water and they never brought us, but they were as attentive as they could.> To be fair, I've only been here for taco Tuesday but it's not the best in town. On Tuesday's their tacos are half price ($2.50), but this excludes some of their best selections so be sure to ask before you order!The chips and salsa have increased in price, and I always find it a little off putting when you have to pay for them to begin with, but they're worth it. Salsa is fresh and authentic.My go to's are the chicken, fried fish, and shredded beef Lorenza tacos. They're not always consistent as the chefs may rotate, but you get a good bang for your buck. My favorite is the Lorenza, but beware it's excluded from the Tuesday deal.But the churros are an ABSOLUTE MUST. They're my favorite in the city thus far, and I've had plenty. They're fat and crispy on the outside but thick enough that they're still soft and squishy on the inside. I hate it when they're too thin and fried to a crisp but these are perfection!> From being a transplant to Boston from San Diego, I have high expectations for good Mexican food. I can say that this place didn't disappoint. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing. There's a few tables outside for warm days. I got chicken enchiladas a mix of rojo & verde and they were amazing paired with a Hibiscus margarita which were both amazing. I can't wait to go back> I have both eaten in and ordered from El Centro. Both times I got a combination of different tacos. All of them were delicious. I have also tried the margarita and it was pretty delicious. Really recommend to anyone looking for Mexican food in the South End!> By far the best & most authentic mexican food in Boston. The plates here are to die for & so are the margaritas. Cant go wrong with tacos, toastada, or one of the specials. The carnitas verde was expecially good. FYi no reservations here!","4, 4, 5, 5, 5"

I was pleasantly surprised by how cheap everything was.  Beware of the lunch hour rush, as it can get pretty hectic.I ordered a hamburger and fries, which came out within 5 minutes. The burger was pretty good, it had a nice smoky flavor. The fries were huge and plentiful, I couldn't finish all of them.I'd highly recommend Pete's to anybody looking for a big meal at a good price.> When they open at 6, you best believe all the construction workers are in line! They have minimal parking space outside. Not too large as it is a quick service. Food served on styrofoam plates. We ordered a breakfast platter with three eggs, 6 slices of bacon, large potatoes with 2 crispy pancakes. What won me over was the pancake. They are round, fluffy and has a certain crispy flavor which is unique and tastes really good.Service was okay but that pancake really was so goood!> Came here based on Yelp due to proximity to Harpoon brewery, waiting for our tour to start.It is part of an industrial complex with a lot of commercial trucking activity all around. There is an old sign for the restaurant outside. The place is packed with local workers for lunch on Monday, 5/20/2019. I view this as a very good sign.The lunch menu is huge and cheap. The breakfast menu looks even bigger. The line flows steadily to order. We are able to get seating inside, but outside would have been fine.The food takes a little while to prepare, but it is packed and everything is made to order.I got Pete's Steak Combo with fries. HUGE sandwich and the fries were completely unnecessary. I tried one just to taste it, but I am stuffed. Very tasty mix of meat and cheese in a soft roll. Five stars.Wife got a tuna melt, daughter American Chopped Suey, which is like a goulash. Both five stars.Staff is very nice and professional.There is nothing to complain about. Five stars all around.> Huge portions and decent prices! There is seating available there. Friendly folks! Would go again!> One of the few times yelp reviews have let me down. We had the pancake which the 9 yr old said tasted weird. A steak egg and cheese sandwich that had no flavor whatsoever. Weird entry way that we didn't know where to even get in the door.  Overall just meh. Filled our hungry bellies but wish we had gone elsewhere.","5, 4, 5, 5, 3"

Solid wine list as well.Dishes tried:- Polpo/octopus appetizer (5 stars, best dish)- artichoke carpaccio with black truffles appetizer (4.5 stars)- oyster appetizer (4 stars, too many items added, hid true oyster flavor. Still solid dish)- branzino entree (4.5 stars. Cooked perfectly! Simple and tasty)- scallops entree (4.5 stars. Great flavors, slightly small portion with only 4 scallops)- filet mignon entree (5 stars. Cooked to absolute perfection - medium rare)- broccoli rabe side dish (4.5 stars)- mushrooms side dish (3.5 stars, tasted all garlic)- bombardino/ Italian donuts dessert (4.5 stars. Super fresh, still warm and light)Would rate 4.5 if I could, but closer to 5 than 4 due to  prime service.> I came here on a Friday night according to my friend's recommendation. We had Foi Gras and oysters for our appetizers. The Foi Gras came with fruits on the side. The fruits perfectly neutralized the oily taste. In addition, the raw oysters came with lots of ingredients. The fishy taste was completely avoided by the sour taste of lemon juice and the bitter taste of the ingredient. As for the main course, I highly recommend the veal. This course was not like normal veal dishes which come with a side. This course used mashed potato as the sauce at the base which completely enhanced the soft taste of the veal. I ordered a Japanese whiskey for my dessert. The best thing for it was that they used a perfect rounded ice ball inside the drink so the drink didn't get diluted swiftly.> Review #1040One of the best meals I've had in Boston!

My filet mignon was a little too dry, even as I asked for a medium. The meatballs were good, but both my friend and I felt like it tasted a bit funny for some reason? We also enjoyed the molten chocolate cake, which was a solid dessert choice.I love the decor and the table set up on the inside. For once, I don't feel like I am so crammed sitting at a Boston restaurant or continuously have to make ways for waiters to get by the aisle. My server was friendly but as always (as I said in an earlier review), in my limited experience at high-end restaurants, I don't believe I've encountered anyone yet where I was like okay this person entirely deserves a 20% tip. In fact, it is always these family-run businesses where I'd feel welcomed and be willing to tip 20% wholeheartedly.Their bathrooms are unisex and located by their entrance. They are clean and have both paper towels and hand dryers available. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here. Next time, I'd definitely order the ribeye!> Whether you're having oysters and cocktails at the bar or dining experience at a table, you will be no less than impressed by Sorrelina. The service is professional and top notch. I will personally vouch that Sorellina has some of the best oysters in Boston - convince me otherwise. Every meal I've ever had has been incredible and doesn't taste mass produced like some restaurants. If you're taking someone here they will not be disappointed and you will look like you have great taste. Perfect for dates, probably too intimate for coworkers UPDATE:I just had dinner at Sorrelina tonight and am really disappointed by my experience. While the food remains amazing, our server lowered our dining experience. He told us about the ravioli special but failed to mention that it included mushrooms. When I ordered it, I was surprised by the mushrooms and the fact that he never even asked if we had allergies or dietary preferences. He also didn't come back once during the meal to see if we were enjoying it. It wasn't busy at all when we were there so I'm curious as to why he slipped up or if the overall service has gone down. I'd like to come back to see if this was a one off experience but I'm nervous to waste a dinner out again.> I honestly expected a lot more based on reviews. The food was great, but portions were extremely small. I ordered the cod fish, which was good but could have had more flavor. The menu stated it also came with lobster and gnocchi. There was probably 1 bite of each on my plate. However, I tried the lobster gnocchi main dish was tasty. Apps I enjoyed were the tuna tartare and salmon tartare. I didn't enjoy the wasabi on the tuna tartare though as I am not a fan. The burrata was alright, nothing special. We also ordered the eggplant side dish which was decent. Truffle fries were pretty good too! For dessert, we ordered the cioccolato, bombolini, and gelato and sorbet. I loved the cioccolato. It melted in my mouth. We also ordered ice wine which was delicious! It was sweet with an amazing flavor to it. It was pretty pricey at $35 per glass but I'd say it was worth every penny! Service was absolutely impeccable. Great place for a business dinner or dinner for a special occasion. Just make sure you order enough apps and sides due to the extremely small portions!","5, 5, 5, 3, 5"

Place is very small and intimate so you probably will need a reservation to go here.We had an 8:45 reservation and I was running late but my boyfriend got there about 10 mins early and they sat him down.DJ was one of our waiters and he was very pleasant and constantly checked on us. They were other waiters that checked on us as well so the staff is very attentive.I ordered the crab ravioli for the starter and that was so good! It has small pieces of asparagus that was cooked just the way I like it. Amazing flavors. For my main dish, I got the shrimp scampi. It was a hefty serving! Great flavors as well. Definitely took the rest home lolDessert was the Panna Cotta which was decent .. really sweet in my opinion. My boyfriend had the calamari, veal and melted chocolate cake and he enjoyed his meal! I will definitely come back here for a meal - completely satisfied with my experience.> Came here last Friday for dinner with the bf. On the basement level, this Beacon Hill spot feels romantic yet hole-in-the-wall and serves up a delicious range of Italian specialties. Service was above and beyond. Upon arrival, a staff member took our coats. Plus, our waiter checked up on us frequently. We originally came here for their 3 courses for $38 deal (recommended by our cooking class instructor), but ended up opting for entrees. I got the Fra Diavolo which was spicy, tomatoey, had perfectly al dente pasta, and was topped with a moderate portion of steamed lobster. My bf got the Carne (beef tenderloin) which came more rare than expected (but delicious). It came with grilled asparagus and irresistibly garlicky creamy risotto. It's hard to believe that each of our meals was in the $26-28 range! We finished off the night with a capucinno and small latte.Grotto nails it. Come here if you're looking for a fine dining experience that feels authentic and unpretentious.> My boyfriend and I wanted a nice, romantic dinner during our stay in Boston. We picked Grotto because of its high reviews and quaint atmosphere, and it seemed like a perfect date spot. We arrived and found that the restaurant is dramatically smaller than it appears in photos, which makes for an intimate atmosphere, particularly if a loud couple is sitting adjacent to you -- a couple we were practically on top of. In addition, every conversation seemed to echo around the room, so if you're looking for a comfortable atmosphere, it's not here. We asked to move to a different table due to the fact that we on top of another couple talking at the top of their lungs. After we moved and got situated, we opted for the prix fixe menu (appetizer, entrée, dessert). After we gave our waitress the order, she must have disappeared into a portal in the back room, as she was gone for a long period of time. To say that the service in this restaurant is slow is like saying the Pacific Ocean is big. Accurate but also a gross understatement. A glacier could recede, melt, form a river that stretches to Boston, flood the restaurant, and that would have been faster than refilling our water glasses.The food, itself, was ... average. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I ordered the appetizer with the bruschetta, the shrimp scampi, and the pana cotta dessert. My boyfriend got the calamari, spaghetti and meatballs, and melted chocolate cake. The restaurant brought out a dish of olive oil and bread to start after some centuries had passed since we made our initial order. There must have been a mixup in the kitchen because the bread we were served was essentially room temperature Wonderbread with an Italian moustache. Olive Garden would have been vastly superior. The rest of the meal was eh. When we finally got our check, we noticed immediately that we were charged the price of each item ordered as opposed to a prix fixe price. The couple next to us also experienced the same issue and was charged for wine they never received. When the same waitress returned with a new check for them, they discovered that it had not been remediated at all! We're very disappointed because for the cost of the meal, we did not get what we paid for ...Dining at Grotto is an experience in patience.> The interior is a lot nicer than it's exterior.  Perfect romantic date spot with nice classical/jazz music and candle lit lighting.  However, I expected the food to be a whole lot better.  To start, we had the Calamari.  We expected fried calamari, but it ended up being grilled.  SO much better.  My friends and I were very pleasantly surprised and scraped the sauce clean.  5/5 recommend for appetizers.Bolognese:  4/5.  Not bad.  The best pasta dish we had on the table.  The meat tasted really gamey -- maybe they didn't use the freshest ingredients?  Pretty mediocre.Gnudi: 3/5.  My friend enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special or great.Scampi: 3/5.  Very fishy tasting.  It was so fishy that it left a bad taste in my mouth for a while after small bites. They're pretty generous with the shrimp though.All in all, the servings are large and the ambiance is nice.  Not in my top picks for Italian restaurants.> Really enjoyable dine out Boston experience here at Grotto. Came with a friend for lunch and had their 2 course menu for $20. Their regular menu, however, is not too expensive and I believe they do offer a price fixe menu regularly. Ambiance is nice, a break from the construction and other happenings right outside the door. The restaurant is down a set of stairs from the sidewalk, so is easy to miss. I ordered the ensalata mare- white bean paste, grilled calamari, arugula, and lemon vinaigrette- and it was delicious. My friend had the cavatelle as her appetizer- ricotta pasta, sausage, peas, mushrooms, and pancetta in a cream sauce- which was also great. For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi and she ordered the risotto. The gnocchi was prepared with short ribs, mushrooms, and Gorgonzola and was so so delicious. The risotto was huge, the majority of it went into a to-go container (it is a much more excessive amount after eating another pasta dish).I would definitely return to grotto, especially considering that it is still reasonable outside of the deal given by dine out Boston.","5, 5, 3, 3, 5"

It's a Cuban inspired restaurant with Caribbean food as well. There is a parking garage across from the restaurant and they validate parking. We were greeted when we entered quickly and seated. There were only patrons at the bar and 1 other table so pretty light at the time we came. Despite this it took our server a bit to get to us. I'm not sure what he was doing, maybe on a break. After maybe 10 minutes he delivered waters to our table and told us about specials. We both ordered the flight of mojitos and what I originally ordered I was later told they didn't have anymore. The server came back twice after a lengthy period to tell me that what I wanted wasn't available. He was apologetic enough but the restaurant didn't comp me in any way for the inconvenience or extra wait.My meal was good enough. I enjoyed the flight the most. Not sure I'd go back unless I could guarantee a seat at the bar for better service. The bartender was real nice and helped us with other drinks we ordered.> My review will begin with saying the Ambiance is very nice and accommodating. Parking was no problem and validated which was nice since we were not from the area.  I've visited many Cuban  spots as you can see on my page, however this one wasn't my favorite but wasn't totally the worst! (Keeping reading )I began with the yuca frita and ajo. Unfortunately the yuca was very tough as if it was previously frozen. The mojo or ajo sauce that it came with was also pretty blande (thank you Jesus for salt)  For my Dinner  i had the bistec encebollado (steak w/onions) as a side white rice and beans. Steak was not cooked  the way I liked it. I asked for  well done and got medium rare.The MOJITO however was delicious and had a little kick! My friends had Chicken which was on the dry side. Another had the Lobster now that was AMAZING! Have the LOBSTER! The other person had the Fish which was Ok. Plátano Maduros were delish. Tostones were a fail!The place had its pros and cons but worth another shot next time I'm in the area.> The restaurant is nice little spot with the Cuban mural in the hall and a front clip of a classic car. The food was good have to say I asked for medium and actually got a medium cooked steak which a great start. The dish wasn't to die for I'd probably get something different if I were to go there again. For the (pregnant) Wife; said the virgin pina cola was great, thick and rich flavor which is a plus. So over all why a two star I'm being generous here luckily the food was overall good for the price and we were have a good time between friends and family; our waiter wasn't very friendly and our party felt rushed and at the end of our meal just right after we paid the waiter said are you guys done we have another party at 8:30pm.> Very spacious and convenient spot near the Boston Medical Center area. The menu is huge and they have a number of small plates and large entrees. It looks fairly traditional. I came with a large party for a work lunch and didn't want something too heavy so I ordered a garlic shrimp and toast. It was fairly unremarkable. The bread tasted storebought and didn't have much flavor. There were a 5-6 shrimp that were sitting in a salty, garlicky, buttery sauce, but the flavor was a little flat and the garlic tasted like the prepackaged/jar type.> I came here per a Cuban friend's rec so I came knowing it would probably be more authentic. However, to my disliking, the Ropa Vieja's meat was rather salty and almost didn't finish it. The cost of the dishes compared to how much of it was given was also not congruent. I felt that instead of $20, it could have been placed at a lower price. As for now, I intend to try more Cuban restaurants in the city.","4, 3, 2, 3, 3"

I've been here a few times for dinner here and there as a quick decision since there's never a wait, regardless of if I'm with one other person or as a group.The service has always been attentive and friendly and we never have to wait long for our food. When I came last night, our waitress noticed our side dishes were running low before I even did and refilled them, which I thought was really nice. The food itself is good enough for Haju being the only Korean place in this area so I can't really complain.> I actually stop going here after their management changed few years back. My friend worked here for summer and he invited me to have dinner with me so I was like, why not? It is a free meal. We ordered tteokbokki, fried chicken with soy garlic, bibim bap and french fries. Contrary to my disbelief about this place, the dishes here weren't bad at all.Next week or so, I decided to bring another friend of mine to try pout cheese donkatsu, as it is hard to find the place that serves this dish in Boston. They surprised me again, and this was the best dontkatsu I had so far in Boston.I recommend getting fried stuff here, that's where they are specialized in cooking I feel like. I tried different kinds of rice dishes was disappointed  those so I do not recommend ordering those. Please try cheese dontkatsu here, it's really good. (But they only serve it during lunch time tho, I don't know why)> Pretty satisfactory spot for Korean comfort food! I came in solo on a Sunday night after spending all day at Tatte across the street. I ordered beef soondubu (medium spicy) which comes with rice and a little bit of banchan. Banchan selection was small but I asked for a side of kimchi and an egg to put in my soup and they brought it for me free of charge! The meat was beef chuck instead of the thinly sliced beef which is what I'm typically used to but it didn't really change the flavor of the soup. It wasn't the best I've had but it satisfied the cravings! If I'm ever in the Berklee area again I'll probably drop by to try the other stuff on their menu. They have a wide assortment of Korean dishes from fried chicken to tteokbokki to BBQ to all the different soups Service was friendly and fast and the place wasn't that crowded despite it being dinner time on a weekend!> I really wanted to try Budae Jjigae (army stew) and I decided to try this place since they had a deal! I chose set 2 that included the buda jjigae (2 steam rice included), seafood pancake, a choice of sides (coleslaw, steamed rice, or french fries) and 2 sodas for around $30! Food:Banchan - There wasn't much banchans. I liked the fishcake more than the onions.Budae Jjigae (army stew) - It was okay. It felt like it was missing or lacking some toppings. But it was pretty filling in the end from the other items in the set. Seafood pancake - It was good and there was a good amount of toppings!Fries - They were super fresh and hot, so it was good.They forgot to give us our sodas, but thats fine! We were really full in the end and had to take leftovers home.Overall: It is a good place to go to if you are craving Korean food with good deals!> The food was decent for walking distance within the area if you're craving for something Korean. We got the Set 1 ($25.95) which comes with Tteokbokki and we chose the Small Chicken Bites Mild.Tteokbokki: 3/10Barely anything besides just cheese and mushy dumplings...Chicken Bites: 10/10Crispiest and yummiest chicken I've ever had, these were so good! If you get Mild, it's basically just Crispy Chicken with the addition of a 'mild' sauce that comes on the side.Overall, the food wasn't amazing but service was friendly! Place is small and there's usually no wait. Decent for a quick, convenient Korean meal if you're nearby","5, 4, 3, 3, 3"

If I'm craving a good juicy burger, I know where to go. I'm a basic burger type of girl. I don't want anything too over the top. Two patties is the most I can do to get full. Lettuce and tomato and sometimes I would add bacon if I'm in the mood for it. Their fries is a must! I love their regular fries. I just wish they would give a bigger portion considering the cost. But the quality is definitely there. Their cookie and cream milkshake is a must try as well. Small is the perfect amount. Everything about this place is great. This location in particular is always packed. The location is right on as it is Right on Newbury Street. But no parking lot and limited parking spots for street parking. I would recommend taking the T here or stopping by for lunch or dinner before or after shopping in the area. This location has a ton of seats, plus seats downstairs.> Shake Shack is always a go to for comfort food when I'm feeling for a burger. Their buns are so soft, the burger patty is tastey and cheese melted just right with fries always crispy.I've been here many times since they've opened. They're always packed, even to this day but since more locations have opened up in Boston the crowd is more manageable and they've expanded the restaurant to downstairs making more space to eat especially when winter occupies the seats outside.My favourite burger will always be the shackmeister burger with the crunchy shallot inside. They did it as a promotion once or twice but have stopped. I wish they would bring it back OR make onion rings as a side just like them. I'd eat on the side or stuff them in my burger.Now my go to is the Smoke Shack with the peppers and bacon, I usually add lettuce and tomato to it.> I ordered food from this place today and they mistakenly labeled my number, which resultant my food was never prepared. The people who work here refuse to check my order despite its been over 30 mins waiting and people who came after me have already finished their meals. Finally I talk to the manager and she checked my order was indeed not being prepared at all. I asked for refund and left. I understand there could be mistake during busy hours. But it's truly not professional to handle cases like this. They could at least check the order upon customers  requests, instead of avoiding any responsibilities.gyang> Love the fresh burger that shake shack offers. Plus the best service I have recieved at a fast food restaurant!> Have always enjoyed Shake Shack every time I've been! Service is friendly and super quick! Had their fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. The fries are always great too. I typically like shoestring style fries but the fries here are thicker, but oh so delicious. Will always recommend when you're looking for a quality chain burger joint!","4, 4, 1, 5, 4"

The food was great, even though the portion was a bit smaller than the normal dishes. Scallops is strong recommended, it has a creamy and smoky flavor. Lamb chops was also pretty good, it's really juicy and tender, I love it.The prices are pretty reasonable as considering to the portion of the dishes, will go again!> Went when it first opened. Poutine was interesting but Duck Fat in Portland or the Gallows still was much better. Also had the lamb lollipops which were quite good but nothing ya can't make with a sous vide and cast iron pan.Would go back in a few months for a drink> Disappointing.  I've always loved La Voile (both the Brookline and Back Bay location); I figured Bar a vin 1855 would be a safe bet given it's the same management.The food (scallops and potato croquettes) lacked seasoning, which was perplexing because usually French food has a very nuanced flavor profile.  Even frozen Trader Joes has more seasoning.The salad nicoise was also underwhelming.  The tuna was seared to perfection, but lacked seasoning.  The fingerling potatoes were undercooked (fork could barely pierce), while the haricots verts were slightly overcooked.  The ambiance is lovely.  I could see going here with friends, sitting outside on a warm evening, and ordering a bottle of wine and potentially ordering an app that's hard to mess up.> This place is a hidden gem! A cozy French Wine Bar on Newbury street serving a delicious French menu with small plates & full size entree options. The service is attentive and second to none. Highly recommend!","5, 5, 4, 2, 5"

My friends and I are addicted to this place. My go-to order is either the Indo fried rice or the pad thai. I've tried the crispy basil chicken, pad see you, and rama garden as well. The food usually comes around to a little less than $10, but they take only cash if it is under $10. In times where I forget to bring cash, I just order a thai iced tea which is also delicious!  You order at the front, they give you a number, and then you go pick up your food (dine-in & to-go) and utensils. Although it is often packed with students, you can somehow always manage to find a seat. I also appreciate the to-go containers because they're microwavable & reusable!> I go to BC, but I feel like I still eat here every week. It's pretty far, not gon lie, but my friends are addicted to this place. I usually mix around with pad thai and pad see you, but my friends are obsessed with the indo fried rice? ig, its whatever floats your boat. but I am a noodle girl so...But really this place is pretty good and like mysteriously addicting.> I went to BU and I STILL come to Nud Pob 10+ years later. That's how good it is.Big portions, cheap prices, and delicious food! Can't ask for anything more. I usually order the Thai style Pad Thai with crispy chicken, Drunken Noodle, and Chiang Mai Curry Noodle. The Chiang Mai Curry is my favorite thing to order. It's HUGE. Always two meals for me and it's super delicious. The noodle dishes are great as well and I can usually get 1.5 portions out of it depending on how hungry I am. The service is quick and the food is always piping hot. I always get extra chili and love that they have it sitting in the self service area so you can have as much as you want!> Mixed feelings on dishes. Came here a year ago for a noodle dish and got a huge serving which tasted great, and for a cheap price. Came back a couple days ago for lunch and got the yen ta fo pink noodle soup off of the special menu. Very underwhelming, small portion. The seafood and fish balls inside were ok, and the noodles were so broken up and stuck together that I'm pretty sure they were not fresh. My favorite part was the fried crisp on top (eat it first so it doesn't get soggy). Was still hungry after unfortunately. Soup broth was very tangy salty - too much for me to finish (maybe not supposed to?).They do have complimentary tea and water self-serve (tea is really hot so just mix 50:50 with the ice cold water).> This place is college central! Located right next to BU dorms, theres alot of college students here. I discovered this place while I was on my journey to finding the best Thai Iced Tea. This place is one of my tops for Thai Ice Tea. There's street parking only, best to take the train here!When you walk in, its a bunch of tables where you seat yourself. If you dine in, you may grab metal utensils near the registers. If you're doing take out/ prefer plastics, they're near the door. Free water there as well! I ordered myself an Indonesian Fried Rice, it was perfect, just wish there was a bit more of the fried chicke. My friend ordered the Thai Basil Fried Rice and it was SPICYYYY. I like spicy food but this was 80% burn your tongue hahahaWhen you leave, you can ask for take out boxes/bags for your leftovers. If you finished, you sort your dish/utensils and they will clean it! It's a very casual place, not very expensive and pretty good food!","5, 4, 5, 3, 4"

The rigatoni is big and doughy, soaking in the flavor of the ragu nicely. Ziti alla Amatriciana: Tasted pretty average, not as impressed with this one. North End pastas have all been home runs for me, so maybe it's just harder to compete, but this pasta didn't taste special at all to me. It was good by all means, but not worth $22... you can get much better for this price.As for service, there were a lot of waiters talking amongst themselves in the corner and not really paying attention to when we needed something.> Not awful, but overrated for the North End. Asked to add spinach to a dish and they said no. Waiter didn't ask to add cheese or ask if we wanted dessert (normal interactions). Granted it was Valentine's Day, but felt neglected.Chicken parm and meatballs tasted like reheated prepped meals - cold and chewy.Was so excited for this meal but unlikely I return.> Came here because the restaurant we wanted to go was full, and we didn't want to wait an hour.The service wasn't bad. Food didn't taste so good, though. Very salty. Wife and I developed mild laryngitis after the meal. Gulped down large quantities of water due to the heavy dosage of salt used in the food.The place was pricey too. $22 for a plate of ragu. After I finished my dish, I was still hungry, so I ate bread. This is a restaurant where tourists and visitors are ""slaughtered"", so why should one expect so much? Fooled me once, I guess. Won't be coming here again.> What a mediocre place. I'm utterly disappointed. This was in the center of the little Italy and one of the most popular restaurants in the area. I came with very high expectations and left with great disappointment. The dishes were really mediocre. You can tell the spaghetti was cooked without dipping back in the cold water before served so it lacked the needed texture. The dishes were priced higher as expected but it didn't come with the expected quality. I ordered the shrimp appetizer for $16, which came with 3 shrimps. While the waitress came asking how the dishes were, we replied as honestly and told her they were just ok. She then proceeded as she heard nothing and left. It was a busy Saturday night and they crammed the space with as many seatings as possible. So crammed that every times people past by, they would have to turn sideways or they pumped into you. The entire dining experience was horrible and I wouldn't want to recommend this place to my friends for sure.> Amazing Italian restaurant in North End Boston! Chefs and waiters are mostly Italian and they serve real Italian pasta. They have a really nice wine bar and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic. I tried Mom's Lasagna della Casa and Ravioli con Aragosta. Both were delicious but the sauce of the ravioli was just something else. At the end I was just dipping bread into the sauce. It was that good lol. Highly recommended restaurant!!","4, 2, 2, 1, 5"

If you're craving something sweet, I would highly suggest the french toast- perfectly toasted with the right amount of cinnamon, chocolate sauce and fruits to top it off. Breakfast dishes with egg were made almost to perfection and the country style potatoes were nicely seasoned. Honestly, no complain on this end. If you're in the area looking for a quick and delicious breakfast spot, Theo's is the place! (Cash only)> Amazingly great breakfast!!! Everything was freshly made, and delicious. Very good price for a massive amount of food (Big Boy special).Phenomenal pancakes too!!!> Found this place based on the reviews and proximity to our hotel! We got there at about 915am on a Saturday and there was no line. We were sat in about 5 min, but as soon as we were seated a line started to form. When we left the line was probably a 40 minute wait so plan on that. The food was good. Nothing crazy special about the food, but was good hearty breakfast food! We ordered the breakfast special, super breakfast special, and eggs Benedict! All were very good. Staff was very nice and the service was good. Had a good conversation with a staff member there while eating. Felt like a mom and pop restaurant! And was definitely as described...a COZY corner! Would come back.> No frill tiny and authentic Italian diner in North End. My friend and I sat right at the bar and was able to watch the chef cook all the delicious omelets right I front of us. They use tea a l eggs and stuffed the omelets with so much goodies! This place is cash-only though> Absolutely loved Theo's. I got the ""Big Boy"" and it was just what I needed. The actual restaurant is like having breakfast in someone's home. You MUST use the bathroom...it's such a trip! I went behind the counter and walked thru the kitchen. Staff helped me pull open a trap door in the floor to access a small wooden staircase down to the basement. After I was down washing up I had to knock on the trap door in order to come back up.

Wednesday night burger night holds a special place in my heart.> We had been wanting to check our Brewer's Fork since we saw it on the top 50 list! We walked in Saturday night at 7:30 PM and did not have to wait at all. The service was really great until the end of our meal when it was hard to even get the servers attention to get the bill. We started with the flatbread salad. I loved this unique salad and was glad they didn't offer a Cesar so it encouraged you to try something new. The salad dressing was a nice vinaigrette and paired well with all of the delicious toppings. We did find a hair in the salad which was a bit of a turn off...We had the sausage pizza which was by far my favorite. The crust is so thin and chewy - just how I love it! You could taste the fennel in the sausage but it was not overpowering. The waitress recommended the carbonara pizza. It was certainly tasty and I enjoyed the Brussels and pork cracklings, but it was not as good as the sausage one. It was exciting to try something different and new though. Sadly they do not have a dessert menu. But the beer menu is top notch! Overall, I would return to try out the other pizzas!> After our first 3 visits here, would have given this a solid 4 star rating, but went yesterday and come to the conclusion it seems they lost their magic here a bit.No complaints on service - the staff is awesome.The pizza and the fantastic curated beer selection are the real stars here. But - the pizza was not as great as we remembered now; perhaps we had someone new doing the pizza oven? While the toppings were very tasty, I fear the pizza was a bit overloaded with moisture - as the middle of the pizza was far too limp and soggy for a successful thin crust pizza. We also ordered the chicken thigh appetizer which sounded great, but poorly executed; it was white long grain rice just simply dropped in the skillet and the chicken was a bit overdone and not grilled or roasted (which makes thighs all the more disappointing). All that aside, it's a great room, and even better in nicer weather with the patio open.We may give them another shot to see if we just hit an off night in the kitchen. But - with Ciao in Chelsea closer to home, that's still our go-to pizza for now.> This is the first time here . We ordered a grass feed burger and a chicken pizza it was delicious.  The burger was good the way we liked it medium . The server was on point .> Went here yeserday after we landed,had an amazing salad, Marg pizza and cheese board. They have several selections on wines/ beers as well.

If your reading I am the one who ordered two mixed combo platters with kofta kabob as the extra added protein, the spicy chicken wings and fries and a coke :) Aman just picked it up! They have THE BEST halal cart style food. It extremely similar to their New York food cart. I believe this is the same owner as the one near my undergrad school in queens. The sauces are GREAT! I love the white sauce and the spicy sauce has a nice kick to it. The lamb gyro and chicken are both flavorful and I just LOVE their rice. Compared to The Halal Guys and Chicken and Rice guys these guys are my favorite!!!!> Went in to try the halal gyro and chicken platter and was surprised to say it's amazing and food is so so good and nyc style and also sauces are best. Best customer service and good is at very reasonable price. I would go again and again.Thanks for opening this over here in Boston. Thumps up.> So I was recommended this by yelp here is my review I'll keep it short. It tastes good but whoever is saying this is how felafel is supposed to taste is right... it's absolutely delicious. But I don't go to felafel spots for the felafel I go because I can't wrap a felafel to save my life. So I order from here and all they do is throw some ingredients on pita bread fold it and hand it to you in foil and parchment paper. Like news flash, I do that at home. I hate when I'm biting into a felafel wrap and it falls all over the place. So the wrap sucks. Did I say I was going to keep this short? Good.> Very happy that there's a halal place in this neighborhood finally and what's better is their food is very tasty, neither salty nor greasy. The seating area is clean, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is friendly. I've been here for  lunch two  days in a row. I can see myself coming again very soon.> I am so so so happy this place opened up in Boston! I was never able to satisfy my NY chicken and rice craving even with the addition of halal guys in Boston. This place is just what I needed! It is absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I got takeout here (due to the current pandemic). Place seemed clean and staff was nice! She did a good job making the food. I like my food very saucy and she met up to my standards. The green chili sauce, white sauce, and hot sauce are all mouth watering. I almost went back the same day and got another place it was so good. My boyfriend had two of the pita wraps and loved them. We will definitely be back again (over and over to be specific :) ) I'm usually good about getting pictures but we were so hungry and the food looked too good, I forgot‍","5, 5, 3, 4, 5"

Lydia Shire's excellent Italian restaurant in Beacon Hill is a great getaway -- you always know what to expect and it will always be comforting, homey, and delicious. The spaghetti options are consistently alluring and I find myself drawn to the Bolognese time and again -- just perfect for a chilly winter evening, beefy and warm and tomato-y. The pizzas are delicious as well, and the mozzarella bar is fun, although not the ""best"" mozzarella I've ever had. If I'm honest, the puntarelle and cinnamon bread paired with the burrata on this particular occasion we visited were even more memorably than the cheese itself! We did think the garlic bread could have used more garlic, and the yuca gnocchi with crispy pig ears was tasty but the portion was definitely on the small side ($26 for 10-12 gnocchi and 3-5 pieces of pig ear).Dessert was fine -- we got the seasonal cookie plate but probably would opt for something more festive next time (I'm just not the biggest fan of Italian cookies, liking American gooey cookies or Scottish shortbreads and millionaire's bars a lot more). Wine was yummy as well. Service was a little odd -- I think our waiter was new and a bit overenthusiastic, and the original bill he brought us included our neighboring table's food as well. Overall, though, Scampo is a fun and fancy night out without being overly stuffy. $150 total after tax and tip, for 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert plus coffee.> I hesitate to give 5 stars allays but this place earns it. I walked in and was greeted with wonderful smiles and brought to 4 top. It was cold rainy night and this place was bright and lively.They brought a garlic green paste and breadsticks and that was cool.Then we ordered the nam  with prosciutto So fresh And delicious with yummy balsamic oil.Then the soup was buttery full of crab Then the meals were calves liver & mashed potatoes .... it's a lunch special but the server asked and they had no problem with a special request. Our server Francisco was the best. He explainEd all the fancy words on the menu and made great  recommendtions and checked on us and brought laughter to the table.I ordered the pesto  scallops pasta and so creamy and thick and I really couldn't finish it.The atmosphere is fun everyone is smiling and I will  be back here> I ate dinner here with a large group. The food was bad-to-dangerous and the service was all attitude. The only thing allowing for this review to be a 1 was the work of the gentleman who I believe was the manager, Zan. So for the bad/dangerous dangerous. Most egregious were the orders of the two pork chops. One person ordered medium and the other medium rare and both were flat out raw in the middle- we're talking sashimi grade. I was one of the recipients and was pretty grossed out by it. Now...stuff like this happens, and I like to think I'm reasonable. People are imperfect, including chefs, so I actually don't hold the chefs responsible. But once our food arrived no one came back to check on us to see how it was going. Finally after 12 minutes I grabbed a bus staff member and asked them to send over our server. 5 minutes after that, that she arrives and was grumpy about being told that her food was raw. Now having lost my appetite both from the raw pork texture and the healthy dose of attitude, I told her to just take it back - I didn't want anything else. I had considered asking to have it fired some more, but it took too darn long at that point. I was not satisfied with this exchange with the wait staff, so rather than make a scene with her, I got up to talk to someone at the host/hostess stand. Zan, who I think was the manager, was understanding and took both items off the check which was the minimum right thing to do and was apologetic for his wait staff's disgruntlement. But given that it was not edible (unless you were planning on dying of trichinosis that evening) and that I didn't eat anything else I suspect they could have been more creative in offering a solution/resolution. I came back to the table to find out that the same wait staff member tried to argue with the other recipient of raw pork that ""he ordered medium rare."" Ridiculous and that's what prompted me to write a review. Waitstaff, too, are entitled to a bad day, but there is no world in which this person could have possibly been right in this situation.  Separately, the Indian / Italian fusion wasn't working. Sorry, prosciutto with chutney isn't a thing, now or ever. The other dishes were fine - best thing on the table was the pea puree and breadsticks that preceded dinner. But you can skip the elephant ear bread, the overcooked naan, and the overpriced mozzarrella bar. Several other diners' fish dishes were overcooked. Calamari was the only reasonably-priced-not-that-weird-of-a-dish-passable item. Speaking of overpriced. No parking validation and $35 for valet? The website touts that you can park in the MGH garage, but guess what? To get any reasonable pricing you need to be patient or visitor of a patient. That was the real kick in the teeth at the end of the expensive night.  This place should never get more than 3 stars based on price and offering alone. But attitude from wait staff over dangerously cooked food is completely unacceptable. And it's such a shame. The restaurant is in such a cool building and has a lot of potential.> Another restaurant that we ate at two times in two days! We flew in from PDX and had a delicious dinner, lobster pizza, Italian wine, it was fantastic. So fantastic that we retuned with another coworker for lunch the following day! We had the Cesar salad, margarita pizza, a la vongole and coffee... another delicious meal!The champagne upon checkin to the hotel was also a lovely touch... can't wait to return!> We had an amazing experience here. Both my wife and I were in Boston for work and had the luxury of staying at the Liberty and made Scampo a date night. Fava bean purée that was served immediately was incredible. Parmesan cheese sticks for dipping. Unreal.  Chef Lydia stopped by to say hi and I asked her how to make both and she didn't hesitate to tell me, which I thought was so nice! We did have an amazing people watching opportunity, but that was just luck.If you get a chance, have a drink at the lobby bar and head to Scampo for dinner!","4, 5, 1, 5, 5"

The chicken itself was crispy and flavorful. The fried rice was not good because it was mushy and tasteless. To mention, I was charged an additional $3 for substituting the white rice for fried rice.Parking is very difficult as there is no parking lot available -- street parking.> I've been going to Chinatown cafe since I was a child and I'm so happy it's still around. As an adult I must say I enjoy their food a lot more now than I did as a child. They have increased their quality of food. Their portions still remains the same. They aren't stingy like other restaurants. The exterior doesn't attract me, nor does their interior, but it's their quality of food. Right when you walk in you can see the meat option-pig, duck, spare ribs, chicken, you name it. Everyone here is super friendly. Their staff here mainly speaks Chinese, but they do have the cashier and the male answering the phone who knows perfect English. These two are super nice!!! The menu is in Chinese and in English which makes everyone's lives easier as there is a full description. They have seats if you prefer eating there. They also have hot water and tea you can help yourself with if you do decide on eating there. My go to is their wonton noodle soup with spareribs and their general gao chicken. Generally I like eating there since I like my chicken nice and hot when it comes out. Both of these cost no more than $20. Again, their portions are a lot bigger than other places. My boyfriend and I shared both of these plates and we even had some general gao and rice left over. They have gender neutral bathrooms!!! (Pretty gross though if you ask me but does the job) FYI- cash only! No debit/credit cards.> Wow. Where do I begin? Wonton noodle soup with brisket.  Terrible. The wontons were as big as my first and the pork was shaped like a meatball. The wonton wraps fell apart as I picked them up with my chopsticks. The meat tasted like a rubber ball.  The pepper/salt calamari wasn't seasoned enough.  Not only that, but they were sneaky.  They layered the box with too much lettuce.  From the picture, you'd think it was a calamari salad. Oh, and we left the restaurant, we heard the manager lose his temper by cursing up a storm in Cantonese.  Not cool.> This place rocks! Was in Boston recently and got take out from Chinatown Cafe twice because it was so good! The first time we ordered several orders of their roast duck over wonton noodle soup and their tofu ""wonton noodle soup"". The portion size was so generous. I counted at least 6 large shrimp and pork wontons and 5 or 6 pieces of duck. The noodles and soup were great! The next day we ordered a few more of the same items and decided to try their bbq pork this time. It did not disappoint. For ~$10, it's such a deal for the amount of food you get. Each bowl is enough for at least 2 people.> One of the classic restaurants thats been in Chinatown for as long as I can remember. Its not a fancy waited restaurant but a place to get comfort food for about $10 or less.Chinatown Cafe does get packed so the best bet is to call and go in to pick up. If you have time and want to eat there, they have a good amount of tables and chairs you can choose from. Food comes in very generous portions for the price you pay. Theres complementary water and tea and a gender neutral bathroom :) The walls are decorated with pictures of Chinatown from many years ago, very historic. Most staff there speaks some to fluent English :) an alternative is just to tell them the number from the menu.","4, 4, 5, 1, 1"

Honestly, I highly recommend. My go to place for dim sum at odd hours is Dim Sum Cafe. Food is always hot and delicious. They've got a good amount of fan favorites, even though mine wasn't available that day (shrimp with long rice noodle). The prices were right and the location great because we all went to tea do after for some games and bubble after.Also I just wanted to flag that there is a $30 minimum for credit card charges. I'll keep coming back again and again.> This place is the worst dim sum place I've ever  visited. Super bad service. The waiter would yell at you for not giving enough tips. Why would I give him tips when he gave me such bad services? Everyone please don't go to this place. They don't respect customers. Treat customers like shit!!> So as far as yelp goes, every place in chinatown essentially has 3.5 stars. There's no shining 5 star. There's no, pretty good 4.5 star. This place was across the street from where we were standing at the time, it was cold out, and there wasn't a wait. I would like to point out that the cat thing wasn't waving. I don't know what that means but I feel like I should at least say so here. After a quick traffic jam near the entrance (the place is small), we were seated immediately at one of the group tables and provided some tea. As alluded to by another reviewer, there isn't much in the ways of vegetarian options here. I saw vegetarian dumplings before coming into this place and that was all I needed. We also ordered scallion pancakes (how can you not), and vegetable lo mein. We had been dying of thirst all day long and both pulled the trigger on a coke. The food actually came out in a staggered fashion but quickly. The lo mein arrived first and it was a nice, large plate of thin noodles mixed with sprouts, onions, and the occasional green pepper slice. The scallion pancakes came out next and they were followed by the dumplings. When you're already thirsty, Chinese food is only going to make matters worse. There was no coke anywhere to be found. I chugged the hot tea provided as my serum sodium climbed. I caught the server as she passed our table and reminded her about the 2 cokes we ordered. She made some annoyed gesture and continued walking. The noodles were spectacular. They were absolutely delicious and frankly some of the best lo mein I've ever had. The scallion pancakes were crisp TO DEATH and also amazing. The ""vegetable dumplings"" had pork in them so thankfully my meat vacuum GF bit into them before I did. That's kinda bullshit. We never did get the cokes. Ever. Might I suggest hiring servers, the people who are interacting with the customers in Boston, that can speak English or at least understand basic restaurant vocabulary like ""coke"". If you're vegetarian beware also maybe bring your own beverages or someone who can translate ""coke"" or ""sprite"" for you.> Not sure where to go with this review.  I admit I am not a dim sum expert but I have an adventurous palate and lots of Asian meals under my belt. My wife and I ordered a variety of chicken feet, dumplings, buns, etc.  The food was delivered quickly and at a reasonable price.  Despite that, nothing impressed us... almost boring. We expected more.  For example, the pork ribs in black bean sauce consisted of a handful of bones with almost no meat and a couple of Chinese black beans.  It was completely flavorless which is disappointing considering how delicious Chinese pork can be and how intense fermented black beans should be.  The service was brusque and rushed which is not atypical for ethnic restaurants moving lots of people through.  We will probably try another dim sum place next time we visit Chinatown.> The actual rating is 2.5 stars but will give it a 3 star for serving dim sum during dinner time.Came here on a weekday at around 8 PM, and we got seated right away. Then close to 8:30 PM, more people showed up, and the restaurant was pretty much full. We ordered ha gow, shu mai, pork in black bean sauce, green, and pork congee. The ha gow skin is very thick, and the shrimp is mixed with some other stuffing. Doesn't seem to be very fresh. The shu mai doesn't taste very fresh, either. It has a different texture to it from other dim sum places I've been to. The pork in black bean sauce does not have the black bean sauce flavor at all, and rather it is covered in either sesame or cooking oil. The greens are good, but that is hard to mess up. The pork congee is good with generous serving but lacks salt. Unfortunately, next time for dim sum, Winsor won't be the top of my list.  Overall, it was a disappointing visit. The service was also severely lacking. The 3 stars are just for food. If I were to factor in the service here, oh well, it will be much lower. First of all, it took much time to get iced water. Then, it took much time to put in our order where the waiter walked towards our table multiple times, we made eye contacts, but they just walked away. Later, the congee was served without a spoon, so I had to ask for that twice. If I were to rate its service and compare it with other Boston Chinatown restaurants, this is definitely one of the worst.","4, 4, 1, 3, 3"

Started with the rouleaux (Cambodian pork spring rolls) and chilled avocado citrus soup. Rouleaux came two pieces with veggies, quite tasty but the rolls were disproportionately small compared to the veggies. Soup I expected more avocado taste, but the chunks were surprisingly what I expected. Good tangy flavor, but I wanted more avocado.Mains were the seared scallops and the braised beef short rib noodles. The portions were actually surprisingly large for Dine-Out week, and the meat on both was cooked to perfection, especially the braised beef - very moist, not dry. I wish the scallops had a bit more seasoning and flavor, but the corn succotash with it was perfect, but there was a bit too much pepper overall. The noodles on the beef dish was well-executed, but nothing unique or special.Dessert was mango sticky rice and coconut milk custard. The rice on the sticky rice was a little hard, as though it dried out in the fridge, and mango is.. Well, deliciously mango lol. The coconut milk custard fared much better, but the consistency was more cake like and less custard, although it tasted deliciously like custard. Texture makes me think it was in the fridge for too long too, though.Overall, we'd come back for the a la cart menu, but we're undecided on dessert. Good value for Dine-Out week, though.Yay: the mains and spring rolls, custard tasteNay: mango sticky riceMeh: avocado citrus soup, size of the apps, custard texture> Second visit to The Elephant Walk but the first time for dinner.  Booked a reservation well in advance, and I'm glad as the restaurant had just a few empty tables.   Our waitress was lovely and knowledgeable about the menu.   Started with Rouleaux, crispy Camodian spring rolls that you wrap in lettuce and dip a tuk trey sauce - delicious!  Flavors compliment each other perfectly. Entree Crevettes Et Pates De Riz Fraiches, rice noodles sauteed with shrimp, snap peas, bean sprouts, chive and red pepper in a garlic sauce, nice dish and a perfect portion size.   So many things I wanted to try on the menu so I will have to go back!   Friendly staff and great location in the South End.   Will become a must visit when in Boston.> Amazing! Had a great sampling during A Bites of Boston food tour and had to come back!My husband and I both got the Dine-out Boston menu as well as cocktails and everything was fantastic!

Noodles King,Boston,4,2,Null,Null,Yes,Null,"Noodles, Chinese",Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,"This restaurant is located in the Longwood Galleria's food court. It is not your typical ""American"" Chinese food; thankfully! The noodles and dumplings are very authentic- confirmed by my Chinese friend. The ingredients are fresh. And you can watch the cooks pull and boil the noodles. It's quite fascinating. My go to is the #6 Spicy Dan Dan noodles. I have tried several other dishes but none compare to the Dan Dan noodles. The Dan Dan noodles are as thick as spaghetti soaked in a ""spicy"" red sauce, mixed with ground beef, peanuts and herbs. In my opinion the dish is not spicy but I also have high tolerance of spice.  The pork dumplings are also very good but are not always available and usually take longer to prepare. I believe the dumplings are made ahead of time then possibly frozen and cooked as needed. If you want your typical ""American"" Chinese food there are two options next to Noodle King.> Probably the best option one could get in the Galleria. The noodles take a bit of time to come out even when there is no line because they boil the noodles fresh for each order. Their shanxi hand pulled noodles are nice and chewy with plenty of chili oil and garlic. The noodles also come with a lot of bean sprouts. I've tried their other noodle soups but they just aren't as flavorful as the shanxi hand pulled noodles.The shandong pork bao is huge and packed with meat.  The flavors are milder than the noodle dishes because the bao is not spicy.This is one of the more authentic meals you could get in the area, but I wish their portions were larger for the price.> FYI those THICK-CUT noods in #1 can now be substituted  into ANY of the noodle dishes for an extra $3!!! I've ordered #2, 3, 7, 8 so far w the thick-cut noods and it's completely elevated my noodle experience here!It's not written anywhere on the menu or counter space, so just tell the lady when ordering:-) YOU'RE WELCOME> Noodle King is excellent, and exceeds expectations given the location (I mean both Boston and a random food court in the Longwood Area). Staff are businesslike but quick, which is what I want from a food court vendor, and the menu is down-to-business as well, with a mix of hand-pulled dry noodles and noodle soups, and some vegetarian options as well as bao and dumplings to boot.I ordered the dry noodles (#1, $11.95) and the Shandong pork bun ($3.95). Both were really yummy -- the noodles were flavorful with garlic and spice, and not too oily, with some crunchy bok choy as well. The bao was STUFFED with meat, tofu, wood ear mushrooms, green beans (seems atypical but it was good), and rice noodles.While my total bill ended up being $17 or so which is quite expensive for lunch, the bao alone was enough for me for lunch, leaving me quite a heap of noodles leftovers for dinner. Not too bad, I'll be back!> I usually don't leave reviews. But I have too. I was visiting a family at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. I was running around allMorning and had nothing to eat. Visit my family for 10 mins then my friend and I walked over to the long woods food court. I order 3 different noodles to try. They look so good on yelp . But I turns out it wasn't. Not my taste at all. So we threw out the 3 noodles and a shrimp dumplings.When I got back to the hospital. I was not feeling good. I thought it's because of the oils in the noodles. But when I got home yesterday night .. I started to have chills and the fever all night. And now my stomach is rumbling . I definitely know this feeling. I have food poisoning. Not something I'm looking forward too since I have little ones to take care of.","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

Look no further.Great drinks, great food with seafood accents (the crab guacamole - very nice!)But come here for the deals too! You will find me here every Monday for $1 Oysters, I'll let you all figure out what the other specials are!Hint: book a day early or you won't find a tableOverall:Great, simple taqueria with fun drinks and specials!> Date night for taco Tuesday. Unfortunately we found that only 5/10 (roughly) tacos were actually discounted and the discount was only about $1 off each taco. With that said, tacos were very flavorful. I got the Carnitas Tacos which were filled with flavor. Haley got guacamole tacos which she enjoyed. We started with chips and guacamole which were good as well. For drinks, we both got margaritas. Mine was on the heavy side, didn't care too much for it (seeing that it was $11 was a downside as well). Overall, been to this restaurant multiple times and will go back. Next time, probably just stick with (and recommend) the beer.> 3.5 rating - Had dinner plans for my belated birthday with my best friend and stumbled upon this place after I found out my original pick was closed this week.  I was excited to try something new after deciding to go here as the next option because who doesn't love tacos?Walked into a beautiful restaurant with pretty hanging lights, a vibrant crowd, music and lots of smiling faces.  Large bar set up in the middle with tables on the sides and front.  Table for 2 was quick and easy at close to 7pm.Things you should know that I didn't..-If you go as a party of 2, go as a date because you will get squeezed inbetween first dates and overhear life introductions for the entire duration.  Seating is far enough for personal space but you can't unhear things either haha-Tuesdays is 1/2 price tacos.  Didn't realize until we saw a tiny slip of paper on the table to order oysters.  Check out the info and ask questions to get the scoop.  The scoop doesn't come to you.-If you don't drink, you have no reason to come.  Drive bys happen often here.  I wish I could have several shots of tequila and rack up a tab for you dear but I am breastfeeding an infant.  I only have 2 hours to snack for dinner, catch up with my best friend about life stuff, including life as a new mother of 2 with no time to herself, and run home to my husband who is watching 2 kiddos and waiting for me.. I am leaving soon right after this story............-The oysters were yum.  Try some.-I liked the baja fish taco the best.  Fried chicken was delish too.  -Fried chicken taco is spicy.  Don't say I didn't warn you.Overall, I recommend checking it out if you are in the area and want a drink and snack.  I need to get out more.  Maybe I picked the wrong spot and night out.> Loco deserves the hype it receives for being a great food and drink destination in an otherwise lacking part of Boston. The tacos are bomb, the oysters are delicious, and the margaritas have been solid. They also do chips and guac right, with healthy portions of each to share (one order filled two of us up comfortably). And, while it's not cheap, the menu won't break the bank, so it's a good option for a weekend or after work meal.So why four stars? The NOISE. It's so incredibly loud inside this restaurant. Add live music to the fray on the weekends, and you can barely hear the person across the table from you. I love the space, but wish they'd do more to separate the more energetic bar area from the sit-down diners.> Loco is a trendy taco joint serving up bites and drinks to the young professional crowd in Southie. If you walk in after work, or on weekends, you're likely to find a crowded establishment with well-dressed patrons set to the backdrop of twinkly lights, a wrap-around bar, wooden accents, and an oyster bar! I decided to be adventurous and order their coconut margarita. It had a coconut flake rim and was sweet and creamy. We also got chips and guac, which were solid but a little overpriced ($11). But, oh WOW. I ordered a veggie quesadilla with chicken added and it was probably the best quesadilla I've ever had. Flavor. Explosion. For those sour beer lovers out there, the Two Roads Lime Gose was also notable.","5, 4, 3, 4, 5"

I've been coming to this gem for years. Sahil and Tony on the bar make you feel like you are at home -- if your home was filled with amazing tapas (paella is also outrageously good) and a fully stocked bar with a creative drink menu. Every Monday night I ""work late"" and come to Estragon for 2 items off their tapas menu and 2(ish) grapefruit gimlets. This is also a great meeting spot no matter where in Boston you are -- the bar is typically full, but you can always get a seat with no more than a short wait in the main dining room. The ambiance is spot on as well. Its a fun quirky feel and I've gone here with a wide range of folks from my mom to client prospects. It's also a favorite for members of my team as we come here to celebrate wins or commiserate on the week. TLDR: Come here and embrace the atmosphere, be amazed by the food and prices, dabble in delicious drinks, and appreciate the best bar service in Boston I've ever had. BONUS: There is always ample parking right out front too.> This was place was pretty average for tapas. The food was pretty good, and there was a decently sized selection of food and drinks. For this price though, I think I can get dinner at a much nicer place with higher quality dishes. Dinner was about $300 for 4 people, and it was just the right amount of food. I think 2-3 tapas per person is enough, but of the dishes we ordered, nothing really stood out to me. Parking was surprisingly easy to find on a Saturday night. It's mostly metered parking, but there was plenty of space when we arrived. There were also quite a few empty tables when we got there too, but once it hit 8pm, the whole place was full. I would say this is a nice place to catch up over drinks and shared tapas, but nothing else really stands out to me. We did find our waiter to be pretty impressive. He didn't take any notes when we placed our order (10+ dishes and 2 drinks all at once), and he got almost everything right. The only thing he got wrong was the seafood paella he brought out, when we ordered the squid ink paella. Still pretty impressed!> Came here the other night for the tapas happy hour! (Tapas ranging from 2 to $5, Monday - Thursday from 5 pm to 7). They only offer this deal at the bar, which was full when we arrived, so we had to be pretty persistent and wait about 15 minutes before snagging a spot.Ambience is nice. Checkered floor, quirky furniture, varied seating, twinkly lights and book shelves! Service at the bar was quick and consistent. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. In general, the food was pretty good, but keep in mind that portions from the happy hour menu are quite small. (You'll need to order a lot!)The real stand-out dish for me was the chorizo, which was packed with flavor and tasted truly authentic. We wrapped up dinner with a chocolate olive oil mousse topped with maldon salt. Overall a solid experience!> Great food and amazing atmosphere. It will have you coming back for more! One of the better spanish restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in Boston. I enjoyed every single one of the tapas we ordered. From the mini meatballs to the shrimp to the roasted brussel sprouts, everything was delicious. I love it when restaurants know how to balance the flavors and the chef here knows what hes doing. The meatballs had a great texture and was on point. It wasn't overly salty and the sauce packed was ooof so good. Roasted brussel sprouts are one of my favorite things in the world and when pired with bacon it just blows me away everytime. I really enjoyed how it had a crispy bite on the outside from the char but soft on the inside. The extremely crispy bacon bits added that finishing touch. By far those 2 were my favorite of the night. Overall I would highly recommend you to come check out Estragon! You won't be disappointed.> Went here on a date for the happy hour menu and was not disappointed. Our favorite was the Huevo Roto ($5), which is a fried egg over salty, crunchy fries-- so good that we ended up ordering another. The Manchego y Jamon is good and great for the happy hour price ($2); I personally would skip the Patatas Alioli ($2), which is like a potato salad, but I don't really love potatoes all that much. The Mini Chorizo a La Cidra were great ($5), and we used the extra cider to dip the fries in...yum! The Coca Mini was good for the price ($5)-- a very small pizza with BBQ beef and parmesan. All of the above are happy hour prices and only available between 5-7 at the bar.The best part was that I had the best drink of my recent life, Delta Dawn, with bourbon, lemon, and peach. I wanted to order another but a) we didn't have time and b) it wasn't large for the price. Excited to go back!","5, 3, 4, 5, 5"
