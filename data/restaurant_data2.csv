The wait was short and I'm grateful that I didn't have a complete meltdown as the last time I was here it was with Terry and Little Bit =(This steak and cheese is divine, bread soft, the cheese gooey, steak seasoned just-so EVERYTHING is in balance. The bag was greasy so be mindful if you are taking it to go. It was a good nostalgic moment that I got to remember my Brother who used to come here with me when I was a little girl. Respectfully Reviewed> Delicious steak and cheese, nice staff, good atmosphere. Got the thee #1 with steak, sooooo good. Would recommend> I've been eating here since the early 1980's. I've tried steak and cheese sandwiches everywhere, including Philadelphia. NOBODY beats Joe's. The steak is fresh and shaved just right. One sandwich is a meal itself.Whenever I'm in Boston, it's my first stop. Straight from the airport and right up to Joe's. Try it and you'll see why so many people in Boston love Joe's Subs. Hands down. THE BEST!> I finally made it back home to my hometown in Boston. And yes the first place I went was Joe's Steak Sandwich. The good thing the steak sub still had that same taste it had when I was 13yrs old. The sad part the prices went up. But that's what happens. To my surprise Joe is still there and he remembered me by name . I was shocked. He showed love. Thanks Joe for the memories> Well, tried to order delivery from Uber eats or GrubHub and they don't deliver so I called the establishment to see if they knew anyone that delivered and as I was speaking to the gentleman he just hung up so I called back and he didn't speak English very well all I wanted to know was if I took a taxi there if I could take out dinner and he hung up on me again!   Since I'm from out of state and their menu looked really good I was excited to try this place but not so much now based on their customer service.","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

Friendly staff that also made sure to be precise on a mobile order. Lots of people can have the same name...so order # being correct is a must.> This place was just really kind of strange to be honest. I wasn't sure what the heck I was supposed to be building in a bowl, considering I had rice or lettuce, then all of a sudden an option for Mac and cheese in the mix. Then a choice of meat and tiny servings of sauce. I was like an odd ""choose your destiny"" kind of situation.Overall, service did go fast during peak lunch time. They had some chicken options and it wasn't overcooked and had some seasoning. Paired it with some rice, extra carbs on top of those and sweet potatoes. The Siracha sauce was a bit too odd for my but that garlic sauce was super good. (I think it was garlic) so give that one a go.This place was a bit too ""lets be kichy with farm fresh vegan yaya yada"" for my taste. But if you want a healthy option in the area and are into that calling your salad ""greens"" and are sick of Sweetgreen, then check it out. You won't be dissapointed at the end of the day and theres enough options that the bowl building is somewhat endless.> This place is wonderful. Everything in my bowl was wonderfully created and seasoned. I got the brown rice, kale Caesar, roasted carrots, and chicken thigh. Great portions for around $10 for an excellent balanced meal. The place is set up a little weird and indoor seating is small, but it's delicious.> Another restaurant within a four block radius that serves ""bowls"" of food.  Within these four blocks are two Sweet Greens, chipotle, and a Mediterranean, an Indian, and a Japanese place that all serve some form of a bowl with a base carb like rice with your choice of protein, greens, and dressing.  Their bowl is smaller than sweet greens, all the choices are healthy and they have some good protein choices.  I got the charred chicken thighs on faro with kale and broccoli.  All of the bowls in the area are priced around $11-13 with the exception chipotle which is the low price leader, but is also the lowest quality food of the bowl restaurants in the area.  I'll add diginn to the list of bowl restaurants that I visit every week.Update - went back for my second visit.  Suggestion to DigInn - I don't understand some of the sides and proteins.  I don't envision how I would put spicy meatballs on rice or faro, and then I don't envision myself ever adding mac and cheese as a side on top of a base carb.  Suggest that you create some pre-configured dishes built on the bases - similar to the way SweetGreens has some pre-configured bowls.","5, 5, 3, 5, 4"

Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Surprisingly it's usually packed out of the house in the evening but around noon you can slip in no problem.There's plenty of seating inside whether you're trying to sit at the bar and grab a drink or come in a group for a table. Lots of lighting and tv screens showing sports games throughout the day. It's a great setup honestly Kendall needed a place like this.I ordered the cornbread to start. It was phenomenal. Kind of squishy but soft, sweet and fresh. I low-key didn't want to share it but I split it with my group. Some of the best house cornbread I've had.As an entree I ordered the Chicken and waffles. To be honest despite the popularity of the combo I'm not the biggest fan of combining fried chicken (which I like) and house made waffles (which I like) into one dish. But I did it, and it was really good. The portions were huge so I didn't get to finish it. See the picture below.Those that I came with ordered the catfish sandwich, burger, and ranch fries. They all enjoyed the food they ordered and said great things.I noticed they have oysters and a large drink menu so as an oyster fiend I'm definitely going to have to come back for those.Overall great restaurant. Glad it's in Kendall and I'm excited for the next time I come to eat here.> Came in with my girl for $1 oysters 4-6 but they don't have that anymore. Awkwarrrrrrrrrd$2 an oyster f that we got the black pepper chicken wit ranch friesPlace is cool with parking in the front> This spot recently opened near my office, so my friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday. Overall, service could be a bit better, but the food was great!I had the timmy's tendies in original, with ranch. They were big breast pieces with a super crunchy exterior. I could see the salt on the breading but I felt they were missing a bit in the flavor department. Once dipped in the ranch, I didn't miss the seasoning though. The ranch fries on the side were delicious as were the homemade pickles. The slaw was also somewhat bland but it was light and actually a nice respite from the friedness of the chicken and fries.My friend had the Mr Henson sandwich that she really liked. By the end she had taken off the bread though -- the chicken is good enough by itself! When asked if she wanted fries with it she said yes (it wasn't clear that she was ordering a separate side of fries). Grapefruit soda was super tasty as well, and loved that they served with pellet ice.Would definitely come back with a fried chicken hankering.> Some of the better fried chicken in the area. Not Coast Cafe good but definitely worth a visit. And you can eat the chicken sitting down while it's hot, imagine.If only because for $20 the 4 piece tray comes with an entire half chicken. Large, succulent thigh, drumsticks, breast pieces arrive on a tray breaded well and fried perfectly. The skin is crisp and holds to the meat without separating with each bite. Available in regular, hot and honey black pepper, the tray is able to be had half and half, this time hot and honey black pepper. The heat level of the ""hot""  is definitely muted aNd barely noticeable. The honey black pepper is a stickier, fiery, better option.Pressure frying seems to be a method that brings great results in this case. All of the meat - including the thick breast - is juicy and moist. Practically gushing juices in some places. That's a win right there - moist fried chicken breast. Most likely helped by the buttermilk bribe but it is excellent chicken.The coleslaw is red cabbage and shredded carrot in vinaigrette with black pepper. Crisp, tart, cuts the chicken fat admirably.A fried chicken sandwich with pimentos only complaint is that the pimento is excessive.The service was a excellent.The space is beautiful - light, airy, expansive. Think huge plate glass windows, soaring steel beams and reclaimed wood. Somehow it feels comfortable despite being in the middle of an area of town that is mostly pavement, cement and tall office buildings.Great beers on tap - although not enough local microbrews. Full bar.Definitely on the return visit list.> Lily P's is a fairly new restaurant in the Kendall area that seems to be known for their fried chicken and oyster specials. I came for lunch so I opted on a fried chicken sandwich with  a side of mac & cheese rather than order one of the larger chicken platters. The fried chicken was good but next time I would skip the pimento cheese that comes with the sandwich. The mac and cheese decent but it could have used more seasoning. Overall good lunch option for the area with plenty of seating space for those packed weekday lunches.","4, 4, 4, 4, 3"

Went yesterday for the second time after my grilled cheese with turkey and avocado. This time had the porchetta, dear god, every mouthful was heaven. Next time will try the burger. You won't be disappointed!> I hate to do this as I was so excited a vegan option was added but... it's not good.My wrap was so, so oily, it was soaked through and I could only eat a few bites.  It was messy and there was puddle of oil at the bottom of the wrapper.  The flavor was just ok.I will add that the packaging/branding is very nice and staff is friendly, but overall this was a very disappointing experience.I am sad I wasted food and nearly $13 :(> Yummy new spot in the south end. The stand out item was definitely the Porchetta sandwich, with juicy meat and great flavors. The hot sauce was super fresh and such a good addition. The brisket was also good, but the meat was too fatty (even for brisket). The slaw on the brisket sandwich was a nice touch. There had been previous complaints of an automatic 20% tip being added, but that is no longer the case. The prices are a little high though, 2 sandwiches and a donut ended up costing $35. A good ""treat yo-self"" lunch spot!> Really solid spot - we tried four of their sandwiches recently.  Clear favorite was the ""Gobbler"" (turkey, gravy, cran deliciousness) with the falafel a close second (only complaint is that the falafel is so huge some of your bites are just pure falafel - they'd benefit from cutting it in half to distribute).  Brisket had potential (the pimento goat cheese was really nice), but the brisket itself was a bit dry.  We all felt the porchetta was the weakest - I found the garlic rabe super bitter and overpowering.  Will return to try the others, though it will be hard to stray from the Gobbler and Falafel duo - really great stuff.> Sally's Sandwiches is soooo yummy, what a wonderful addition to the Gallows Group empire! Despite the 99-degree heat, we made the walk out to this little doughnut/sandwich shop and we didn't regret it. The porchetta ($13) was juicy and rich, but contrasted nicely with the greens and the aioli. The bun was soft and fluffy. Great sandwich. The falafel was also excellent -- packed with flavor. Both sandwiches were reasonable in size -- not massive but a responsible amount of food. Or maybe I just thought it was responsible because it was so delicious I invariably wanted more. I would be remiss to not mention that the vegan peach jam doughnut was lovely as well -- soft and bursting with tangy peach jam.Wish I lived closer so I could get breakfast, lunch, and dessert at Sally's/Blackbird every day!","5, 1, 4, 4, 5"

When we got there, we loved the atmosphere and the drinks and the waitresses were great. We got the Ceviche, grilled octopus, Indian lamb and risotto. To be honest all were solid not fantastic. We finished with the banana bread dessert which was great, but the real issues didn't begin until we got home.As soon as we got home something was up with my stomach, but it wasn't until I was woken up at 3 am nauseous that I knew something was wrong. I had to rush to the bathroom the vomit and basically stayed in there until 6 am. My girlfriend herself had similar symptoms and actually had to call out of work the next day. We split everything, so it's hard to nail down exactly what the cause was but my guess would be the ceviche or the octopus which was a bit slimy on the inside. If the food was over the top great, I'd probably give them a second chance but after seeing the reviews of others getting sick from their seafood I would recommend avoiding this place totally. If you can't prepare seafood correctly don't serve it.> I absolutely love this restaurant.  My only complain about this place is the service.. specially at the bar. Anyway here my absolute favorite dishes: - Cuban Cigar: Absolutely delicious!  - Grilled Skirt Steak - Magical! You will 100% order a second. - Jalapeños Rellenos: Only get this if you for real, can handle spicy. This is very very spicy; drinking snack. - Polvo a Lagareiro - Yes, they also make really good Octopus! & my favorite cocktail is of course Once Upon A Time in Mexico.> Friday night 6:30 P.M. there were no empty tables so make your reservation! It was dimly lit so could be a nice spot for a romantic evening, if you're into screaming at each other because it's so loud.The concept of this restaurant is unique. Everything ordered come in small share plates (like tapas, but in the menu it literally says don't call them tapas lol) and it has foods that are widely known in different countries. Spain, Russia, Italy, Portugal, and France are just some of the options on the menu. So if you ask your girlfriend what she wants to eat and she says I don't know, take her here.The food was good. I just wished they seasoned more. Other than that had a good time.> Cuchi Cuchi has some very unique decor (""I expect nothing less from Cambridge,"" my friend said) which may or may not be your thing. But what will probably be to your liking is the food. My friend and I got 4 tapas (or ""international small plates"" as they call them ) and we were impressed with most of them. In fact, I was so satisfied with the scallops provencal that I would definitely consider coming back in the future .The 4 tapas we got were:- Scallops Provençal: scallops were cooked perfectly and whatever mushroom thing they had underneath it (reminds me most of stuffing) was delicious too. Word of advice, try to limit the lemon juice to the scallops as it can overpower the flavors of the mushroom stuffing imo. Random but I also found that the presentation of this dish with the seaweed is not exactly the most appetizing; I would stick with just the shell if I were the chef.- Tsukune: these chicken meatballs definitely had somenice Japanese flavors to them (there's a soy-mirin coating similar to a Japanese Hamburg). The avocado crema wasn't really noticeable on first bite but I guess it fit. The watermelon rind was pretty disgusting tbh. Next time I'll just pretend it's just for presentation purposes like the seaweed from the last dish.- Brie en croute: apples and walnuts were nice. Puff pastry and brie were delicious. Biggest surprise was whatever bacon jam was with the cheese in the puff pastry. It was flavorful and complemented everything nicely. - Chicken Kiev: don't have much of a reference point for this since I've never had chicken Kiev before but this was probably the most disappointing dish. The mushroom and spinach were fine (probably cuz of the herb butter) but the chicken lacked flavor.All in all, a pretty good dining experience and I was happy with the variety of tapas options. I actually think 3 dishes would have been fine for my friend and I (she doesn't eat much and I had a big lunch) so I wouldn't necessarily commit to the two tapas dishes they recommend per person.","5, 5, 1, 4, 4"

It's a small shop frequented by locals and other visitors. Everything is made fresh and packed on the spot after you order.   The top three items I like getting there are: 1) the cold cut banh mi sandwich 2) Thit nuong- the rice noodles with various sausages and cold cut meats 3) pandan jelly (sold in the mini styrofoam tray) in front of the food counterAside from the prepared foods, there are so many other desserts and snacks you can find around the shop. Depending on what time you go, sometimes there is a long wait. The line wraps around the food and goodies so you have time to browse and check out their selection :)> I would give this place 6/5 stars if I could - SO GOOD. Hands down, the best banh mi I have ever had in my life. I ordered the BBQ beef banh mi ($5.49) and a lychee smoothie ($3.99) thru uber eats ($1.99 delivery fee), and wished I had ordered another one. Prices are unbelievable for what you get, and the taste is unbeatable. The bread was crispy the way a baguette should be (should make a mess when you bite in, and this one def did), and the fillings (adequate amount of BBQ beef, cilantro, carrots, jalapeños that add a kick, pickled daikon) brought joy to my day. The lychee smoothie was sweet (can add boba, coffee jelly, or rainbow jelly to the smoothies at additional price), but not overly sweet, with a strong lychee taste.I will definitely order again and try other menu items!!> I came here after going to the JFK museum, and this was maybe a 30 minute walk away. The store has a lot of different food items pretty much everywhere: on the right I remember seeing dessert and drinks, on a table in the middle there were groceries, on the right there were pastries, and a place to order drinks, and in the back, a hot food bar and cashier. There were a few people (white people) who I stood in line with at the hot food counter, until being told by someone else in line that, if we wanted to order sandwiches, we had to go straight to the cashier. Keep that in mind if it's your first time here!I got the specialty banh mi and an avocado smoothie with boba. The banh mi came out super quickly, and although I waited maybe 15 minutes to eat it, it was super crispy, the vegetables were super fresh, and the meat (I don't remember what it was) was delicious as well. It was very cheap and filling too. Super good and definitely worth the walk.The avocado smoothie was also really good, and I don't know why it's so rare to find them on the east coast. The boba was soft and very sweet. However, and this might just be because avocadoes grow in Hawaii, where I usually drink my avocado smoothies, I think the smoothie with boba was like $5, which is twice what I'd usually pay, and also more than the price of like Jamba Juice and other overpriced chains. Maybe avocadoes are just more expensive in New England? Very good and comforting taste, but it was on the smaller side and kind of expensive.> I've had Banh Mi all across America and this one is definitely one of the top. The ingredients and the bread  is so fresh. I ordered the grilled BBQ beef option and I'm glad I did because apparently it's their best option. The portion size and flavor were both good for a $5 price.I also ordered the Thai tea, the tea is more on the not-sweet side but it's still refreshing. I'm also super excited to try their sugar cane juice. You have to find street parking to go here. The employees are nice but speak limited English so use hand gestures and speak clearly. They have good variety of both food and drinks. They prefer to not use AMEX cards because of the service fee but they can do it if that's all you have. There's no bathroom and no seating. This is a buy and go operation.> Part fast-food take out, part cafe, part grocery store with prepared foods. This place has it all!I came for the Vietnamese iced coffee (only $3.50, cash only) and left wishing that I ordered 2 more. Oh, and I also told my boyfriend to order me a spring roll and summer roll (both rolls come with 3 in an order). He ordered a banh mi sandwich and it was prepared so quickly and stuffed with meat and all the toppings. I was pretty jealous of his sandwich and regretting purchasing a bagel at another place.I really wanted to get the coffee again before we left Dorchester/Boston, but sadly never got the chance. Luckily 2 sets of friends live in this area so I imagine I will make this a must-stop place when I'm back in town!","5, 5, 5, 4, 5"

The amount of food you get on a $10 curry special is staggering.Can't speak as to the authenticity of the recipes, but it's all delicious. There's one specific reason I enjoy their food: they use substantially less butter than many Indian restaurants. Less butter and less dairy means their food is lower in fat, has a cleaner taste and is more digestible. I feel healthy when I leave here. Full, but healthy.> This place used to be good two years ago, but that's not the case anymore. I bought the following things:1. Samosa: Have had much better ones elsewhere.2. Chhole Bathure: Same as #1, oily, and the gravy was too liquid-y.3. Baingan Bharta: Seemed to have more onion than eggplant.4. Tamarind Sauce: Felt like water with tamarind. Worst of the four things.> Don't let the dingy, small space of the establishment fool you. The food is amazing and tastes/looks authentically so. Everything comes on metal food trays, and the portions are HUGE. I ordered the Chicken Bharta (under the Dhaba Specials), which comes with naan and rice. The naan is some of the best I've had. It's thicker than what I'm used to (definitely not complaining) and chewy. The chicken came with roasted eggplant, green peas, bell peppers, and just the right blend of spices without being too spicy. I may have to order to-go next time in order to avoid accidentally hitting more butts during my meal. But I think I've found the Indian restaurant I'll be going to for awhile, so worth it!> Food was definitely overhyped and the upstairs was a bit smelly and dirty with a few tables that were not cleared. Staff was friendly but that's about it.The chicken was not the best qualityMango lassie was a bit too tangyFood was cold thanks to the dish they serve it on and did not look that appetizing Overall a disappointment and would not recommendDefinitely overhyped on yelp.> Got takeout from Punjabi Dhaba last night and it was some of the most delicious and reasonably priced Indian food I've ever had. In the chicken tikka  masala, the chicken was moist and almost fell apart, as opposed to the dry cubes that are in the dish in many other restaurants. The mango lassi was intense in flavor, and the naan had a nice bready flavor (although it was a tad dry). To be able to get great tasting Indian food for less than $10 for many dishes is a total find. I will be back many times, and hopefully try dining in as well.","4, 3, 5, 5, 2"

Oliveira's offers cheaper food (29 for all you can eat or around 9 per pound of food compared to around 50 at an upscale place). The meat itself is comparable. Olveira's seemed like it offers more variety as well. They have hot dishes such as beef stew with yuca and fish. Also included are a salad bar (included) and dessert section which is a la carte. The brigadeiros, cold chocolate and evaporated milk balls, are good, but over sweet. I also appreciated how you go to the churrasco area instead of them bringing it to you. Many times at Fogo or Texas de Brazil I had to aggressively wave down the meat people. One thing that is different is location. The area was cramped and the furniture looked old and slightly dirty. Also, some of the hot dishes were cold by the time I ate them.> not bad just really expensive i got rice and beans with 1 small piece of chicken it was almost 17 dollars that i could not understand> This is my favorite loxation out of this local chain of brazilian chusquerias.

I go to thd East Boston one. It was good food , but my last visita have been bad experience. The food is old (soggy potatoes that feel more than a day old, the meat is either raw or too cooked, the yellow plantains also old) . The place is mostly empty, looks like people have been avoiding the place and they still want to make a profit by reheating food. I asked to speak with the manager to give feed back.

It's truly a neighborhood restaurant that stands out from so many others in terms of friendliness, quality, and service. I am a huge fan.> The restaurant as such is good -friendly and helpful staff, quick cooking, reasonable prices, and quiet environment. I have been there twice and both times were completely satisfied. I specifically like Placinta cu Brinza si Verdeata (traditional pan fried pie with cow cheese and herbs) and Friptura de Miel (Roasted lamb, stewed in special wine and rosemary sauce, served with roasted vegetables).The only thing I really missed was ""Buket Moldavii"", very famous sweet vermouth style wine. It is most likely not imported to the States but I wish it were.Before going to the restaurant you may want to check Groupon, they sometimes have ones like $24 for $40 I used last time.And just FYI, if you have never had a chance to try Moldavian cuisine - it is sort of country style, rather nutritious than delicious, rather fresh than spicy, and rather affordable than fashion.> First time trying out some modern European cuisine!  (Also super glad they had photos because some of these menu items were quite a feat to pronounce...)Some items that I ordered:1) PLĂCINTĂ CU BRÎNZĂ I VERDEAĂ - $10 as of 7/2019Essentially pan fried bread sandwiched in between cow cheese.  Not bad but nothing mind blowing2) KEBAB DE MIEL - $24 as of 7/2019The lamb kebobs were fantastically flavored and very tender.  It didn't have a gamy taste at all and paired superbly with the potatoes and the hot sauce (make sure to ask for more since it really adds to the dish!)3) CUMA LUI GUGUĂ - $10 These sour cherry crepes were quite tasty.  Not overly sweet and a great palate cleanser.4)  Opera Cake - ~$10?  (It was a special and I forgot the price).A richly flavored chocolate cake.  It is a bit dense though so be mindful when cutting into it.> Wow! So good! Food tasted very fresh, prepared and served perfectly. Neither I nor my friend were familiar with the cuisine, so the flavors were new to us, and were a delight to discover. Service was attentive, atmosphere comfortable. Highly recommend.> I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could. The ambiance of this place was strange. Glowing reviews and I assume it's for the food which was pretty good but man was the service bad. It's sad because service can really make or break a meal. The waitress looked like she hated her life the whole time. Rarely came back to check on us when we wanted to order more. We were also very thirsty throughout the whole meal, asked for water about three different times and didn't get any more water until she got us the check. Earlier we inquired about the ingredients of the pumpkin dish but the waitress ordered it for us anyway which was strange. Either way I will say the food was nice. I particularly enjoyed the chicken sausage and the traditional pie with cow cheese! I just don't know if I'd come all the way back to Newton for the experience as the food didn't outweigh the mediocre service.","5, 5, 4, 4, 3"

During the weekdays, there is a lunch special, 2 choices of meat with white rice and a house salad for just $9.95!I would recommend a reservation because you could end up waiting for over an hour!> I made a reservation for 6:30 PM and was not seated until 7:05 PM. Here how it played out. I checked in around 6:30 PM and the host told me they still need a few more minutes until my table was ready. My bf and I waited on the side, at 6:40 PM the host said my name in a whisper, then a couple who just walked through the door followed the host. I went up and asked if the host who checked me in called my name. She said, yes and said ""OMG she took the wrong people."" Then she told that host that she took the wrong people and the host who made the mistake didnt even look at me or apologize (she basically didnt care). Just a terrible host. How can she take a couple who did not even check in yet and her name was not even the same as mine? She cannot even say she made a mistake when I checked in with her face to face a few minutes ago?Food was good like always. Our waitress was very friendly and polite. We tried all the beef, pork belly, shrimp, and calamari. The calamari was a little slimy even after cooking... For veggies we went with mushroom and spinach. Everyone must try the spinach, it was surprisingly really good. For dessert, we got matcha ice-cream (incredible, really matcha-y), and smores.> I debated whether I should give Gyu-Kaku 3 or 4 stars. Settled on 3 stars because of a few things:This was my second time there and both experiences were pretty good. Ordered several small plates the first time and some tasted good while others were just ok. Did the BBQ the second time and went with the meat lovers option. The meat tasted great once we added some sauces. Did not like that the only dessert option was marshmallows for the BBQ. Wished they were kosher. Price is steep at $60 for two for the BBQ (with no beverage) but it's not a place I'd go more than once every couple of months. Service was ok. Pretty strict with accommodating substitutions. They pretty much said no to all requests. Even though we made reservations for early afternoon on a Saturday, we still had to wait 30 mins for a table. Parking is easy - there's the plaza lot and the free garage right there. Overall, a good experience.> This place is conveniently located right next to Saint Marys Street (green line).Upon arrival both the restaurant and the waiting area were packed so we could tell they're really popular. We heard a customer ask for wait time and it was over an hour, so definitely make a reservation ahead of time.Our reservation was for 6:45PM, but we arrived at 6:20PM and were seated within 15 minutes which allowed us time to peruse the menu. We also read their grill guide, but found it more convenient to just eyeball the meat to see when it's done.They have prix fixe courses and we opted for the $60 one (meal for two). It's also a great way to try out different meats - we ended up loving three and finding another three pretty meh, so now we'll know which type we're going to get in the future! The dipping sauce was amazing. We largely used the spicy sauce, which is what the server said is also the favorite for most customers.It ended up being way more food than we could finish so we definitely got our money's worth. Better yet, we downloaded their app which had a $10 off $30+ promotion going on for new users so we only ended up paying $50+tax.The service was great. Our server was super attentive despite how busy it was and came around to change our grill once it got charred. Only complaint was that the seats were quite old as our bench was pretty much tilted forward.> Wow the Brookline Gyu-Kaku for some reason or another is better than the Cambridge location. It's easier to hit up Gyu for lunch when the prices are cheaper (always a win) compared to dinner service. I also have never had issues walking in for lunch whereas if you plan to get dinner, you better have a reservation because the wait is always at least 90 minutes if you try to walk in.Try anything in their Shio White Soy sauce, I assure you it'll be unreal and of course load up on that Spicy Pork (between The Boy and I we at minimum get 3 orders). Round out your meal with some Spinach Garlic and Buttered Corn! I've also tried their seasonal chilled ramen, spicy chilled cucumbers, & shishito peppers. Great add-ons to your bbq. Pass on their Spicy Kalbi soup, it's a thin broth light on meat and veggies.","5, 2, 3, 5, 4"

Love the decor and almost has a divey feel to it. Haven't tried the food yet although doesn't look like a place where you'll go to grab a bite.> I am a regular at this establishment. Being a transplant from Miami, I absolutely love the old decor of the pub and the fact that it is walking distance from where I live. Paul, Johnny, Bob, and Ben all keep the beer flowing as well as the conversation, which is why I wanted to take my girlfriend and a good friend of mine there yesterday. Since it was a busy Saturday, we waited at the bar for a table to open up and took a seat about an hour after being there. This is where everything got bad real quick:We closed our tab and sat at the table, thinking we would be helped by the server I saw walk passed me about a hundred times (as well as rudely bump into me a thousand times without apologizing once) but, after about 45 minutes of sitting patiently, I noticed the server (now I know their name is Carry, Carrie, or Kerry, who cares) was only walking up and down the narrow bar in order to get to the front door to leave and smoke cigarettes. I counted about 5 times within the 2 hours I was there, and these were not quick cigarettes, usually a really nice session. In order to paint even more of a portrait of the amazing service we received, our favorite server (Carry, -arrie, -erry) at one point came up to our table (the first time they interacted with us) with two cold Guinness, asking if they were for us. You know you're not good at your job when your customers have to tell you to turn around and serve it to the couple that has been drinking the same beer all night in the corner of the restaurant. Of course, our server wouldn't know that because as they were outside puffing on tar sticks and making sure their shirt underneath their shirt was still cuffed properly, the bartenders had to get up from their post and do the servers job for them. Last but not least, Carry-arrie-erry, came to our table for the first and only time, asking ""are you waiting on me for anything?"" not ""can I help you? Sorry I haven't been around"" not ""Do you need a refill?"" which was a bad start. I bit my tongue and looked at my beer to see if I needed a refill and as I opened my mouth, I was interrupted and asked if I had a tab open at the bar, to which I said ""well yes"" to which they turned around and walked away. THE FUNNY THING IS I HAD TO REOPEN MY TAB BECAUSE I HAD NOT BEEN GREETED BY MY SERVER FOR OVER AN HOUR. I hope this wonderful server is reading this so they learn a lesson to treat every customer with the same amount of respect. I own two bars in one of the most popular areas in Miami, as well as an English degree, which makes me excellent at writing reviews for restaurants. If you do not want to treat people with an open heart in the hospitality industry (especially if they have done absolutely nothing to warrant disrespect, as we have all experienced rude customers before) then just don't work in hospitality. You are losing the bar money and doing nothing to help your own personal growth. Again, I love Sevens because it is my local pub, but it makes it near-impossible to go back on a busy night like that if all I'm going to get is a metaphorical face full of tobacco scented spit from my server and treated like a criminal for no reason. Quit smoking will ya.","4, 3, 5, 4, 1"

The atmosphere is bright and open with a lively yet chill ambiance. There is patio seating as well, which looked lovely! We were able snag a table for 6 on Saturday (the day of) but only because we were hotel guests. I was expecting extremely overpriced, mediocre hotel food but was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case! In terms of food, I ordered the Buddha bowl (with an egg) which I do NOT recommend. It was very small with only a few chickpeas and pretty flavorless. Also, it was not filling at all. However, everyone else in my party seemed to enjoy their food. I had a few bites of the outlook burger, which was delicious! The prices were decent, especially for a hotel restaurant.Overall, I would still return as I really liked the ambiance/service but I reccomend ordering anything other than the buddha bowl.> This is the downstairs restaurant associated with the Envoy hotel. I came here for breakfast and lunch while on a business trip. For  breakfast I got their lobster eggs Benedict. It was heavenly. They also had Earl gray tea which was a nice plus and the link sausages on the side were excellent. I couldn't really try their breakfast potatoes because there was so much food. They put a very generous helping of lobster and the eggs were cooked perfectly. For lunch I was eyeing their salmon platter but the hostess told me that it would take 15-20 mins to cook but the ahi tuna sandwich would come out much sooner. Since I was in a time crunch I got the ahi tuna sandwich. It was good as well, but a bit too heavy with bacon and the aoli sauce. The bread was toasted perfectly though, so no complaints.> Nice Decor, modern.  Not busy on a Sunday for brunch.  Live music (acoustic guitar).  Laid back.Cons:  Beer was served in a dirty glass.  this should never happen.  Staff needs to pay attention to detailPros:  the Outlook burger was very good, cooked as ordered.

I had a good experience coming here. the staff were friendly and helped me decide what to try and what toppings I wanted to get for my plant-based soft serve. The ice cream alternative was good but I do prefer the creaminess of good old fashion ice cream. I guess as a stand alone product it does satisfy the same cravings but it's quite expensive for the same amount of ice cream. I am hoping that these plant based option could be more of a fro-yo style pay by weight style service. The juices are good and I've had a couple fo the juices but Green#4 is my favorite. It took some time to get used to the taste but after a while it became my favorite.Overall, I am not too sure if I'd go to pressed juice on a daily basis. I found overall that their product and packaging is good but it's pricey and is more of a treat than a go to spot.> I am not really into juices, but I was really glad to give this place a try (thanks to yelp's check-in event!) I got a freeze ( a healthy alternative to ice cream) and a juice (citrus 2). I thought the freeze was just okay, but I have a huge sweet tooth so probably not that cut out for vegan ice cream. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my juice-- I found it to be really refreshing that I downed the whole thing in a few gulps!! If you are a health nut, I can see why you would love this place. They have a variety of options to satisfy all sorts of tastebuds! However, for people who are less inclined, I can see this place being a tad too expensive. But I do appreciate having this place as a healthier alternative to ice cream or smoothies/sugary drinks and my visit has made me more mindful of the ways that I can try to healthier!> Had a pleasant experience during one of the yelp events. Received a juice and a ice cream for free which is always lovely :) I had the green juice #4. It was very tasty. I love cayenne pepper in all my green juices to give it an extra kick. However, I don't love the fact that they are premade. I like my juices made fresh in front of me and being able to customize them. The ice cream was yummy for how healthy it was. I had the vanilla with chocolate drizzle, cookie crumble, chocolate chips. Definitely preferred it over halo or other healthy icecreams. They actually have a nice comparison chart on the wall comparing ingredients of theirs to other brands! Although my order was free, prices seemed fairly inexpensive compared to other juice bars.> Really friendly staff and a beautiful store! I love ice cream so I was skeptical at the idea of ""vegan"" ice cream but it was absolutely delicious (I got the chocolate/vanilla swirl) and I topped it with blueberries, granola, and raspberry drizzle.The juices are also great but I really only tried a couple. The Greens 3 was very drinkable and I definitely felt good afterward.The only thing I didn't love is that their membership was confusing. They seemed to tell me that there were no fees but that's only if you spend $10/month (which go towards items you buy there).","5, 3, 3, 4, 4"

However it is moreso they change certain items - not all! We got many many dishes and they were all pretty tasty. I would say the least favorite was the yuca fries. They have a bar to drink at and a kitchen bar to eat at. Despite liking all of that, I am giving it four stars because it is definitely not the quality of food I'd expect (a lot of it is frozen).

I could see how they were evoking breakfast flavors, while still keeping the Asian rice noodle with veggie base.The chile sauce on the side did a lot for it too. It was good, but very filling, and a tad greasy. It would be an awesome hangover food. Coffee wasn't great- so I would come caffeinated.> This place was recommended to me by 2 different people.

My usual go-to place is Chinatown cafe. However, I was closer to Wai Wai one day and decided to stop by.Very small restaurant hidden in a really dark side street. Their menu is on the counter. They have a few combos to choose from. The lady speaks enough English to understand your order. Their chicken and duck are really tender. LOVE the ginger scallion sauce they put on your rice. I could just eat rice with that sauce and be happy. The only down side I have is that they do not give you very much meat at all. And their prices are a little higher, over $8. However these prices are to be expected with the rent increases in Chinatown. Prices of food increase, but quantity and quality of food decrease. (Y'all can blame gentrification for that).> For all the hype, I wasn't impressed at all with this meal. We ordered two combo plates with duck, roast pork, bbq pork. Both plates were topped with the scallion sauce. The dish was extremely oily, the pieces of duck we were given barely had any meat so they were practically just duck bones, and the roast pork had basically no skin. The amount of meat given compared to the rice portion is so off. There are places in Chinatown and Quincy that I feel the quality is just as good if not better; better priced and with better selection of pieces. I would come back as it wasn't a bad meal, but would not choose this over other options of the same dish.> Hidden from the main streets of Chinatown, Wai Wai sits in the basement on Oxford street near several other smaller storefronts. It really is what you would think of when the words hole-in-a-wall comes up. Quick things to note: Cash only!With that aside, the thing that they seem to pride themselves over is their white-cut chicken (白切雞) as this is actually written on their store sign. This is something that I do not see as commonly served at restaurants around here, however, it is a very common way for my family and other Guangdong families to do so. The cooking method involves poaching the chicken whole in non-boiling water until it is fully cooked. It is usually shocked in cold water in order to firm up the skin. The resulting product is a tender, moist chicken with firm and bouncy skin without being overly oily. When ordering, you can choose from a variety of meats that they have over rice. The rice is drizzled with a seasoned soy sauce, then topped with the meat(s) of your choice, and that is topped with a ginger/scallion mixture. Keep in mind that the meats are cooled. When dining in, you also get a small bowl of soup which usually seems to be made from the leftover chicken necks and feet. Great simple broth that goes along well with the rice dishes. When craving a good plate of chicken and rice, this is definitely the one place that I'd like to come to for simple home-like cooking. Also remember, you can ask them to make items boneless if you like as well as white versus dark meat if you have a preference.> Been 20 years since I last eaten there & thankfully nothing changed. Table clothe are still dirty, cups & plates are still chipped, but the food still reigns supreme.  In town for few days & brought a few Bay Area friends to sample their famous wai wai chicken & it was very satisfying.We ordered the double treasure rice combo: wai wai chicken & roast pork over rice, it was fantastic! The roast pork was succulent, with right amount of fat & crispy skin. The finely sliced chicken was tender & has good natural flavor, skin & bones attached which is the appropriate Cantonese style. The ginger & scallion sauce on top was the perfect complement for the chicken. They also poured sauce (juices from the meat?) over the rice and it was heavenly. Even for someone from the Bay Area it's rare to have such fresh chicken, the owner chef has been here for nearly 40 years & they have not changed their method: use only freshly ""prepared"" chickens, this is not your frozen KFC or chick-a-filet. Overall Wai Wai is one of a few dying gems in Chinatown. The owner hinted he will retire in the next few years, hopefully it will still be here next time I m in Boston.> At first glance, this place looks sketchy, dirty, and you're unsure if you're there to buy food or accidentally walked into someone's home,  welcome to waiwai. This is the classic ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" situation. I've visited this establishment multiple times whenever I'm home sick. Their 三寶飯 (three treasure rice?) is my go to choice there, don't think I've tried anything else. From middle school to now i noticed their quality slowly go down, same great taste but meat to rice ratio was off. Maybe it's due to the location as Chinatown rent is always increasing due to gentrification. I will continue coming here when I have a craving for it.","4, 3, 5, 4, 3"

Even though I went on a rainy and gloomy day in October, we had a great server and great food. If you're going on a nice sunny day the view would be beautiful as it is right by the water. The lobster roll was great and so were the fries. I love lobster and I love fries. Haha super tasty all around. The salad was okay-a dressing that I can't exactly describe but someone at my table enjoyed it so it never went to waste!They even have a private event room downstairs if youu decide to have a little party there or a bridal shower! Super cute and private. I would suggest street parking out in the maIn road as the parking there were pretty pricey.> I wouldn't say this is an easy location by car. We had a difficult time finding street parking. There are parking spots in front of the restaurant; however, they were all taken. My family and I came on a rainy day, though, the delicious food made up for the weather! We arrived before the kitchen opened, yet the host was able to seat us. I recommend making a reservation in advance because it gets busy rain or shine. Our service was fairly good, but you can tell he was a new hire and was his first shift. He forgot a couple drinks and orders, but that's okay! The menu was quite limited, although, a party of ten was 100% satisfied. Many of us ordered lobster rolls, burgers, clam chowder, oysters, mimosas and coffee.> I want to like Pier 6 so badly - that's most likely why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The location is beautiful, they have a free water shuttle that runs back and forth to their sister restaurant the reel house (in the summer) & the patio is beautiful. That said, the past 3 times I've been there the service has been horribly slow. On Sunday, January 12th 2020, it was 60+ degrees in Boston so we headed to pier 6 for lunch, only to be brought down by disappointment. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, totally fine! But during this time my father was at the bar trying to order drinks with little success. After 10 minutes we were brought to our table where we watched the waitresses VERY slowly walk around the restaurant & help other tables. Just to clarify, by ""very slowly"" I mean, mozy-ing (unsure if that is a word). After 20-ish minutes of no one visiting our table, not even popping over to say ""sorry, be with you in a minute"", we decided it was time to go, hungry & thirsty. (Ubered 1.2 miles to the Monument Restaurant & Tavern, in Charleston - great place!) Pier 6 is in such a great location & has such a stunning porch, they should have properly staffed the restaurant to accommodate the incredible weather... the 60+ degrees was the only thing Bostonians talked about the entire week!!!  Like I said, I really want to like Pier 6 but I will not be returning (which sucks).> A fancy place with fancy food and a fancy view.I came here for my birthday, and it did not disappoint. My order: 3 oysters, lobster roll, margarita.Oysters were yummy, and came with three varieties of toppings- vinegar type thing, cocktail sauce with extra horseradish, and lemon. Lobster roll came with fries- which were absolutely delicious- not greasy, yet maintained that crispy potato outside that we all yearn for in a fry. The roll was definitely good. Mostly claw meat, which I don't have a problem with- but for you, the reader, that might vary. It was basically lobster bits and melted butter- none of that mayo-stuffed lobster salad. The bread was also delicious- crispy and buttery. Drinks were delicious (13/14$) i had a cocktail with my oysters called the pink drink- tasted like boozy lemonade- delicious with oysters.Second drink was a frozen margarita- also good.The view is what makes this place special. It is located right on Pier 6, and has panoramic views of the harbour and the city. I strongly recommend reservation.Wait staff was lovely.I am also adding pics of my friend's' orders- they were all satisfied with their meals> Ambiance was great, service was good, food was not enjoyable. From the drinks we ordered (all overly sweet) to the dry waaay over salted ravioli (also cost over 20 dollars), we left underwhelmed. Come for the amazing views and good service but don't have high expectations in the other departments. We ordered a basket of fries to start, crispy and cooked well. After that, we order the avocado toast (tasted like it was drenched in olive oil), salmon (best dish but still MEH), butternut squash ravioli (over priced/over seasoned/undercooked) and the beet salad (seriously bad and very strange). I would not recommend this place for a foodie but it's nice for a date where you are craving some quiet views of the city and want to enjoy it over a glass of wine! The food and drinks are way overpriced and you even need to pay for parking. I won't be back.","5, 5, 2, 5, 3"

It's on the side entrance of the Super 88 market. I've passed it a couple times, but finally decided to try it. I think this place is better than the Ganku Itteksu ramen place in Brookline because the broth is SO much more rich in flavor. I got the Kakara Men ramen on the menu, and it was probably one of the best bowls of ramen I've had. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the soft boiled egg was delicious and creamy and the broth was perfect. I am extremely happy to have found this place because it's so good and reasonably priced. The bowls ranged from $11-14 depending on what kind of ramen. The atmosphere: the place itself is quite small, it gives me a hole-in-the-wall vibe. The service was excellent and quick. The only thing I thought was weird was that they couldn't substitute different toppings although they were the same price...> This was the second time we came to this ramen shop. The first time we came here the menu was only 1 page front and back but now they offer more options to choose from. The staff are very attentive and nice. Food comes out fairly quickly and hot. Over all, a good spot to get ramen in the Allston area. -spicy chicken - the chicken here is so good, is well seasoned and fried perfectly. It's paired with a spicy mayo sauce that's a little more on the sweet side with a little citrusy taste- ika geso - fried octopus that aren't chewy at all. They are fried in a light batter and served with a side of lemon and mayo which-Isshindo ramen - my go to ramen choice here. Portions here are very filling. The egg tastes so good. The only thing I don't like is that they char the pork and it becomes a little dry -spicy paitan ramen - new ramen option. Pretty spicy and is served with fried chicken. Good combo but chicken does get soggy if you don't eat fast enough> Ganko Ittetsu's Tan Tan ramen is my personal favorite.  However, Isshindo's Tan Tan is a close second.  In fact Isshindo wins with the larger serving size, including a full egg (two halves).  Take note, Ganko Ittestu!  That being said, it was a packed house and everyone's soup looked great.  People were smiling and slurping away, luxuriating in their ramen umami on this raw and rainy February day. I struck up a conversation with the lovely couple next to me who ordered the spicy miso ramen and the spicy tonkatsu ramen.  They were regulars who ate there once a week who couldn't stop raving.  You know the ramen was great when you are sad to finish it.Isshindo is a worthy addition to Boston's ramen scene.> Great lunch place to stop by for a few minutes. We went here for a dinner from a friend's recommendation. The ambiance is quite uninviting. Many restaurants like this are tight but this one just felt extra claustrophobic, dated decorations, very uncomfortable chairs & tables, I really doubt anyone would choose to stay longer than 20 minutes. Not a big deal for a quick lunch, but for dinner, not off to a good start.We ordered a hot tea, their signature Isshindo ramen dish, and the miso ramen dish with chicken instead of pork. Let me say this first- prices are AMAZING, $11.50 for each bowl, (which really does fill you up)! However, you get what you pay for. Firstly, my hot tea is served in a plastic cup (which you would serve water or soda in) and it was one measly 10 cent paper teabag of some really cheap stuff. Slap in the face. The soup portions were really great, but it was just too simple. The flavors are all there, broth has amazing body, noodles great, pork was thick and juicy, but that's all you get. The most interesting thing on their signature dish was the egg, which stood out among the other flavors and brightened things up, but it's gone in 1-2 bites. To their credit, you can add other ingredients like extra egg, bamboo, etc... but don't you think at least their signature dish should be a display of their best culinary creativity + finesse? Why should it be up to the consumer to decide what toppings are NECESSARY to turn a good dish to a great dish? I would rather pay $15 and have a fantastic bowl than $11.50 and have it be ""almost-there.""Another small detail- they charged us $3 extra for the chicken substitute. Now, given that the prices are already so cheap, I would have been OK with this charge if they told us BEFOREHAND. However, we did not find out until the bill came. ouch.If I eat here again, it will likely be on a quick lunch break if I'm in the area. I think it will be an awesome spot for that application.> After hot yoga at the Corepower across the street, you might find yourself venturing over to Isshindo Ramen for a hot, steamy, and scrumdiddlyumptious bowl of ramen. This ramen promised land is conveniently located next to the Super88 Market and Kung Fu Tea with parking available for their customers. Upon arrival, as I was browsing the menu, I noticed many of the options contained pork broth, but have no fear there was couple vegetarian and chicken options- shout out to those with dietary restrictions! I ordered the Spicy Paitan Ramen- a six-hour chicken broth with onion, bamboo shoot, wood ear mushrooms, fried crispy chicken & soy egg. This was a meal that I can compare to ambrosia, the food of the gods. I'd highly recommend it to anyone! Now, I completely understand why this restaurant has such great Yelp reviews.","5, 4, 4, 3, 5"

The fried chicken sandwich is one of the best I've found in Boston and the fresh cut French fries are Also definitely worthy of checkin out:Mac & Cheese, Smoked Chicken, Pulled Pork, Corn Bread & The Pretzel.> I've always had my eye out for M&M, and I finally got around to trying their bbq. I got the bone-in plate, which comes with a half rack of ribs, half chicken, baked beans and a corn muffin for $38. With a price like that, my expectations were high.Ribs: They tasted fine, but were really tough and didn't have a lot of meat on them compared to other spare ribs I've had. I'm hoping I just got a bad batch. This was a huge letdown, as this is mainly what I was interested in and supposedly what they're known for. Chicken: Good. Some parts were dry, but overall satisfying.Beans: Amazing. Not sure what they put in these things but they're incredible.Corn bread (muffin): Standard. Nothing to write home about.Overall it wasn't what I was expecting but I would certainly be willing to give them another shot when COVID is over and I can go eat/drink at the new location.> Had a not so good experience at M&M BBQ on Saturday night at Dorchester Brewing Company. Restaurant not too busy, despite brewery filled to capacity. First problem, at the order counter we had issues with an extremely unfriendly and unhelpful server / order taker. We had questions on substitutions / adds, she doesn't answer the question but instead starts typing in the order into her system. When the sandwich (which was replacing meat for a veggie option, which should be an even substitute if not less) increased in price from $11 to $17, we were surprised and questioned why that was and if it was a mistake. The answer we received was ""that's just how we do it."" Extremely unhelpful and rude. Next, as I mentioned the restaurant had plenty of workers and wasn't extremely busy. Our orders took 20-25 minutes to come out, which was unfortunate as we were hungry and wanted to eat quickly. Food was fine when it finally came, nothing special. We already had a bad taste in our mouth after the wait and rude service that we weren't necessarily excited to get the food. 2/5 overall, likely would not go back and/or recommend.> It was bittersweet when Dorchester Brewing Co. remodeled and integrated M&M bbq. Bitter because we could no longer BYOF. Sweet because the food is good! I would say the bbq chicken is pretty dry but the sauce is delish as are the sides we got and the dumpster fries. Portions are large and this heavy food goes perfectly with the more bitter, sour beers on tap at the brewery.> Nice addition to Dorchester Brewing- who doesn't want some easily-accessible and tasty BBQ with their beer?We were there the day before their grand opening, so they didn't quite have their systems or timing worked out perfectly yet and the ordering and wait time were a bit muddled- but that will likely improve with time. The pulled pork sandwich had little sauce (just a bit brushed on the potato bun, I think) but still managed to be pretty flavorful and not dry- I did detect a bit of a kick (cayenne?), so it's not 100% mild FYI (I personally prefer my BBQ heat from mustard instead, but to each his own). The fried chicken thigh sandwich was crispy but juicy and also flavorful, topped with some tasty pickles, and was the clear crowd favorite in our group. The skin-on fries have potential, but were a bit soggy and cold by the time they got to us (although probably are excellent when fresh), and instead of ketchup they give you BBQ sauce to dip them in. I recall from trying them at a past Beer & BBQ fest that their ribs are good, but they were out when we were there.Prices are good for sandos, portions are sufficient without being too overwhelming or too tiny, access is easy (don't even have to step outside). I bet they'll do very well as part of the brewery- beer and BBQ is an excellent match.","5, 3, 2, 4, 4"

You can ask to substitute the Cole slaw for toast or another Canes sauce.They offer the usual drinks as well as unsweet or sweet iced tea which are so good.The hours here change based on the times of the nearby university so check to see if they're open at 9 PM or until 12 AM.The staff are very friendly. We come a couple times a month and it never disappoints!> I was looking forward to this place for months. Passing by it on the B line each time and envisioning some southern hospitality with carefully selected seasonings and batches of crispy chicken cooked to perfection. The advertising is just that - really good advertising to grab you in. I will admit, it's nice being able to order by the chicken finger. Usually I'd expect a 4-6 piece minimum. And, the portion they give you is well worth the size.Here are the downfalls. Let's first start with the fries. I call these the ""almost there fries"". They just needed to be crisped more for texture and taste. Doesn't help either when trying to dip them in ketchup and snap in half before I can reach the Heinz. It was also a little oily.As for the fingers/tenders (as initially I thought there would be bone in), it's too greasy. It's very similar to KFC. When I want tenders, I want that deep fried, feel it to the core chicken wholesomeness. The batter - while fried well - slips off the chicken too easily and you're left with just bare naked chicken. And the taste again is a bit oily. The chipotle sauce too had a bit of a kick but also was a let down. It's just another one of those ""fast food greasy establishments"". Sometimes for the food you want, you really have to go down to the part of the country the palate comes from. At least it was worth a shot and can say been there, done that.> I had been here once many years before when my son was interviewing with a out-of-state college rep at the coffee shop next door. As I recall, I enjoyed it and recommended it to my husband. I was at a BU theater production that was close by and just smelling this place while walking by brought back that first memory. After the show, the smell was too enticing and I just had to have some (maybe not having dinner had something to do with it too).The strips are tender and juicy. The fries are crispy and the toast is a weird choice but it works. The lemonade was pretty good as well - not too sweet. This is the definition of a guilty pleasure.> I'm clearly not understanding something. Came here for lunch with my boyfriend and got the 4 Finger Combo. It tasted...like chicken? I'd honestly rather have any other chicken place: Popeyes, Chik-Fil-A even. Nothing really popped out as a wow. The breading wasn't special tasting, and neither were the fries or the Texas Toast. I feel like I've had better frozen versions of both. Does that make me too trashy or too boujee for this place? What does it mean? T____T I personally won't be coming back, unless I wanted their sweet tea.> Especially for a hungry student on the go, this place is perfect for a filling, affordable comfort food meal. They fry the chicken to order so it comes out fresh, light and crispy. The skinny crinkle cut fries are amazing and impossible to stop eating. Oddly enough my favorite part was the buttered Texas toast. GUYS, IT WAS PERFECT. It's so thick that it's still so soft in the middle and generously buttered, and anyone who knows me knows I LOVE butter more than anything. Just incredible.The one thing I didn't love was the sauce. It wasn't flavorful and didn't add anything to the meal, I wish I had just gotten the honey mustard.It can get pretty busy around lunch time and after work, but they crank out your food very quickly.

The bento comes with a lot of food, so I was going to say it's really worth it.

I used to eat here in college and thought the sushi was good but my husband and I barely touched our food last night.The spicy seafood fried rice was absolutely terrible. The shrimp that came in it were the only edible thing. The scallops and other seafood mixed in were very chewy and just didn't taste good at all. The rice was very bland and unflavored. Very frustrating because it is expensive and sounded delicious when I ordered it.The sushi rolls were underwhelming and overpriced. I wouldn't recommend the fire maki.

The sauerkraut was like what you would get in Germany. The had a great beer selection on tap and in bottles and cans. I was imppressed that they had many of the different styles of German beers on tap including the expected Pilsner and Hefeweizen, but also koelsch (2types), a sour and a German IPA on tap. Good atmosphere as well (decor and utensils) and we had great service. I would recommend this place   highly to folks like me who lived in Germany and want to take a culinary walk down memory lane.> Go here for the beer list; stay for the food. In all honesty, having spent some time in Germany, this place is not super authentic - and that's okay! The beer menu is awesome - over 100 German, Austrian, and Polish brews, and a good amount are on draught. I personally enjoy the $7 ""mystery beer"" if I'm having a hard time choosing, and the liter of ""das boot"" of the house Weinstephaner is always fun. I love the glassware, it feels very European. The food is pretty good - but not as authentic as you might hope. We got the schnitzel and spaetzel and it was as others described in their reviews, a fusion of German and America fare. The ambiance is really cozy, the staff are friendly and attentive. Definitely a solid place to visit.> I've spent a little quality time in Germany... so let me tell you this: German food is nothing if not bold and heavy on the flavors. [Some] Germans refer to American beer as spülwasser (rinse water). I was able to try the charcuterie, sauerbraten, a piece of pierogi, the donut dessert, and Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche beer.About the charcuterie, these are some awesome sausages! Sure, they're only slices, but the flavor didn't go anywhere. The variety is good without being too overwhelming. Though I would have liked a bit more candied bacon, then again, I love candied bacon! The sauerbraten was, well, ""Sauer"" but still good. The meat was very tender, cooked perfectly, and full of bold flavors from the braising. The black cherry bbq sauce was in the perfect amount, and while I personally would have liked a little less sour, who am I kidding, I knew what I signed up for. The halusky potato pasta was good and did its role of adding a starch element to the dish. What was sorely missing was a fresh element to balance out the rather heavy meats, fats, and starches.The bite I had of my friend's veggie pierogi was good! Cooked nicely with great flavors. The donuts were good! Not something you get at Dunkies, but a more fork and knife based dessert. I also opted for the chocolate topping, since, well, it's hard to say no to chocolate. Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche beer: great stuff! Not too heavy, but oh so amazingly smokey. It's a good thing I didn't get a second bottle though, for it was bloody expensive!That's my only real gripe. The food was certainly great, but it felt a little heavy on the wallet. The beer, as an example: I fully understand that restaurants can't sell at cost, but a ~$5-6 beer selling for $17, that's a bit steep. The service was very nice and polite, and the location was clean (and had a cool vibe!)> Food was decent. Pierogi's kind of tasted like a super doughy Americanized empanada. 2 huge empanadas-sorry, pierogis-were 21 dollars. Soft pretzel appetizer was excellent but the mustard it came with was SO spicy it was virtually inedible. Cheese dipping sauce was good, but a bit curdled and separated. Drinks were good. Beer flight was very good. Burger was probably an 8 out of 10. Server was grouchy and annoyed. Not very pleasant, but I do understand we were a party of 4 that hasn't seen each other in a while and we were probably tough to interact with. Nonetheless, her attitude was unpleasant. Really cool medieval German/polish ambiance. I think the ambiance is the coolest part of this establishment. It's definitely a ""wow"" factor. You walk in and kind of gasp at how cool all the velvet chairs and lighting is. Dinner for 4 came to about 200 dollars before tip. 50/50 shot of returning.> The ambience of the restaurant was definitely very German, from the type of furniture, to the choice of décor. It definitely adds to the whole German food experience. The restaurant isn't huge, but there were a lot of people in there! Definitely make a reservation advance before going, as I can see the wait being pretty long. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered, especially the charcuterie plate and the spätzle. Bronwyn's charcuterie plate with items such as fried beef tongue and rabbit liver mousse is definitely for those who are adventurous. I strongly recommend the charcuterie plate as the items are very unique and were all delicious! I was very satisfied with my spätzle as it was fragrant with the smell of shallots and extremely cheesy, just the way I like it! Someone ordered the Wurst Trio and I kept stealing her potatoes as they had a very crisp exterior with a soft tender center, it was also very fragrant (probably cooked with animal fat!).Overall, a great experience with delicious food and cheerful service.","5, 4, 4, 3, 4"

I love supporting neighborhood places anyway, but the quality, price, and experience here are all excellent and worth the trek even if you're not nearby.  I also love that it's rare not to see the owner Jason around, greeting guests and helping front of house out wherever he can- clearly he cares about his restaurant and his patrons, and it shows. This is a place you definitely want to add to your rotation.> We were told that we did not need to say we wanted our scotch neat, but no one trusted it (I checked with whisky loving friends later and we all agreed that I will say neat so as to not ruin anything you order). Of course, a great selection. I ended up getting the vegetarian curry and, while thinking there was no way I would eat all of it, I did because it was so damn good. We also had some mini veggie pies to start which were also really good. However, I'm never sure the price is worth it here, which is why I don't go as much as my stomach might want.> Both the pros and the cons of cozy - but with good food to boot! We came in with a reservation and had to wait a little while - and there really isn't anywhere to wait. The bar was packed and I could tell we were driving the servers nuts, but it was freezing so didn't really see any alternatives.Once we sat, we had a great experience. The food was really good, and service was great too. I wouldn't normally have picked the scallops, but I saw someone eating them at the bar - and they were so good! Everyone around me was happy too though, so I doubt you can make a mistake here.> I can not wait until I can go back to this establishment- the food is soooo delicious- best burger ever and the fish and chips is the best I've had. And Scotch! Scotch!> If you're in Jamaica Plain, and it's a little late...you're not really in the mood to eat a filling meal but you want to munch on SOMETHING. A little greasy, a lotta satisfying -- get yourself into Haven and order a side of their steak fries and wash it down with one of their Irish beers on draft. The ketchup is made in-house too. Super tasty. I've also had the burger here, which has been recognized before as one of the best burgers in Boston. It's simple, juicy and full of beefy goodness. The rest of the menu was intriguing too. There were plenty of dishes on the menu that included only what I imagine to be authentic Irish comfort food. Irish I tried other things as well, but alas, my wallet cries 'no'.","5, 4, 4, 4, 5"

Think of it as Mediterranean food gone ""chipotle style.""Walked in and they weren't busy. We were helped out right away. My friend and I both ordered a plate each. His plate was pork with tzatziki sauce, along with fries on top. This also consisted of onions and tomato. I ordered a grilled chicken plate with lemon yogurt, and with fries on top. The fries had feta cheese crumbled on top as well. It was also accompanied by tomato and onions. Delicious! The foood was delicious! He paid about $37 for two plates and two drinks. The employees were all friendly and the inside was super clean.. We were even offered some free dessert... couldn't say no and so happy I accepted the offer. We were given chocolate covered loukoumades and omggggg heaven right there.... Ohhh guys please come to arizonaaaaa!> Haley wanted to order from GreCo, don't each much Greek food but gave it a try anyways! We ordered delivery, arrived in Southie super quickly from the seaport. I ordered a chicken Greco classic, which came with chicken / onions / hand cut potatoes. Surprisingly the combination worked, very tasty on a nice flatbread pita. Tastes were solid, flatbread held together extremely well, and was a great portion. Also ordered a side of fries, very good as well. Haley also enjoyed her sandwich and ordered a salad to eat later on as well. Overall, enjoyed the food and would order again. Probably would need to be in the mood for Greek to order again, couldn't eat everyday. 4/5!> The Classic Pork Gyro is better than the lamb.  As far as the Dips with Pita, the charred eggplant is the best as well as the Tzatziki (skip the Spicy Feta, Greek Fava and Pepper Paprika).  The Pea Protein Keftedes are fine.  I was not a huge fan of the zucchini chips; nothing wrong with them they just didn't wow me like some other reviews suggested. The Bougatsa Loukoumas doughnut holes are also pretty tasty.> Excellent food with excellent service. This is such a great option for a fast casual meal in the seaport ! All of Demetri's restaurants are out of this world - the flavors the vibe and the experience!> I am obsessed!I stopped by at lunchtime, and the line was wrapped around, but they are a well oiled machine and moved the line so quickly. I ordered the Mediterranean salad with spicy feta and chicken, and it blew me away. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The quality was something I would expect from a sit down restaurant. The workers were so friendly and happy, too, and their energy was contagious!Don't let a long line deter you if you're in the area. It'll go quick and is 100% worth the wait!","5, 4, 4, 5, 5"

This lobsTer roll with homemade slaw is enough to fall in love and never leave !! Delicious> Very sad. OK shrimp cocktail. Dry as a bone corn bread app. Weird rigatoni main with way too much tasteless braised beef.  I know many people might say that it's impossible to have too much braised beef. However, I shared my main with a foodie who also thought it was sub par. The mouse running around the tables was the last straw.> Just did a quick stop here to get out of the heat and snag a couple beers.  Very neat interior and an incredibly friendly and welcoming staff.  Our bartender was engaging and attentive and we really enjoyed our brief time here and everyone we interacted with...had the oysters and they were excellent.Will swing by for longer and more food in the future so stay tuned.> For a tavern, which I usually don't frequent, I love this place. Nice interior atmosphere with dark hardwood floors, black leather seats, dim lighting but not too dark, tall tables with prominent but not too big of a bar. Wherever I go, if I see sweet potato fries on the menu, I order them. These are the BEST I've had... maybe ever. Cut fresh and perfectly golden. An order is like 2-3 portions to me. Absolutely delicious at a decent price. Oh yes, and they have Bell's Oberon on draft!  I lived in Michigan and it's Michigan's best. I haven't seen it in a liquor store, let alone on draft, here in Boston. Definitely try out Granary. It's located on the Boston Greenway and has outdoor seating for the summer. High fives, Granary.> I went here for brunch and it was perfect! It's in a very central spot in the city of Boston, easy to get to! We got the corn beef hash, lobster eggs bene, French toast, and my person favorite shrimp cocktail! The service was very attentive and friendly. Their Irish coffee was delicious, just strong as a warning.","5, 2, 3, 5, 5"

My co-workers and I went to A&B Burgers on a weekday for lunch and the restaurant was packed. This could have contributed to why the wait for everything was slow from being seated, to putting in our orders to getting our food, check, and to-gos. However, if you have time on your band and you're not in a rush, the food and atmosphere is phenomenal. It should be a surprise that the restaurant is known for their burgers. One of my coworker boasted that A&B Burgers has the second best burgers in Boston. I was skeptical unit I bit into my Hangover Burger. And of course you don't need a hangover to try their Hangover Burger though you may need a place to have a nap after.The Hangover burger is loaded with breakfasty kind of goodness. Beef patty, fried egg, bacon and cheese. Did I leave out any ingredients? As if that's not enough to knock one out during lunchtime. The beef patty was juicy and the egg yolk will ooze out of the soft brioche buns. Then there was the truffle fries. Some of the best I have had. I recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. Great atmosphere and food for pre and post games outings.> Loud music, varies between quite a few styles.Food is ok.Don't order the ginger beer!! They charge you & don't take it off the bill for crappy tasting stuff. It's 96% of the ADV for sugar. 48g of sugar!!!I dislike that they didn't take the drink off the bill when I didn't like it after the first sip.I wasn't making a mule, just drinking it like a soda. Then, not refill to my soda I got afterward.Only good thing: open late for food.> So bad I don't want to waste too much time writing this review. Nothing was seasoned: burger, fried chicken, or fries. Medium rare burger was medium well. One of the employees was hostile and demeaning/cruel to a newer staff person right in front of us and other customers. Prices are exorbitant but the food wouldn't be any better even if it was cheaper.Absolutely unequivocally AVOID.> Wow- this place- best burgers of every kind !Turkey, veggie , beef- all made delicious The combination of flavor in each burger is enough to make me drive back the hour it takes to get there- I highly recommend the sweet potato fries The service is excellent- short wait time- the people are friendly and helpful. They make you feel at home. Will definitely come back again!!!> Went here tonight for the third time, tried some new things from the menu, and pleased as usual. We live in the neighborhood, and have a plethora of choices for dining out. A&B has a prime location for sunset views of the bridge from the patio, great servers (Danny is so much fun), friendly management (thanks, Austin), and some of the best wagyu beef burgers, fries, and accompaniments around. Tonight we took advantage of the summer special and enjoyed a bottle of Artemis for half-price (this made it less expensive than from the grocer) w/ our burgers. What a treat! We finished off the bottle with a brownie sundae- delicious. Great beer selection, too, if that's your thing.

The hostesses do a good job of managing the line that sometimes forms and make sure to get everyone seated quickly, single diner or large group. I'm a New Englander and always love legal. Their seafood is always great. I know it's a chain and there's plenty other seafood options (well, not in Logan but in general) but I always recommend legal. Today I went with a classic lobster roll with onion strings and coleslaw before my flight. Pricy for its small size at $35 but to be expected for lobster and Logan. I'll be back next time I fly out of Logan.> Good for a quick (not TOO quick though) bite when you're leaving from terminal A in logan. Main comment is that I didn't expect much but they surprised me. I say quick because my fastest time in and out was 16 minutes. Food is good for an airport restaurant as well, especially considering the speed at which they bring the food out. Lobster roll was surprising. Not the best I've had but it was good. They don't skimp on the meat. Not a huge fan of the crab cakes. A little mustard-y for my liking. Also not a fan of the hoisin salmon. Flavor combinations are a little weird. Too much sauce as well. The regular grilled salmon on the other hand was good. Basic flavors but liked the taste. Shrimp cocktail and oysters are alright if you're craving seafood before you leave Boston. Greek salad is quite large but good if you need some greens.> A must dine at place if streaming through Boston's Logan Airport across from A5 gate.Line moves quickly.  Kitchen is spot in cuz turnover is super quick and everything tastes delicious!Asked the hostess what she recommended and she said soicy fish and chips or crab cake combo.  I decided on her 2 nd suggestion.  Shared half with hubs plus ordered him a mug of clam chowder as he's a big boy...( in more ways then one, around the midsection I mean.)Couldn't resist the description of the BCP- what is it? I asked our server.  Good choice/ Boston Creme Pie which I also shared, 1/3 for me, 2/3 for hubs.  Light as air, just enough chocolate sauce and the crushed toffee bits, heavenlyOur server was so efficient, didn't have to ask for extra spoon or the check.  You won't regret dining here- very cool eatery.> I spent the day working in BOS and hadn't gotten a chance to get some clam chowder before I left the city. So when my coworkers informed me that there was a seafood place in Terminal A, I was thrilled!When I got a break, I went over to Legal Test Kitchen to get chowder and a salad. There was a line to dine-in as the restaurant was pretty crowded, but I'd planned to order to-go anyway. Luckily, there was a separate register for to-go orders and it wasn't long at all.I ordered my chowder and Caesar salad and the cashier recommended I get a salad from the to-go refrigerator while she poured me up some chowder from the warmer behind her. I paid about $19 for chowder, salad, and water...kinda expensive, but it's airport food, so it was expected.The lettuce in the salad was fresh, but the croutons had started to soften because the salads were pre-made and the croutons had been sitting on the lettuce. The chowder was delish and hit the spot! All it needed was salt and pepper, which I added. In the future, I'd probably just order a freshly-made salad, but overall, I was pleased.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

Yoma has the best coconut rice I've ever had, and having it with the Spice Mountain, the herby spicy flavors and the fragrant and fluffy coconut rice just makes the perfect sweet and savory and spicy combination. Yoma also has the best noodles. And I won't hesitate to order any noodle dish here honestly. I am making it a goal to try them all because they have such different takes on noodles. They have the rainbow noodles which literally mixes different types of noodles and create different textures. They always top it off with perfectly soft boiled eggs and the noodles are always cooked to perfection! I definitely recommend the Rangoon tea, take it hot with some milk in the winter and it the most heart warming drink! On a hotter day, try their traditional tea salad for a super light, and refreshing bite!> This place is a definition of a-hole-in-the-wall!I had this place bookmarked for 2 years now. And I am so glad we finally got to try it tonight! You can judge how good a Burmese restaurant is by their mohinga dish. Mohinga is a rice noodle and fish soup. Btw, mohinga is off the menu and probably the reason why it took me so long to visit this place! Their mohinga is out of this world! This is the best mohinga I've ever had, comparable to my mother in law's. Of course. Service was excellent. The owner is super sweet and attentive! Kimchi is the signature dish of korea; mohinga is the signature dish of Myanmar! You must try it!> Oh my gosh, so good! I haven't had Burmese food in a longggg time, and this was just how I remembered it. The Rangoon Iced Tea is really good, and tastes like a better Thai Tea. The limeaid is also very refreshing! Get the tea leaf salad! It's what they're known for, and the fermented tea leaves are super yummy. The crunch additions gives it a nice texture too.We also got the Coconut chicken noodles, which was perfect for a  cold day. The Spice Mountain Samosas, a baby samosa salad in broth, was my personal fave. You'd think the broth makes it soggy but it doesn't. It just adds so much more flavor!This is definitely one of my new favorites in boston!> Very friendly, attentive, service. I had so much complimentary tea :). When you check in with yelp, they give you a free milk tea. I'll save that for next time. Had their special pickled tea salad. The pickled tea has a different kind of flavor- it's good, mixed in with the salad. I liked the crunchy iceberg, tomatoes, corn, crunchy nuts and soy, and how it all came together. I think it may have had a squeeze of lime on top. Nice ambiance, with calming music, and artwork with scenes that definitely transport you to another place.> Hole in the wall Myanmar cuisine tucked in Allston and Brighton. We had the coconut curry noodle and mango salad - very hearty and delicious on a cold winter day. Service was also very thoughtful. If you check in to Yelp, you also get free milk tea !

The opening days and hours are very wonky, and the ordering experience and the physical space can be improved upon. This is not the best place to enjoy your meal, I recommend to go orders only.> This has to be one of the top roti shops in boston hands down, i love them. They would get 5 stars only if they made you roti in a timely fashion. The wait once you get there for your roti is insane and if you call it in they just move you to the head of the line once you get there instead of actually making it when you call.Great place, authentic food, amazing flavor, well worth it!Just takes a bit> Really like the roti here. If you are looking for some authentic Trinidadian roti this is the place to visit. I like the boneless chicken roti ($8.50). Very affordable and has a lot of flavor. They have other Trinidadian goodies that you can try. Everything seem reasonably priced. It gets pretty busy but service is fast. They have some seats inside but most people take their food to go.They are not open every day of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), you'll have to plan your visit around that.> Without a doubt, the best roti in Boston. I am always homesick and craving a roti, and recently heard about this place so I knew I had to try it. Although the wait was long, soca was blasting from a speaker so I had a good time waiting lol. And the wait was definitely worth it. Extremely authentic and tasty. I am ready to go back already!> Its getting a 4 because it's not open 6 or 7 days a week and the hours are weird.

Dumpling Cafe is my go to Chinese restaurant. As there are a couple restaurants known for soup dumplings in the Chinatown area, Dumpling Cafe has the shortest line as it is a hidden gem. The restaurant is slightly larger than any other restaurant in the area. I really enjoy their pork chops with peking sauce, peas pod stems with garlic, sauteed string beans, mini juicy buns with pork and roast beef with scallion pancake. Though, I would not recommend ordering take out at Dumpling Cafe because they do not double check their orders. During two separate occasions, they've packed an incorrect dish and/or forgot a dish. One incident, they gave me dumplings with mushrooms rather than soup dumplings. The second incident, they forgot an entree.> food: 7/10. good, not spectacular. price: 6/10. get a decent amount of food for a decent price. not the most affordable, but definitely a casual lunch place to go if you're in the city.service: 2/10. i'm disappointed to write a low review, but part of the restaurant experience is good customer service, and that was not provided here. maybe we caught them on a bad day, but our waitress was mean and accusative. she didn't take our order for about 20 minutes, and the joint was quite empty. the food was provided fast to make up for it. overall: 4/10. take out is probably a better option for this place!!> Ordered takeout from here one night when we were too lazy (and it was too cold) to go outside to eat. The food didn't take too long to come and the prices were reasonable, so no complaints there. One caveat here is this is of course takeout, so perhaps I might have enjoyed the food or the experience more if I had dined in. Hard to tell.We ordered the steamed beef and cabbage dumplings and the steamed seafood dumplings. The beef dumplings were juicy enough. The seafood dumplings were a bit bland, so I had to counter them with the dumpling sauce that came with it. The skin was disappointing; it was too thick and masked some of the flavor.I thought it was a mediocre meal and a quiet affair. It was what I asked for: my craving, dumplings, delivered within a reasonable time frame, without me having to pay too much for them. Three stars for a relatively safe, okay experience: did the job, but didn't blow me away.> In this new age of takeout and quarantine I wanted to start with supporting small businesses in the Chinatown area. We ordered Taiwanese dumplings, sesame chicken, shrimp fried rice and sautéed beef flat noodles. MY GOODNESS it was soooo good. The sesame chicken was so fresh and came with a side of fried rice. The dumplings were thick and pipping hot. The sautéed noodles were a great mix to our normal meal and the shrimp fried rice was okay.... the only thing that didn't blow my mind because it tasted like white rice more so then a lightly fried rice. Overall go and support because this was incredible> This is my favorite soup dumpling restaurant in Boston. Heck, it's better than some wildly craved New York soup dumpling joints.  Look at my photo! You'll see that exhilarating pouch of yummy and juicy soup dumpling waiting anxiously for you to suck on until it empties its entire content in your eager mouths. There's a few other options in Chinatown that's quite good but the soup in this one is super addictive. We also had watercress with beef in satay sauce. It was on the saltier side but still, it was mad good! Next time you see a line outside of Gourmet Dumpling House, please consider trying this place.  You might end up loving this more!","4, 2, 3, 5, 5"

I decided to come here this past Saturday for dinner with some friends and my boyfriend. We joined the Yelp Waitlist and thank goodness we did!! We waited about 30-45 minutes after we checked in and that's a given since it was a Saturday night and there was a lot going on around the area. Once we were seated we ordered quickly since we were hungry! We got two different cuts of lamb, two different cuts of beef, the tofu platter, the veggie platter, the mushroom platter, grilled sausages, lamb dumplings, half and half broth, fish fillet, and shrimp paste. The shrimp paste and fish fillet were very light and airy! The shrimp paste was very fluffy and I love getting shrimp paste anywhere that offers it. I loved the tofu platter the most because they offer this one roll that was AMAZING!! I loved it so much that I went to the store to buy some for at home hot pot. It was my first time and it was perfect. Soft and quick to cook. All of the platters are ~$15, but split is so SO worth because they give you a lot!! The variety and the amount, they are DEFINITELY NOT stingy! The beef and the lamb were super soft and tender. They cooked quickly. I honestly didn't need any sauce, but they do offer you sauce if you ask. The veggies platter was fresh and full of lots of greens! The service and the store is clean. Ambiance is your typical hot pot place. Just be mindful of the wait, the store is pretty tiny so put yourself on the Yelp waitlist to save some time. I can't wait to be back!> My boyfriend and I came on a weekend night. It was really full, so we had to stand for about 30 minutes before being seated. We got the house broth, which was much more flavorful that I had expected! We ordered the lamb shoulder, fatty beef, enoki mushrooms, quail eggs, and fish balls. Everything was very delicious! I especially loved the quail eggs and the fatty beef! The fatty beef was so tender and addicting - I wish the platter came with more!We had a wonderful time over dinner and would definitely come back again!> Food: 4Service: 5Ambience: 4Overall: 4.5Came here for the first time with my friend after seeing there was finally no wait! We got the half spicy half regular broth and ordered a bunch of meats and veggies. The food choices were average and nothing sets them apart from other hotpot places, until you try their broth!This is the only hotpot place that doesn't offer you dipping sauces and the reason being is because their broth is SOO flavorful that when you cook your food in it, it's already good enough without extra help. This was new to me because all the hotpot places I've visited there was always some kind of sauce for me to dip in. I must say the spicy broth got a bit salty towards the end of my meal, but i love sodium so it didn't bother me one bit. It was also the perfect balance of mala, so it was a very enjoyable level of spicy. I will definitely come back here for my hotpot cravings. P.S. I love that they give you a bottle of water to refill yourself. More places should do this to avoid dehydrating their customers.> Happy Lamb reminds me a lot of Xiao Fei Yang (Little Fat Sheep - which I grew up eating when I took annual trips to California to see family) in that it is one of those places where you don't need a sauce bar because the broth is SO concentrated and so flavorful already that cooking the food in just the broth is enough - and it's simple, spicy or not spicy or both?I'll admit it's pricier than other hot pot places especially when more all you can eat options are on the rise but my friend and I collectively ordered 6 people's worth of food for the 2 of us (no regrets) and we had our spicy broth refilled so many times (never lost that concentrated flavor even with the 3-4 refills) and each portion of the veggies, meat and fish balls, and tofu and noodles was SO plentiful that we were able to take home leftovers - and yes Happy Lamb let us take home our leftovers. We each got to fill a tall tupperware with that amazing broth and our excess food.And while I forked over ~$50ish bucks, the photos don't lie in how much food was consumed (people stared at us through the storefront windows ...). Plus as I have said a couple times already - that broth is SO flavorful I ate my leftovers and then was able to add a little water and my own meats, noodles, and veggies for a few more days of hot pot. I never tired of that spicy soup!Also pro tip: get the dumplings and dip it in that broth! It heats the dump up a little and jacks up that tastiness with that broth magic.> Very nice place for hot pot. Their style is a Mongolian soup style. I had  the spicy and regular bone broth. Please note that the spicy  broth really got chunks of Chili peppers chopped up and when you scoop out your meats from your broth, huge pieces of chili gets stuck in your soup strainer. The soup broth itself is amazing. Nice selection of Angus beef and lamb and homemade fish balls. Place is clean and friendly. The staff spoke English well.","5, 5, 4, 5, 4"

I think they do a good job with the packing and are pretty generous with the portions. I have always enjoyed the taste and always look forward to ordering from them again.> Grabbed a quick lunch here after a particularly grueling Barry's Bootcamp class nearby during a trip to Boston. I had always seen this fast casual restaurant around but had never tried it. I ordered a bowl with brown rice and kale, chicken, hummus, olives, veggies, and hot harissa sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and everything was super flavorful. Not only that, but the whole thing was only $10, a far cry from similar fast casual places that total up to $15 a dish. Service was quick and our server was great at explaining how the place worked and suggestions for toppings. The restaurant was clean, and because it was a weekend, fairly empty.> I remember eating here when it was Verts. So due to double session workouts on this Sunday, I ended up here at Noon for a kale bowl. My bowl had a bed of kale, grilled steak, which they cooked, fresh so I had to wait a minute for that and the spicy lamb meatball as my proteins. Then all the fresh toppings I added were feta, pickled onions, charred baba ganoush, egg plant relish and garlic sauce. My bowl was delicious! I couldn't finish and had to doggie bag. I can't wait to have this bowl again and maybe try different combos.> I work 2 doors down and today was my 3rd, and last, attempt to eat here. While the different ingredients they offer to make a bowl from are flavorful and plentiful, the chicken they serve made me lose my appetite. It was 50% chicken meat (I hope!) and 50% over-spiced fatty skin, gristle, connective tissue and veins. They chop it up small in hopes you don't notice. Gross! Never again.","5, 5, 5, 3, 2"

It's usually filled with college students, but they've added some barriers to herd everyone in line, so it's a bit better than before.The first time I came, I knew I wanted a chimichanga because those can be hard to find at other mexican ""fast food"" places. The only problem is, I have always ordered chimichangas at restaurants and I don't really know what goes in them - only that I like them. So, when I was asked what I wanted in my chimichanga, I was like ""uh... the normal chimichanga stuff?"". I was kind of scared off, so I just ordered a bowl this last time - ha! They do seem kind of rushed in there which makes it overwhelming if you don't know exactly what/how to order. I'll look up chimichanga ingredients before the next time I go.I will say that I love their spicy chicken. It was full of flavor and they gave a healthy portion. I was able to eat the bowl over 2 meals. The 1 thing I would change is the amount of guac that they put in. It's kinda skimpy.> Worst terrible place to go, rude behavior, always in rush, didn't even listen what I was asking to do, throwing food in bowl like dumping trash in garbage can. Never recommended. 2nd visit, rude staff> A small, unassuming place with some solid burritos that hit the spot on a late-wakeup-weekend. My friends were obsessed with this place and dragged me there, so my expectations were high. They melt cheese onto their tortillas before loading your burrito, and you can get a lot in there for a decent price. I got chicken with lots of toppings and a side of chips and queso. I'm picky about queso, so I wasn't super blown away by this one. The burrito was good, though! Not life-changing, but pretty delicious--no complaints from me. The staff was super friendly and the food was good and affordable--what else can I ask for on a Sunday afternoon?> Horrible place for delivery. I've ordered from here a few times and 3 times I've gotten the order wrong and looks like it was intentionally messed with. Last issue being they missed items from my order and the ones they did decide to make were slop. Mexican plate? I got a cup of rice and beans with 2 pieces of meat smothered in a pint of runny sour cream. No vegetables. Nothing else. Rice beans 2 pieces of meat and 2 cups of sour cream.  Order chips and salsa. Did not get the chips.> This spot is a fan favorite for Northeastern University students, and for good reason. They serve up quality Mexican food, from bowls to burritos, with a range of fresh and authentic ingredients (ex. plantains, veggies etc.) They're also a great option for breakfast, with their $5 breakfast burrito and coffee combo.Just beware of how much they charge you. Amelia's is notorious for over-charging patrons. I don't think they do it on purpose, it might just be a lack of coordination.","4, 1, 1, 4, 1"

My friend and I were so sad once the meal was over because we didn't want it to end!After a long day of walking around Somerville, she and I were in search of a tasty meal. With this place being around the corner from us, we were even more enticed to check it out. We made a reservation for 5:30 and it was packed! The host sat us at the bar -- it was a little cramped, but we had a great view of the kitchen and bar area.  We also had some great conversations with the bartender.We started off with several appetizers: the ceviche with mixed seafood (blue cod, shrimp, squid), and 2 special apps: the octopus with black mayo, and the yuca croqueta. If you had to pick just 1 app to start, definitely go for the mixed seafood ceviche. After we finished, we were both drooling and ready for our next meal!For our entrees, my friend got the arroz con mariscos and I got the tacu tacu. The bartender made sure my pisco sour was always filled while our entrees were being made. I cannot emphasize the view of our food being made in front of us in the open kitchen enough, it was so fun! When the food was out, we were impressed! First of all, the presentation of both dishes was very nice, especially for the arroz con mariscos. The smell that radiated from our plates was amazing too. Most importantly however, they tasted even better than they looked! I literally wanted a bottle of the sauce used for the tacu tacu because it was so flavorful and spicy (Celeste - please seriously consider bottling this sauce. I'll be first in line to buy) At this point we were full, but couldn't pass up the opportunity to try their desserts. Naturally, we got both options: the dulce de leche custard with merengue and the lucuma mousse. Both were delicious as with everything else, but I actually preferred the mousse. The mousse was light and slightly fruity -- perfect for all the delicious food we ate.This place and atmosphere is outstanding. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a phenomenal restaurant in Somerville. After having tasty food in Lima, this is the closest I can get to original Peruvian cuisine in the states.Only downside to this restaurant is that it is a bit small. However, I will make due with that so long as they can continue making this food.Keep up the awesome work and see you soon!!!> What an adorable spot! Celeste has a wonderful ambiance - I loved the music and the art on the walls. The space itself is a lot smaller than I expected, but that made the dining experience feel extra intimate. We ordered the ceviche, two different causas, and the lamb stew to share, in an attempt to depart from my usual lomo saltado. I particularly loved how flavorful and fresh the ceviche tasted! Our server was also very attentive and patient - definitely looking forward to coming back!> 3.5 stars? I wanted to like it more. It's been on my list for a while and we decided to try it for Valentines Day. I believe I made my reservation a month in advance but even then the 10:30 time was all that was left. We arrived about 20 min early and were seated right away which was awesome. The restaurant is small, so there really isn't an area to wait for a table. Service was excellent. Our server had recommendations and was attentive. I very much enjoyed their cocktails, I had both the special for the night as well as a Pisco sour. For an appetizer we had the mixed ceviche, which was delicious and flavorful. For my meal I had the scallops and squid ink pasta. Scallops were good but I found the pasta extremely heavy due to the sauce. My boyfriend had the risotto which he said was good but not amazing. Two other things worth noting... The music was too loud. It was a great mix of tunes, but depending on the song playing we could not hear each other or the server. It was also a very cold night and our table was fairly close to the door so I ended up keeping my coat on as every time someone entered or left there was a blast of chilly air. It looks like on one side of the door they put up some fabric to protect the people dining there, but I think there should be some thing protecting the entire doorway.Ultimately I am glad we went, and we had a good evening. But I don't see myself wanting to go back.> If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would! After a day in Somerville, we stopped in here for a snack and a drink. I called to make sure they were open, which they told us they had a few seats at the bar waiting for us(LOL). In excitement, we rushed over there as fast as we could to find happy and smiling staff welcoming us. It was also a bitter cold day! As we got comfy at the bar, my girlfriend who had been here before told me to try their Pisco Sour, so I did! And, OMG, it was the best cocktail I have ever had. With an egg white, and some other simple ingredients, the Pisco Sour cocktail was refreshing, soft and delicious. We also ordered a few snacks to share: the arugula salad with parmesan, fried yucca and the tuna sashimi. Everything was AMAZING to say the least! And, for dessert I had one of their popular Mezcal's on the rocks (smiling from ear to ear). Celeste is by far one of those restaurants that after eating and drinking here, you can't wait to go back again and again. My friend and I still talk about the experience to this day, and fantasize over their fried yucca and Pisco Sour. It's like a fantasy that you want to relive over and over again. After reading this review, I hope you will take my advice and go check out Celeste, you will be in Heaven!> tl dr; Reasonably priced, generous portions, come if you like seafood and/or Peruvian food!Celeste is a small restaurant in Somerville with around 20 seats. The restaurant stays true to its Peruvian roots, serving Pisco cocktails and other seafood focused dishes. It's impressive that the kitchen can have such variety despite its size. Peruvian is not something I typically have, so I was able to enjoy something new.The restaurant is quite small, so a group of four is about the largest size I would recommend. For four, we had a ceviche, causa, and three entrees and it was the perfect amount of food. The kitchen is quite generous with the portions and everything was a bit larger than what I expected from this type of restaurant. Our waiter had some excellent recommendations and was patient in explaining what the dishes were since many of us had not had Peruvian in the past.Ceviche with mixed seafood with blue cod, shrimp, squid (19): In the past when I've had ceviche from other restaurants, I've always been a bit disappointed, but this time I was thoroughly impressed. First of all, they are very generous with the amount of seafood they served. The plate was packed with seafood, which is the opposite of what I typically find. The acid in the ceviche helps tenderize the fish but not overpower it. The texture of the cod and squid were very soft, but you could still taste its natural favor. Great starter!Causa de avocado and tomato (14): The best way to describe this is a Peruvian potato salad. Potato is layered between avocado and tomato. The dish is creamy from both the potato and the avocado and a sauce over the top, and the tomato helps cut through some of the richness. Not my favorite, but not bad, I would have preferred some other textures maybe.Scallops con pasta a la huancania (27): Squid ink fettuccine and huancania, topped with seared scallops. A close tie for my favorite dish of the night. The pasta sauce is really creamy without being too thick and the scallops were perfectly cooked - seared but still tender in the middle. Tacu tacu a lo macho (27): Rice and beans with mussels, clams, shrimp & squid in panca sauce. The rice and beans combined to form something along the lines of a risotto, creamy and delicious. The shellfish was excellent as well!Carapulcra (25): Incan stew with potato, chicken, pork, peanuts, and Port wine. This is a hearty meat stew served with a side of wine. The stew itself was very flavorful and all of the meat was very tender, just a bit too salty for my taste otherwise it would have been great.Without any drinks or desserts, we ended up paying 35 per person after tip and tax.

The scallops were done perfectly but the pork belly is the star of this dish. I also enjoy the pea and vegetables underneath.

We were disappointed with the quality of the food (had the scallops and the burger, neither were mind blowing). We were unable to express our disappointment with the food, to anyone except a bus boy. We then waited another 15-20 minutes for our check, until a hostess came over and gave us our check. She did not ask us about the quality of the food.This stinks because it was one of our favorite places for drinks and it was ouR first time  having food here> Overall a fine dining experience that wasn't bad, but wasn't anything spectacular.  The cocktails were the best part of the meal (got an New England old fashion that was delicious) and if we go back, it will probably be just for drinks. Ordered a:cheese plate -  smaller than expected (4 different cheeses) but the blue cheese was quite goodbutternut squash soup -  basically just pureed butternut squash in a bowl rather than soup (think more baby food consistency than soup) Pan seared scallop with pork belly - quite good actually but the portion was surprisingly small (3 scallops and 3 chunks of pork belly) Farro and spinach salad - nothing special, literally contained the exact 4 ingredients listed on the description and nothing else. The service and atmosphere were good, but the food lacked that ""something special"" that would make us come back for more.> Wow. I am never coming back. To start off, the ambiance is pretty cool. And that's where it ends. So, we waited an hour and a half for our table. I'm not even sure why we bothered making a reservation... but oh well. We grabbed a drink and didn't mind. When my friend asked for the status, the hostess said she seated the wrong party and said she made the mistake (which resulted in our almost 2 hour wait). But anyhow, we eventually got seated and I wanted to have a conversation with the manager just to see what was going on. When the manager Lem Taipan came, he was completely rude and unprofessional. He didn't even apologize and said ""It's been busy, what could we do?"" Just PURE rudeness and completely brash in response. I explained that this was our first time and the impression was bad. He was unapologetic and did not care. This made us feel like shit. I've worked in a restaurant before as a hostess and it's really not hard to own up to mistakes and just say sorry on your behalf as manager. Wow. I don't know. Our table was speechless and the attitude of the manager killed our vibe. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant and workers were unprofessional and they honestly did not give a shit about their diners. Two thumbs down, do not recommend. Go somewhere that actually cares about their job, their customers, and their food. (being that it was fucking mediocre).> LOVED the ambiance, the service, AND the food! I got the back bay burger which was BEAUTIFUL with a perfectly buttered brioche bun. Boston has been a disappointment in the burger department and this is definitely the best I've had here by far. It was juicy, tender, and the sweet potato fries are a must! They're amazingly crispy on the outside but somehow still tender on the inside. The best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Service was quick and friendly. Will definitely be back here soon. Honestly I would come back just for the fries!","5, 1, 3, 1, 5"

The second time I came here, I tried the lamb kabob and THAT was the right move.

Anyways. Came in and saw the HUGE menu, which is super neat and laid out. Already knew I was the shawarma plate. Now I was a bit skeptical because it wasn't on the skewer but it smelled so good. The plate came with meat, rice pilaf and salad. The plate was HUGE. It easily could have been 2 meals, juicy meat, seasoned rice. Drunk me ate the whole thing AND ordered a baklava to go with it because YOLO. Baklava was sweet and crispy, prefect made.

The server said ""OK cool""Would not recommend> Did an Odyssey cruise for a work function, with the full sunset experience, dinner, and DJs, and it was great. Dinner was surprisingly good, actually, and had a few vegetarian options. The DJs had the dancefloors full, like full-on wedding style energy. The cruise part was very nice, great vantage points of Boston and the harbor. Although I didn't have to pay for any part of it, I would still recommend this as a special activity to do while in Boston (or for those that live here).> Boarded the ship for a school event with dinner/dance floor/bar access. Dinner was buffet style and was decent. Great space, beautiful views- especially from the top deck.However, the bar was a scam. The liquor beverages were watered-down. After checking in with other guests, we came to the consensus that after several drinks, we were completely sober. We payed full price for the mixed drinks and were ripped off.

My advice: order a beer instead and watch them pour it to ensure you won't be ripped off.> I arrived in Boston Friday night October 11 to wind and rain. My sweetheart made reservations for us for a lovely dinner cruise only to find out this beautiful yacht was going to be dockside mandated by the Coast Guard.

We informed her that we were from the west coast and would not be able to use a voucher in the future and is there anything she could do while we were in town.

First impression is very good as the interior decor exudes a very relaxed yet upscale atmosphere. We went at around 1:30 and it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. The service was friendly but my only gripe is that it took a while for food and drinks to come out. The food itself was somewhat worth the wait. The portion size was underwhelming for my steak and eggs. The size of the steak was not worth the $17 they charge for it, and it also was still a bit bloody as it ran into my eggs. It had a great flavor though with the chive hollandaise. The roasted potatoes were good too as it soaked up some of the hollandaise sauce. My friend who got the brunch burger looked like he got the better end of selection as it looked perfectly cooked and portion-wise was very on point. The truffle fries that came with it were to die for as well. Ultimately I think I will be coming back here as a regular as I am interested in the other selections they have for brunch.> This is great after work spot! The food is good, though I mainly go here for drinks they have some great tequila drinks. What I've tried and liked so far:-Pork Belly Bao-Clam Chowder: their chowder is different, good different. -Rail Stop Burger-Baked Lasagna -Truffle Fries: I don't recommend the truffle fries... I could say it was worse truffle fries I've ever had.> Rail Stop hosted our company's annual Holiday Party this past weekend, and it was an amazing experience. Josh, the manager, was outstanding. We told him what we wanted and he made it happen.Our party was huge: 125 people were on the guest list and I was terrified of running out of food. Josh helped me come up with a plan, and he even made sure to have backup food for me and the guests in case we ran out. Even with over a hundred people taking up the bar area, it didn't ever feel crowded, nor did anyone go without food or drink. The bartenders were exceptionally friendly and speedy. The food was OUTSTANDING. We ordered the mezze platter, charcuterie, antipasto, crudite, and cheese platter, and we also had passed appetizers: veggie burgers, regular sliders, spring rolls, buffalo chicken. . . everything was perfect. I will definitely be dining here again. Thank you Josh and everyone at Rail Stop.> Had a fantastic dinner date here with my girl this Saturday night. The ambiance of the space is very nice, open and talkative, but still cozy and not too loud. The table service was friendly and efficient, but not intrusive. Had the steak frites which was delicious, and came with greens and big potatoes wedges. Girlfriend had the fried chicken sandwich which she also enjoyed. Manhattan and a rum styled manhattan to go along which were delicious.> Drinks and small plates at Rail Stop were delicious! The bees knees drink was the perfect amount of sweetness - and for someone who doesn't typically go for gin, the gin taste was not overpowering and I really enjoyed the drink. It even had an edible hibiscus flower which was juicy and delicious! The small plates were all fantastic. My favorite was the devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates), I only wish they came with a side of balsamic for dipping. Rail Stop has a good variety of options on the menu and a great ambiance inside. Lively bar area for drinks after work.","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

I wanted to get other stuff but it was so good I just kept getting the chicken cutlet sandwich. Used to go all the time when I worked over there. You even start actually feeling bad for the other sandwich shops in the area at some point...places you thought were pretty good. It's pretty simple too. I really don't know what they do. Maybe it's the braided roll or maybe it's the cutlets or the pickles or the mayo... I don't know....and the only reason I'm writing this review on a Friday night from the North shore (where I live now), and I hardly ever write reviews, is because I saw some Postmates ad on Facebook with a chicken sandwich and it reminded me of this chicken sandwich (not really but in the sense that it was good) and I'm thinking...how can I get this.> The first time I ate here, I ordered a vegetarian sandwich to go. Upon arriving at my final destination, I unwrapped the sandwich to find a chicken sandwich inside. As a vegetarian, I was disgusted and irritated that I spent my entire lunch break transporting this sandwich, only to find I couldn't eat it upon arrival. I went back and they were happy to make a new one, but it was not tasty at all. The bread was somehow hard and soggy at the same time, and the flavor was lacking.Fast forward a few months, my boyfriend and I brought our lunch (spaghetti and soup) from another establishment to eat at one of the tables here. We picked a corner table, and thought it would be okay since there was no signage telling us otherwise like the other restaurants in this building. Not to mention, another older gentleman was reading a newspaper (and not eating a sandwich) at another table adjacent to us. The owner came over and wished the newspaper gentleman a happy new year, then told us ""we don't sell that food here! These tables are for our customers!"". I apologized & offered to leave politely, since I understood it could be a policy or something, even though there were no other customers in the restaurant (besides the newspaper gentleman). We wiped the table clean, and left. Upon leaving, we saw the owner talking poorly about us to the newspaper gentleman, whom he did NOT kick out, even though he was not eating a sandwich either. Very poor representation of professionalism, and frankly, quite ageist. Had I received a bit of reciprocated politeness from the owner, such as ""hello there / good afternoon / hi, our policy is these tables are for dine-in only, I'm really sorry"" instead of an abrupt ""we don't sell that here!"" with no greeting, my review would be a higher star instead.*edited to address the owner's response below: I apologize if our actions broke your policy, but we simply did not know there was one. I feel my review is fair based on the food I received the first time around + my last experience, and I don't think bringing our parents' child-rearing methods is appropriate to address on social media. Happy New Year.> I work near Copley and this place is just around the corner. It's actually inside the French Consulate building. My company's lunch selection isn't great so I would usually go here to get a sandwich to go through yelp or other apps. I waited once in line for 30 minutes so not ideal. Some of my favorite sandwiches are the north end, New England chicken salad or the sweet Carolina Q. You can't really go wrong with anything. And picked is an added bonus. The prIce is also cheap enough so give it a try!> Working across the street, I love ordering Back Bay Sandwich on Ritual. Back Bay Sandwich allows you to get half a classic deli sandwich for $3.50 pre-tax and it comes with a pickle. Those are my go-to's when I'm not super hungry but want something fresh, not from my work cafeteria. A few months ago, my friend introduced me to the Chicken Margherita Sandwich for about $8 - I inhaled it my first few times ordering it. It was that good! It has your classic fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and olive oil drizzle - but also breaded chicken (baked, I believe) and wow, the combo is delicious! You get the tasty protein countered by the fresh ingredients. Having ordered so many times, I must say my sandwich is assembled inconsistently and tastes slightly different sometimes but all within range that I'd still call delicious and highly recommend!Most of the time, I place an order on Ritual and pick it up when it's ready because right around lunch time ~12PM, it gets p a c k e d and the line is out the door, into the hallway. Picking up is seamless, it's always ready on the counter and despite missing the in-person experience of purchasing, the man behind the counter usually takes a moment to say thank you or have a great day.> This place makes the best sandwiches in the area! I love their signature menu. If you're looking for a place to eat for lunch around the area I completely recommend this place. FYI, this place is JAM PACKED when it's lunch time.  I recommend you download the ritual app and place your order. Still expect delays though.  Sometimes the app would say the sandwich is ready but it's not... not sure if it's the app or the place but, not consistent.","5, 1, 4, 4, 4"

We both got hot pot as well. I got prime rib and she got short rib. The food was good, as hot pot usually is(can't really mess up food you make yourself). The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is obviously not the food. The service was mediocre. Our waitress started taking our order then got distracted& started taking to someone else behind us. Which I found rude. Our bill ended up coming out to $102. What also gets me is that a can of Pepsi cost $3. I have no problem with paying but that's quite expensive for a can of soda. We went on a Saturday night at about 6pm. Lucky we we're able to get seated in 45 minutes. I'd suggest to make a reservation& get a table.> Such a bizarre experience. I was pretty hyped up as shabu is one of my favorite things in the world and couple of my friends highly recommended this place. We got lamb and pork cheeks platters for two; their portion was quite tiny for the money I paid, but I did end up getting full and everything seemed super-fresh. But the reason why I downed a star or two is because of unsatisfactory service. First, we were seated in the corner by the window and waitstaffs rarely came by. It took a while for us to find out that some of the side dishes/sauce and water were missing. One time when she did come to us voluntarily, though, was to show us a picture of her friend whom my cousin ""looked very alike."" I don't think she meant any harm but it's just so cringey. That said, I'll revisit some other time just for the food and the convenience of this location but I'd love to see better customer service.> Absolutely amazing, make sure you try the sesame sauce! Servers were very nice, and the lunch combo price was great for Boston hotpot> We came here for lunch and to celebrate a special occasion. Location was easy and convenient. Right within Copley Mall Plaza and on the same floor as the Westin hotel. Manager there was great. She helped serve us and made sure our drinks were always filled whenever she came by to check on us.  We had a male server trying to take our order but a female server came in and took over. It's our first time there and she was aggressive Ain upselling us on everything on the menu, and made some confusing suggestions. We somehow got moved away from the lunch menu and had full orders of all our selections being served. The younger male server had no chance so I assume he's new. Food arrived and for the prices we paid for full orders, I was not so impressed. We got the prime rib, pork and 2 seafood platters with some teas. The broths were tasty and typical. We got the Szechuan spicy broth and the miso broth. Price came up to $200. For. Lunch.  I thought of going to Kaze for their lunch specials - they give more food than here for lunch and it's $10 - $12 per platter. Maybe it's because of location that it's so expensive but the food did not justify the cost. Many hotpot places in Chinatown would be just as a great an experience but a fraction of the cost. Probably won't be back here unless someone else pays.> Pretty good experience doing a hot pot place for the first time. We did the miso stock with meatoptions of pork cheek, A5 Wagyu, and chicken breast. The pork cheek did not impress me with this cooking style however A5 Wagyu dipped for 15-20 seconds in full boil was melt in your mouth amazing. The miso stock wasn't the best I have had however it was better than average. Very satisfying. The servers were kind and patient since we were hot pot noobs and helped us along the way through the ordering process. I would however say the prices for some items were a touch steep. That was the only downside for me. I would visit again and would likely stick to one meat for myself.","4, 2, 5, 3, 4"

The chicken soup was comforting and had what appeared to be cut up tandoori chicken in it at $3.99 was reasonable.> Used to be one of my favorite places to order from (one of the rare places with paneer masala) but it definitely seems that they've changed cooks or something since the food has become incredibly spicy even when ordering mild and much less flavorful.> Second momo experience here. This time got the chicken momos. Love the 2 sauces! They have a special on the chicken momos Monday and on the vegetable momos Wednesday! Next time I come I want to do all appetizers. We got meals, and the portions were huge. I got the plantain curry (because I love plantains). It was tasty, but I thought the plantains would be sweeter- that may just be the style though. The garlic naan was nice for scooping up the sauce.> I got the chicken momo special on Mondays ($4.50). The momos were very fresh. The dough wrapping was thin but still strong enough to pick up without poking a whole through the dough.

It tasted like a mix between spicy honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I got the small jerk chicken plate and my husband ordered the curry chicken plate. Both our plates came with fried plantains, mixed veggies, and rice and beans. The mixed veggies had broccoli, onions, and peppers. The rice tasted like brown rice and I've never tried a Caribbean place that used brown rice for their rice and beans but I thought it was pretty good. We ordered our food through Grubhub in the Yelp app and it came about 15 minutes before the earliest time they said they would be there. Awesome! I just wish there were some options of drinks on the grub hub app like some coconut water or Kola champagne. :( I also received a call about 10 minutes after placing my order from someone from the restaurant letting me know that they were running low on curry chicken. He said they would be happy to substitute the other half of meat for half of another meat. I think he could tell that I didn't know what to pick and he told me he could give me some of the turkey, jerk chicken, and the curry chicken as a mixed plate. I really appreciated that since we got to try most of their main meat options. Our two favorites ended up being the jerk chicken with the yellow sauce and the curry chicken. The curry chicken was flavorful and juicy and the jerk chicken had a mild spice to it and a really nice charred meat flavor. Also, the guy from Grubhub who dropped off our order was super friendly. I would be happy to order from here again. :)> My daughter and I are visiting from Atlanta by way of St Louis. We ordered through GrubHub $32 worth and it wasn't worth it... She had the curry chicken which was good, however, the jerk chicken seemed old & not fresh. I ordered extra sauce and both sauces were not very tasty... they tasted weird. The jerk sauce did not taste like authentic jerk sauce & the curry sauce tasted like barbecue sauce. The veggies that came with were squash onions and peppers which is not original to the islands and I was disappointed and the rice and beans tasted dry.  We were disappointed although the curry chicken was better overall it wasn't a very tasty experience.> Great quality, taste and quantity. Exceptionally good customer service. I have lived all over the Caribbean and it won't get better than this.

Foodies would call Trident a really strong restaurant that also sells books and things.As a book and things vendors, I mean, yeah, this is the core of their business: stocking everything hipster want to read, a number of level two woke titles, as well as the mass pubs ideal for parents or Secret Santa trades. Don't ignore the strong tchotchke and trinket goodies on the table running spine through the first floor - lots of quirk for gift givers.As an event space, Trident holds a number of readings and signings on the second floor, permitting a separate audience to maintain ambiance uninterrupted by casual shoppers. The layout is beneficial to introspective or emotional works that would be outright ruined if broken by a bro yelling, ""Aw dude, they got Stassi's Basic Bitch book. Harharhar.""I mean, they do have it, but still...> I am really sad that I have to write a 3-star review because I really wanted to give Trident a 5-star review. I love Trident, as a bookstore, it is super chic and totally unique. It is definitely my first stop when it comes to amazing books, memorable birthday gifts and whenever you need a unique trinket or gift. I first ate at Trident in Oct of 2017, before the fire. I absolutely LOVED the food and could not wait to go back. Then the fire happened and college got a hold of me so I, unfortunately, did not make it back until March 2020. I don't know if it was the time of day we went to eat (lunchtime) but the food was just bad. Overcooked, burnt and tasted like grease/oil with a side of food. I had an omelet and pancakes and I was expecting so much more. Trident's pancakes are rated some of the best in Boston and I was disappointed. I will be back...just not for the food.> First of all, Trident is a BOOKSTORE that sells alcohol and delicious meals. What else do you really need in life?They don't take reservations on the weekend, so expect a wait. Luckily, you can peruse the bookstore in the meantime. We went for brunch, but take note that they have events, ranging from speed dating to trivia, most weeknights. We ordered a bunch of different items. The best was the eggs Benedict. Perfectly cooked, and you could actually cut through the English muffin. On the other hand, you should AVOID the huevos rancheros. I'm really surprised because I've been impressed with everything I've eaten during multiple visits, until seeing that dish. As you can see in the picture, this is two tortillas, with very limited toppings, and an egg on top. There is a bit of salsa on the side, but it's really disappointing. Basically, definitely go to Trident and order anything except the huevos rancheros and you'll have an awesome time!> Review is strictly for the gift shop and book store. I feel complete when I walk into a bookstore and see many items geared toward the enjoyment of reading. The #blinddatewithabook wall selection is just that sort of thing and thrilled me to see it.  Great selection of greeting cards... I mean the nice ones on good card stock with creative expressions and artwork.I didn't eat here but the vibe was Hella trendy in here and the music was nice to wander around to. Customer service was ok. Respectfully Reviewed> Trident has a super cute concept that is clearly very popular, as evidenced by the bustling crowds in the bookstore and café even at 3 pm on a Monday. My group of four went to the café for a late snack/lunch and enjoyed sharing three dishes!We tried the eggs benedict, French toast stuffed with lemon ricotta, and prosciutto & brie sandwich. Our waitress was really nice and accommodated our request to cut the sandwich into four pieces, and she also offered to bring out plates so we could share. The food was good; the French toast was pleasantly plush, and the sandwich was balanced and came with satisfying ridged potato chips. When broken open, the eggs were not as runny as expected. I'm not the best judge of traditional breakfast foods as I don't eat them too often/tend to prefer to eat a lot of desserts on the less sweet side, but my friends felt that the French toast was lacking in filling and could've used whipped cream.The store is a fun place to browse with a variety of books and trinkets, although it can be difficult to access items in the narrow aisles. If even two people stop to talk, as often occurs, the entire section becomes inaccessible.Still, I would recommend Trident as a fun place to grab a bite and spend time with friends! The café has plenty of tables and seats and is a good place to have a chat, and wandering through the store is quite fun.","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

Everyone in our party enjoyed themselves and were satisfied. My only criticism was that my potatoes were not very hot and I had to ask for a coffee refill- A personal pet peeve- servers should keep my coffee cup full. This is especially true at a diner at breakfast time.> *** 11/2019 ***A seasonal specials sheet caught my eye.The Pumpkin Bisque with smoke gouda $5.99 bowl was savory tasty rich, but served lukewarm instead of hot.Both Victoria's Hangover Burger $13.99 (8 oz Angus beef patty topped with a fried egg, smoked bacon, American cheese, smother with black pepper maple syrup aioli) and Victoria's Breakfast Sandwich $10.99 (2 fried eggs, melted pepper jack cheese, famous turkey hash, topped with chipotle mayo) were served on a jumbo English muffin.  Both were pretty good.  I was just bummed that somehow I always seem to end up with the short end of the stick with my portion of french fries, which by the way, was terrific on this visit.Off the regular menu, the breakfast burrito (shaved sirloin with two scrambled eggs, peppers, onions and pepper jack cheese $10.49) was missing something.  It just wasn't particularly well flavored, and the beef came out a bit tough.  The portion sufficed though.*** 12/2019 ***New seasonal specials sheet, though there wasn't one on our table, so I borrowed the one I spotted at an empty table not too far away.Two of us ended up sharing two of the specials:Shashuka $14.99This famous breakfast dish from Israel is a delicious mix of 2 poached eggs, smothered with mozzarella and gouda cheese, in a  homemade tomato sauce spiced with onions, garlic, cilantro and paprika... Served with a side of toast and homefries or hash browns.Huevos Rancheros $14.99This famous breakfast dish from Mexico is a delicious mix of 2 eggs any style, served with avocado, black beans, cilantro, topped with salsa and shredded cheddar on a corn tortilla.Another friend later commented that traditionally, shashuka is vegetarian, the eggs are cooked in the tomato sauce, and there is no cheese in it.Victoria's may not have been traditional, but somehow the mix with the potato cubes found beneath the gooey saucy cheese with lovely bits of onion and unannounced yet welcome basil leaves was quite tasty, rich, and filling.The other dish was enjoyed by our resident vegetarian.  Visually, it was a bit deconstructed a plating, with the tortillas arriving the form of two folded tortilla shells, which we found out could be swapped out for pita upon request.  I made myself a breakfast tortilla with my shell.Of the two, I preferred the Shashuka, but if recollections serve me well, I think I may revisit Victoria's Breakfast Sandwich sooner, if it continues to remain on their special roster.*** 1/2020 ***Guess the hash browns were short lived.  They weren't offered on this visit when a bunch of ordered omelettes for lunch.The breakfast potatoes were quite good, and they filled the New Market Veggie $10.99 (minus the jalapenos please) quite well with crisp firm vegetables, which made it feel like a sensible healthy option.  A DC however wasn't crazy about the sweetened marinade used in their fried chicken.Even though the steak tips in my Victoria's Steak Sandwich on Ciabatta $11.99 came north of the requested medium rare, the meat was still quite pleasantly tender.I've been hankering lately to give their French Toast a try, and only recently realized that their Eggs & Cakes $8.99 come with either pancakes OR french toast ($5.99 a la carte for 2 pieces) with 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes or grits, and choice of toast.  Hmmm...No more Monthly Specials for now it seems.> Victoria's Diner is something of an institution. Around for decades, it's a great local diner with a large menu selection. I went with a few friends, and we all ordered from the breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs and cakes - a HUGE portion of eggs, pancakes, home fries, and toast. It was tasty, and again - huge. I couldn't finish, but not for lack of trying. My friends ordered the Southern eggs Benedict and the breakfast burger. They were both very happy.Our server was efficient and lovely. The food came out quickly, and she was always ready to refill our coffee. The prices at Victoria's are more expensive than I typically like to pay at a diner, but I expect it's due to its popularity. Get there early on weekends because it can fill up.> I've only gone here at night. From college to now. So I've have plenty of mixed experiences. Pancakes at 2am are always awesome.Burgers usually are too but this burger was dry. Tried my friend waffles fries with cheese. Those were pretty cool.> Solid breakfast, friendly staff, quick & straight forward Would come back to try more from their menu!","4, 3, 4, 4, 3"

Great & fresh sandwiches, wonderful selection of varied breakfast platters, awesome smoothies and some decent baked items as well.The staff are incredibly fast, organized, efficient, friendly and they make great breakfast! I wish I could have breakfast and lunch here every day, but for now I'll settle for the occasional weekend visit.> While staying in Boston, I found Style Cafe because of it's close proximity to my hotel.  They had a lengthly menu with breakfast and lunch options to interest everyone.  I ordered the turkey, brie, tomato and basil on brioche which hit the spot!  My boyfriend ordered the Colombian breakfast and was so happy with his choice.  I also ordered the lentil soup to-go which was homemade, and tasted just like moms!  The cranberry bread was moist, and perfectly baked!  And their tea selection was great!  Organic teas, with several options to choose from.  I wish their was a style cafe close by to home, I would make it my go-to morning spot!> Yum!!! I can only say great things (or ""tings"") about Style cafe. Food was fresh, delicious and really reasonably priced. I'd definitely go back.> Five times is not a charm at style Café. While staying with my friend for a few months at Flagship Wharf, I decided to frequent style café out of convenience and their menu was fine. But every time I went there -- there was an issue of some sort of another. This last time I ordered a meatball sandwich got it all the way up to our apartment on the 7th floor -- only to find it had been made and served to us on moldy bread. There is no way that whoever made that sandwich did not realize that was moldy bread. There's just no way.A time or two before I remember I ordered a sandwich and a Diet Coke. As I sat staring at the cashier for 15 or 20 minutes I finally said to her ""is my sandwich almost ready?""  She replied ""oh I didn't know you ordered a sandwich.""Really? You think I'm just standing here staring at you for 15 minutes -- oy.I'm serious if you look at my profile I've never left a negative review, but after six months of nonsense they really need to get their act together. The Navy Yard deserves better.> In Boston from North Carolina on a sight seeing trip. Chose style cafe for breakfast since we were heading to Charlestown to see the shipyard. If you are looking for a ""to-go"" sandwich it is an ok place. If you are hoping to sit down and enjoy a plate with service choose somewhere else.","4, 5, 5, 1, 2"

The staff and the atmosphere made it the perfect place for a celebration. A member of our group has celiac and were accommodated with several dining options.We selected the calamari and Bibb salad for starts - both were delicious.The Veal chop, gf gnocchi with bolognese as well as the haddock were tasty and satisfying. The wine pairings were perfect. We will return.> We had a great first visit here the other night.  Lets start with the vibe and setting.  The tables are well-spaced and the ambiance is really nice for a quiet dinner.  It would be great for a group too but on a Tuesday, it was relatively quiet which is what we were looking for.The service was excellent with good advice and attention to details.  We had the tuna tartare and the scallop crudo to start.  The tartare is HUGE and definitely shareable.  It was really nice tuna with just a few crisps to add some texture.  The scallop crudo was bigger than your typical crudo and had a really nice blend of textures and flavors.For mains, we had the scallops and halibut which were both excellent.  The halibut had just a schmear of butternut squash and a nice, but modest, portion of brussel sprouts.  If you order this expecting much more than the fish, you should get a side.  We didnt need to do that and with a starter, were definitely full by the end.The cocktail list is EXCELLENT and the Cinghiale was a nice twist on a manhattan with the smoke of scotch instead of bourbon.  The wine menus is extensive and the choices by the glass are great.  We went albarino and rosso di montalcino which were both terrific.We couldnt stay for dessert but there were definitely interesting choices and a great bourbon list (and other things too) with probably 40-50 to choose from just for the bourbons.We really enjoyed our dinner which had to be quick and will be back!> I had the fish stew with lobster, tuna, shrimp, squids, clams, mussels.  Perfect soup base - flavorful without being salty, allowing the fresh seafood natural flavors to come through.  There was a piece of toasted bread with some cream sauce I didn't care for.  Just plain garlic butter bread would have been better.  The service was excellent especially I was dining alone (often neglected).  The older waiter was super sweet.  Highly recommend this dining experience!> We LOVE Prezza. It is by far one of the best Italian restaurant in Boston's North End. We love the shrimp and flower zucchini appetizers, and all of the home made pasta entrees and deserts. Service is always impeccable, and their wine selection is top tier. Prezza never disappoints and you're guaranteed to have an amazing experience and a very special meal. Valet lot across from Prezza is usually $20-$25 - parking is difficult around there. Bring cash. Highly recommend Prezza!> This is the second time visiting Prezza - and for a bachelorette dinner. The bride to be is very close with the staff and the dinner was unique and delicious. Soup to start - seasonal and fresh fall ingredients. Next a few apps! Arancini, Caprese salad, olives, prosciutto. As an entree the gnocchi and of course for dessert a selection of tiramisu, cannoli, cookies, and other delights! The staff is attentive, knowledgeable and they make sure your entire experience is the best. Love Prezza!","5, 5, 5, 5, 5"

First off, big shoutout to our waiter who I thought did an excellent job service wise and was also really personable. The experience actually highlighted even more how disappointing the service we'd had at No. 9 Park the night before was. We started with the clams Orfano as well as the Nonna's garlic bread (which I forgot to take a picture of) paired with Parmesan mousse. While the clams were good, I think there was just too much breadcrumbs on top which while providing necessary textural contrast seemed overwhelming and too dry. Parmesan mousse was interesting different but might have liked the warm hand-pulled mozzarella instead which was the other starter we were considering. The bf got the maltagliati for his pasta course which was good. I was also tempted by the other pastas but suspected I didn't have the space for it plus I was gonna get the pizza lasagne as my main. Our waiter brought over the largest pepper mill ever (must have been like at least 3 ft!) which made me exclaim in surprise haha. The pizza lasagne was good and had that crispy cheese that's part of lasagna's appeal. My friend got the monkfish piccata and raved about the sauce. The bf got the pig parmesan. For dessert, we split the ricotta cheesecake pie. Overall, a good meal!> It was really good but the portion sizes are so small for the price. At least the high end Italian restaurants in the north end give good portions. I got gnocchi and there were 7 for $20 But other than that it's really good and absolutely adorable on the inside! If you're balling and aren't  very hungry then no worries!> It's... fine. But as fans of Tiffani Faison's food and restaurants, we expected to be blown away- and weren't. My dining group all agreed: Orfano comes in a distant third to this group's other 2 excellent restaurants (Tiger Mama and Sweet Cheeks), and can't really compete with other local Italian spots we like. Every dish we tried was fine- reasonably tasty, cooked appropriately, not bad in any real way. But none of it was as delicious as what I've had at Tiger Mama (OMG that cha ca la vong), Sweet Cheeks (biscuitsssss and farm saladdddd, drool), or Fox & the Knife (that pasta, and chickpeas, and amaro cart tho).The garlic bread was fine- but was on the drier side and could have been amped up with more butter/garlic/cheese/flavor. The Orfano clams were fine- but were missing something (probably more butter and pancetta, both for more flavor and to make it less dry and crumbly). The fusili alla vodka was fine- tasty sauce, but the pasta was standard and there was not enough of it (definitely not an entree portion IMO, more like an app portion but for $24). My pig parm was fine- nicely crispy with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, but the dark meat was a bit on the tough side (whereas I like a tender tonkatsu) and didn't have enough moz/cheese/flavor. My dining companion's swordfish was fine- cooked nicely, good flavors, but nothing special. The chocolate cake was fine- nicely presented, good flavor, but not enough crunchy bits for textural contrast and nothing that stood out (just a solid chocolate cake). Basically, everything we ate was missing something to take it from technically OK to really good.To their credit, service was excellent, the atmosphere is classy and cool (think they describe it as an old-school steakhouse but for females?), and the cocktails are inventive yet classic and delicious. It's a place I wouldn't mind coming back to if someone wanted to go, by any means- but is not a place I'd suggest myself because I think the other places I mentioned are better and thus more worth your $. I will continue to be a fan of this chef and restaurant group though- you'll just need to find me at their other 3 spots instead of this one.> You know when it comes to a Tiffani Faison restaurant; the aesthetics, ambience, food, and service is going to be on point. Orfano definitely checked off some of those boxes. To start, service was excellent and our server Charlie was really great.For appetizers: we got mozzarella, prosciutto (?), garlic bread, meatballs, calamari, and the caesar salad. Out of that list, I would HIGHLY recommend the meatballs. The meatballs themselves were super flavorful and the sauce it comes with was good enough to drink! And I would slightly recommend the calamari but, too much onions and not enough actual calamari. The garlic bread was kinda stale and everything else was meh.For pastas: lobster bucatini, cacio e pepe, bolognese, and their summer pasta (forgot the name). The lobster bucatini was incredible, my favorite dish of the entire night. The bolognese was a little on the basic side albeit still really tasty and done right. My group really enjoyed the cacio e pepe, I wasn't a fan and thought it was bland and dry. Skip the Summer pasta, it tasted like a garden with black pepper.For entrees: veal chop, chicken, and monkfish. My group all agreed the veal chop was the weakest dish of the night. Bland and not enough sauce was the general consensus. The chicken was very delicious, tender, and cooked perfect. The monkfish dish was also good, the fish itself was kinda bland but the sauce somewhat made up for it.So in summary, get the: meatballs, calamari, lobster bucatini, bolognese, chicken, and monkfish.> Came here the night of the Billy Joel concert, and this place exceeded all expectations! I have watched Top Chef religiously since Season 1 and have been a Tiffani Faison fan ever since. I hoped since Orfano recently opened that she would be there, and she was! Such a thrill to finally meet her! She was so gracious and patiently posed for photos with me. She said Billy Joel ate there the previous evening!The restaurant itself is aesthetically beautiful- as others have noted the Lady Gaga portrait and fun signs by the bathrooms are so cool. I was really looking forward to trying the martini cart, but apparently so was everyone else because we were never able to flag it down. It looks awesome though! And we had an amazing Italian red wine. The food was absolutely delicious- I only wish I could have eaten more! Everything was so fresh - the tomato salad was incredible, and my cacio e Pepe was perfectly al dente with wonderful peppery and cheesy bursts. Everyone was happy with their fresh pastas. Next time I'm back in Boston my first stop is going to be Orfano. And I'm going to order the Pizza Lasagne, because I am obsessed with pizza! I'm kicking myself for not ordering two entrees.We had to rush off to the concert, but I hope to have time for dessert on my next visit. Thank you, Orfano, for a perfect last meal in Boston! Cheers!

Decent decoration as well- Food: really tasty, I didn't leave an ounce of that broth behind - Price: this is the only issue in my opinion. Yes, it's East Cambridge, but paying $25 for one ramen bowl (after tax and tips) feels excessive.> First of all, ramen at the back bar is my go to. Hand crafted drinks along with delicious hot bowl of ramen. Yum! Hugo the head bartender will tell you all about drinks specials and food pairing. He will never let you down. I love their hot pot too. They often have specials for like new broth and appetizers. My favorite app is the spicy shishitto pepper. My favorite broth is the goji berry and mala split pot. Delicious Definitely recommend to peeps who love ramen or hot pot or both .> Finally had time to check this place out!! Came with my boyfriend for lunch, the hostess offer to bring us to the lounge area but my boyfriend decided to try their hot pot. He had the prime rib combo with the Chinese spicy broth and I had the ""bromance"", interesting name for a ramen lol. The meat looked fresh and the charshu for my ramen was WOW, I mean, WOW. Lol. Service was prompt and nice, our server and the manager made sure we had everything we need. If I had to complain, it's a little pricey but I guess you pay for what you get.. Will def come back for dinner!!> If you like DIY foods (think Korean BBQ), try shabu shabu! Your waiter will teach you everything you need to know, but basically you pick a broth, proteins and noodles and the waiter sets up your table. The broth gets heated and, once boiling, you can quickly cook your own meats, veggies and noodles right at the table. It really doesn't take long to cook the food yourself and it's fun to mix and match broths and sauces with the various meats and veggies. Be adventurous and give it try! This place was delicious, well laid out for parties of all sizes and the staff were amazingly helpful (helped us figure out what to order, how to cook, brought us water before we asked, and checked in on our progress regularly despite the restaurant being packed).> Came here for the ramen. First off they have a pretty solid menu with lots of options. I like spicy so I went with the Hells Ramen and yes it was very very spicy. Like acidic spicy the way I prefer (haha).Great vibe and lots of space. In Kendall so easy to come to during work days and for team outings.will try the other options on menu in future.

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,Boston,3,3,Yes,Null,Yes,delfriscos.com,Steakhouses,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,"I came here during restaurant week - made a reservation for 8:15pm on a Friday and ended up running late so I called ahead and told them. I arrived around 8:35pm and was not seated until about 9:05pm. Oh well, it was my fault for running late in the first place so I'm not complaining. A lot of people were also waiting in the lobby - the restaurant is quite big on the inside, it looks really nice. Upon sitting down, we were greeted by our server, and bread was brought over. I wasn't a fan of the unsalted butter and sesame on the bread, but bread is bread. Before coming to the restaurant, I already knew which items I was going to choose from.I did go with the restaurant week options, however my boyfriend and I both upgraded our entrees for an extra $25 to the 45 day dry aged prime ribeye because filet mignons are too lean. We ordered the lobster bisque along with chocolate mousse and cheesecake for dessert. We also ordered Duck Confit Meatballs - they were AMAZING, literally wiped all the sauce off the plate. Definitely worth it. The flavor and sear on the steaks were good - they actually had us cut into the steaks when they brought it out to make sure it was how we liked them. The lighting is not that great, so my boyfriend did not realized that his steak was a bit undercooked. We had both ordered medium rare cooks. It was fine to eat though, and it worked out for our leftovers when we reheated it on the stove it was still soft since it wasn't overdone. The mashed potatoes were just plain mashed potatoes, I wish we got more of it though.  Our dinner was almost two hours long before desserts, so the service is quite slow. If you're not looking to dine for a really long time, make sure to ask for your food to come out quicker. We had somewhere to go that night so I had to ask for my dessert to-go. The cheesecake was REALLY good, it was light and fluffy unlike other really dense cheesecakes. Recommended for date night but only if you're paying restaurant week prices. With the upgrade, each of our 3-course meal went from $38 to $63, which is less expensive compared to ordering the 45 day dry aged steak as an entree ($68).> I was only there for the Restaurant week menu last week. Walk in without much expectations since the past few restaurant week experience from other high end steak house did not wow me (but again, 38 dollars without tax & tips, I wouldn't expect too much). Started with the lobster bisque then The 8oz filet mignon and wrap with with the cheesecake. The lobster bisque was pretty good. It's not extra creamy like some do the ones that you got filled up after one small bowl. A few lobster meat which is fair. The taste was more real than artificial flavor. As an appetizer, I think it was a good start. The 8oz filet mignon was pretty good. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked as medium rare which I was very happy about. It came with a side of meshed potatoes and we also ordered a size of Brussels sprouts to share. We both think the Brussels sprouts was a bit too lemon juiced so the taste was overly sour. Last was the check cake. The restaurant week menu's dessert options was cheesecake or chocolate mousse. My boyfriend & I each order which. I liked the cheesecake a lot! ( prob my favourite part of the whole dinner) The base is made with cracker and nuts. The body of the cheesecake are very fluffy & light (very different from what you will get from Cheesecake Factory but don't get me wrong I love cheesecake factory's cheesecake! But those are very dense which I will not be able to finish the whole slice). The chocolate mousse was ok. If you are the kind who has a very strain sweet tooth then you might like the chocolate mousse over the cheesecake cause after I had a taste of the chocolate mousse I can't taste anything from the cheesecake and did need a sip of water to wash it out. Overall I think I would give it a 4 mostly b/c of the dessert and the service you get. But the entree was average. Prob would not go back if it is not restaurant week or might only gonna go back for just the cheesecake!> Randomly walked into this place.  We were offered immediate seating in a booth by the bar. The seating was great, very comfortable, perfect for people watching and two managers were walking to each table to check in.1. As you sit, you are offered Soft and warm sesame bread with butter on the side.Here's a list of what we ordered:-Shellfish plateau for 2 came with 3 pieces of shrimp, mango lobster chilled salad (no bueno, it was too sweet), 2 oysters, and lobster....as you could see it didn't come with crab claws.- Lobster Mac and cheese always on point and very cheesy.- For such a classy and expensive restaurant I would expect staff to cut and label my steak at table side.  Steak was soft, although I ordered medium well, was more on the well side. All the juice was by the bone and so was all the pepper...- the lamb was cut prior to being brought to the table and cooked medium well to perfection. - I was more impress by the huge bar, ambiance, wine rooms than the steak it self.> Went for restraunt week. My filet was burnt on the edges, dry inside, and just not impressive. Lobster bisque was ok. a little salty, not much flavor but small pieces of succulent lobster so thats a positive. Favorite thing was the strawberry cheesecake. Would pass on coming here again but the interior design was nice. Lovely velvet booths.> Worst service and lack of respect we have ever experienced. We got there 5 min before our reservation on a Wednesday night. There were two couples waiting to talk to the host and they got seated. The hostess was very dry, didn't ask anything so I said our names. She told us we would be seated in two minutes. While we waited we noticed that there were people seating at the bar but the restaurant was pretty empty. 20 minutes later, the hostess still haven't called us or talked to us at all. We decided to leave, politely told her and she just rolled her eyes and did say a word. No apologies for the delay, no offer for a glass of water, didn't say anything. Not sure what's the deal with them but it's certainly not getting my $$!","4, 4, 3, 2, 1"

I don't know how they did it...but the creators of the Impossible Burger and the Chefs here who put the toppings together went Balls to the Wahl!!! We stumbled on this burger by complete accident. And by 'we' I mean my dining companion, who's identity will continue to be shrouded in mystery, discovered this meatless wonder by failing to read the menu. Totally out of character for this carnivore...I asked several times if this is what they wanted and I was assured it was. I even asked that they read it back to me, which they did. And this is why I won't identify the person...after going over this 5 or so times, they still completely missed the PLANT PROTEIN mention *reading FAIL* I was low-key kind of happy cause I've always wanted to try this Impossible Burger, but not at my own expense, so I let them order w/ out saying a word...yeah I know, hell is HOT. I played it safe and stuck w/ the 'Our Burger' w/ Government Cheese, LMAO. I'll get it out of the way before getting to the good stuff and say yeah, this burger was good but very basic...I played it too safe. What I wanted to see was the reaction from the Impossible Burger. Was the jig going to be up on the first bite??? Was it going to really look and taste like a hamburger or some mystery grainy cornmeal patty??? The answer was yes and no. The jig was not up, the patty looked AND tasted like real meat!!! Even though I wasn't the one to order the faux meat, it didn't stop me from attempting to commandeer it. This burger has inspired me to purchase the patties semi regularly at places like Whole Foods. Service was not as good as the burgers and was served w/ somewhat of an attitude at times. All things considered, I'd highly recommend this burger joint and am salivating at just the thought of returning.> Had to come and try the spot! Honestly would of gotten a higher raTing but my CC information was jacked from here. So be warned and keep an eye out on your CC statement. Besides that incident the food it's self was good not greats. Don't bother ordering the Mac and cheese you can make better home from a box. The burgers were delicious, they add their flare to it which makes it nice.They do have a bar and quick service window compared to a sit dOwn area.> This place is a disaster. We stopped by at 1:30 on MLK day and ordered takeout -  2 burgers, tots and onion rings to go. The place wasn't busy but we still had to wait over 25 minutes for the place to mess up our order. Our order wasn't prepared to go even though we clarified with the staff twice that we wanted it to go. Also, why ask how you want our burgers cooked? Our burgers were so overcooked they were crunchy. Overall a terrible experience and huge waste of time. This place needs much better management and is definitely not worth it.> I've been here a couple times. Some days it's packed and others not so much but I haven't had to wait very long on my order. The portions have gotten smaller for some of the sides. The onions rings used to come in a basket like what the burgers were served in. The taters tots are about the same.I've ordered the super melt, which is really good minus how crusty the bread gets because it cuts the top of my mouth. Since that I've been getting it on a brioche bun.The Our Burger is the burger I order the most when I dine in.My favourite part of wahlburgers are the selections of the sides. Good Onion rings are hard to come by and I like how they do it. They have tater tots - regular and sweet potato. Also their pickles are really good.> Pros: The food was decent.  The atmosphere was fun if you like Markl Wahlberg.  Which I do. Cons: 1. Portions are small, 2. Drinks are small,3. The wait time is ridicules for a burger joint knowing that the place wasn't crowded. We waited for over 40 minutes for a couple of sandwiches 4. The service is bad, we had to wait for about 15 minutes before the server brought the menus, and another 10 minutes after that to take the orders, and about 40 minutes for the food to be served, and then 20 minutes to bring the check knowing that we asked for it several times, and the other waiter said that our server went out and she can't be found!  When they did bring our food, they messed up two of our 4 orders.","4, 2, 2, 4, 2"

Their family style menu is quite reasonable. I ordered takeout for Easter , and received a nice $5 gift card.Not sure when these awesome deals will expire, but this could be the silver lining in an otherwise awe full pandemic.> The Yard House is always good for a decent meal and cold beer. The onion rings are practically vegan with ""possible"" milk contamination which us likely in any kitchen. But they are oh so tasty. The music and sports shown just really make the meal more enjoyable! Love the many vegan options!Ok so we returned a few days later. Ordered a beyond sausage. Was told they would provide more sausage if one wasn't enough. At no additional cost.  Manager came out to talk to us to make sure all was well. This place is the best!!!!> Came here at 11:30 pm on Super Bowl Sunday. The place was nearly empty except for a small handful of tables, which was interesting to see since the restaurant is so large.My friend asked for a beer and the pint they served him was completely flat. Not a fun time...I guess they were running out of drink ingredients because people probably ordered a lot during the game. I tried asking for their new cocktail and they couldn't make it.I always feel a little weird reviewing chains... What I can say is this place is great for large parties and they have a huge drink selection. They have this tablet on each table that allows you to split the bill for each person, which is again great for large parties. The service is usually decent but not spectacular. The happy hour specials are a good deal. Sadly, they close at 12:30am so if you like late nights then I suggest visiting literally any other bar in Fenway which is guaranteed to be open later.> My friends and I came on a weekday evening for dinner. It wasn't crowded, so we were seated quickly. We ordered chicken nachos, angry orchard ciders, and a Margherita pizza to share. The chicken nachos were so delicious and the perfect size for three people to share! The ciders were delicious, as I expected. The Margherita pizza was pretty awful. It was very bland and tasted as if it were frozen pizza from a supermarket. The service was quick and efficient. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. Despite the pizza, everything tasted wonderful and we  had a good time! We'd come back for the nachos and cider!> Went here before a Red Sox game and the place was packed! They told us it would be a 25-35 minute wait when we arrived. After waiting quite a while, I checked in on our placement and the hostess said we had been waiting 40 minutes and we should be seated in another 10-20. I reminded her she had told us 25-35 initially and she said that they have a call ahead system that bumps those people up in like. This would have been very convenient to know about when we picked this restaurant! Make sure to call ahead on a game day! The food was, however, very good. The poke nachos were exceptional and on their 1/2 price happy hour menu! My husband and I split the steak and potatoes and other members got the salmon two different ways. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and ran off to put in our 1/2 price app order before 6 pm hit on their computers hit 6 pm","5, 4, 4, 3, 3"

Not only did they surprise the table with a bottle of champagne as it was our friend Elaine's birthday, they went way above and beyond in every aspect to make sure we were taken care of (putting the remainder of the birthday cake away during the game for safe keeping!) We started with the oysters and some sushi (mango tuna, another type of tuna roll that was incredibly fresh and an avocado ball) before moving on to the steak salad, bolognese, salmon and my boyfriend had a burger. The fries were absolutely delicious too!I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly!> Great pre-game fun.  Limited menu, but the food was good. Oysters were fresh and yummy.  Crab cakes, usually disappointing, were excellent.    Terrific and enthusiastice service, as well.  The place was almost empty and one of the servers showed us all around the upper level. Also, we had a view including the Bunker Hill monument, the masts of the Constitution, and the whole North End - beautiful.> Slam-dunk!If you go to see the Celtics or Bruins at the TD Garden and happen to get onto the Premium Club level, then consider saving some time and just have a great dinner inside the Garden.While the menu was limited, the dishes looked and tasted great. I opted for the short rib. It was unexpectedly covered in a glaze that had some blueberries in it. It was both sweet and tangy - blueberries?! I can tell you it was great. The short rib was set on some mashed potatoes that were great with the glaze.Think of Banners Harbor View as a swanky restaurant lodged in one of the best sports venues in New England.

One of the best place in Cambridge! Even though the food seems simple, but they have delicate flavors. Also they constantly add more seasonal options, which is great. The host is very knowledgeable about their wine selections. Good pair with the food> Beautiful and clean, prompt (but not overly chatty or friendly) service. Pretty empty on a weekday morning when I went in. Every single thing here is overpriced. I got the avocado toast, and, while flavorful and delicious was tiny (one small slice from a boule if you can imagine it) for the price and also on the saltier side. You're going to get a bigger serving literally anywhere. I also got the Hong Kong milk tea. I asked if it ""comes sweet"" and they said ""we can make it without sugar."" I said ""oh no I do want sugar"" but the milk tea that came out was also small, mildly sweet at best, kind of watery but also had a giant layer of foam on top. The place is small and while they bring your food out to you, they seem adamant about having customers pick up drinks. (There were 4 people working and only 4 patrons, so it wouldn't have been hard to walk drinks out to people?!) There are now way more options in the Kendall area than there used to be, and while it was an okay breakfast, I'd try somewhere else next time!> I continue to come here because it's so close to work. Today I came with 2 other friends to enjoy their happy hour, which is a glass of wine or beer with a free plate of mozzarella sticks. I got a glass of white (well I asked for red but I guess she didn't hear me?) and it came with two small mozzarella sticks. Each about the size of a finger, for a small hand. Overall still a good price for the area at about $9.50 per glass (with free app). Around 4:30pm it's not too busy, but started to get more busy around 5 or 5:15pm. There's a more extensive app list (including charcuterie board, nachos...) but none of that is up for grabs because the glass of wine comes with mozzarella sticks. And... so all 3 of us god mozzarella sticks. Even though a couple of us tried to 'trade in' for something that was equal or lesser value in apps, so we could at least try something else besides mozzarella sticks. The sticks were ok and nothing special. I heard they just started doing this special and I'm hoping they will expand to allow other 'free' app rotations so that a group of multiple people can experience an assortment, instead of... all the same dish :( Overall good experience, nice ambiance in the late afternoon after they cover up the glass windows with black drapes.> Big fan of this place! Everything is tasty and fresh.  My favorites are the breakfast sandwiches, but the salads and smoked salmon items are also delicious.  Very hip and trendy in both their atmosphere and menu selections> I came here before my doctor's appointment with hopes to have a quick bite and a delicious coffee. I ordered a cortado with oat milk and a kale salad (that comes with bacon). The salad was good- although I will say it was very basic which was surprising for this cafe. The cortado was delicious. I enjoyed the coffee quality a lot. I thought the cafe presentation was beautiful and the fancy idea to pour out glasses of waters for customers was thoughtful. The service was pleasant and friendly. I also did enjoy the interesting biotech conversations I was overheating near me. Since this cafe is right in the biotech center of Cambridge, this cafe is probably a regular hangout for workers and makes for a decent people watching spot haha I would come back here for a quick coffee and potential pastry if I was in the neighborhood.

Tried this place thanks to Caviar. Currently my sister's go-to delivery place specifically for Asian food. Meats are very flavorful, and don't require all the sauce that comes with it. I'd recommend getting sauces on the side. ALSO, highly, highly recommend the cheesy kimchi fried rice ball. Basically an Asian version of arancinis. Total comfort food. Perfect for a night spent in while social distancing.> This place hits the spot when you just want some good Korean fusion. It's not the best I've had (I'm spoiled, SF has the best), but it's decent. We all shared an OliToki Burrito with Bulgogi, Totchos with soy garlic chicken, and the classic wings with OliToki sauce. The burrito was bomb; it's got your meat, nice kimchi flavor, their sauce, yummm. The Totchos were also good, and they didn't skimp on the chicken. Personally, I thought the wings were the weakest part of the meal. They just didn't have that crunchy glaze reminiscent of Korean Fried Chicken, y'know?Price wise, its a little up there for what you get in my opinion. Like, you could definitely finish that $12 burrito in one sitting. So no leftovers for the next day. But the price wouldn't hinder me from ever coming back. Especially, since the Kimchi Fried Balls sounded good.> I read about OliToki online and was interested in trying it, but my fiancé has the taste palate of a 6 year old... so I was a little nervous. We both left full and unbelievably satisfied. They have something for everyone, no matter what they're looking for. I highly recommend this little treasure> Preface, I LOVE most Korean fusion, so I am biased.But this place is absolutely great - definitely try the totchos with your favourite type of protein. Crispy tater tots drowned in sauces, cheese, kimchi... What's more to want?!Seating is limited, however. They are usually pretty fast at takeout.> I was pretty excited about the possibility of getting some cheesy tofu quesadillas (or in this case, kimchi-dillas) and I adore everything kimchi, but this place didn't live up to the hype, sadly. My boyfriend and I were the only people in there, and still ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes for our takeout, which seemed pretty over the top to us. Our kimchi-dillas were very light on the cheese and dry, and even though I ordered mine extra spicy it was still super bland. Luckily the side aioli was good and helped give the quesadillas some flavor. That being said, the kimchi dumplings were good, and the food was served hot. There were other things on the menu that sounded interesting, and I'd be willing to try them if in the area, but I think I'll just be making my kimchi-dillas at home from now on.","4, 4, 5, 5, 3"

I got their Food Truck Fave and their Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The Food Truck Fave was a pretty large portion and had pulled pork. The pulled pork was really well seasoned and extremely tender. The sauce was also very good and complimented and brought together the entire meal. However, skip the Viet iced coffee - doesn't taste anything close to a real Viet iced coffee, it's more like a sad iced mocha.> They hopped on the Ritual bus! Use this app to order ahead and like Level Up, get rewards and discounts. My very first order with Bon Me through Ritual had a $2.55 discount. I also realized that they switched up their menu a bit. Gone is the Five Spiced chicken which was my go to protein of choice. I did however try their newer item this time, Gochujang chicken which is a spicy Korean chili paste. Paired with the sesame dressing over soba noodles and it was a treat! Great addition to the menu.> The food is good when you can get it, but if you have dietary restrictions, it's really not worth going to the trucks anymore. I'm vegan, and the truck in my neighborhood tends to run out of tofu early on in the lunch period. I understand that this happens sometimes, but in the past, it was much less frequent and they were much nicer about it. They would a) cross it off the menu on the side of the truck and b) offer to let you substitute in any of the vegan add-ons at no charge. At some point this changed, and nowadays you get to wait in line to find out that they don't actually have what's on the menu and that you're going to pay full price for a bowl with some rice and lettuce and a gaping hole in the middle that prompts the people preparing your food to ask if you're absolutely sure you don't want any protein.I tried submitting feedback suggesting that they bring back their friendlier policies on this, but they never responded to it, which I suppose is consistent with the new policies...  It's disappointing that their attitude has changed so much. I used to love the food and look forward to visiting the truck every week.","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

I have had tacos from Los Angeles and Mexico, so you cannot expect me to say these tacos are on the same level. Affordable, yes. Authentic, no. Customer service, none! The lady who took my order was rude actually. I asked what seems to be popular here and she rolled her eyes before answering me. Lady, if I knew, I wouldn't have asked you... mind you, this was my first time coming here and every place is different. You order your food at the counter and pay. Then when your food is ready, you go back to the counter to literally get your own food to bring your table if you're dining in. It is similar to ordering at Chipotle, which I do like for a fast food place but that is a different yelp post. Overall, this place is okay.> A M A Z I N G.This place looks like nothing special from the outside, yet let me say that the food will blow your taste buds away. Great burritos and guac.If you are looking for a fancy Mexican place with tequila opt out of this little joint.HOWEVER if you are looking for amazingly fresh authentic Mexican for an affordable price stop in here. No waiter service, you order at the counter and you are on your way.> The almost perfect 5 star rating that Tenoch has really speaks for itself. The tacos are amazing and the service is always great as well. Tenoch has managed to make a name for itself as a Mexican restaurant in the North End - that's not easy to do! Plenty of others have tried, and failed. This is the go-to Mexican spot in the North End and that's not changing anytime soon. 5/5 I recommend this place to everyone.> Great tacos in north end.

Would never have known if it weren't for the deal buy one get one pizza. Have come by a couple times time and must say Vodka Classic and Vanessa's Pesto are my personal favorites as they're the ones I feel you can't find anywhere else.Vodka classic seems to be an elevated margherita but just surpasses it. It is made with vodka sauce and then topped off with fresh basil, prosciutto, and cheese. Really great option if you're looking to step away from just a traditional margherita and looking for that little extra something. A bit more though I'd say I prefer the Vanessa's Pesto. Though I usually prefer a traditional red sauce on pizza this one is a major mind changer with the pesto! The pesto base is then layered with cheese, grilled chicken, and caramelized onions. Only thing I will say is that the first time the ratio of ingredients was just perfect, second time however they went a bit heavy on the onions (easily picked off though). In any case, great flavors, many many options making it the perfect pizza for a night in.> Came in on a Sunday nigHt and  was happy to find gluten free pasta on the menu. They even know to use separate pots for cooking  the pasta. Ordered the bologna sauce with a side of sautéed broccoli. It was all fabulous. I enjoyed my meal and had some left overs to take home. The restaurant isn't fancy or trending to the hip crowd. It was baseball caps, sweaT shirts and jeans  for the most part throughout the restaurant. I'd come back for more and don't make it into the north end  area often but when I do, it's always enjoyable. Happy I found this place.> Best way to spend a chilly afternoon, eating good food in a cozy place! Had an amazing crispy stone wood fried pizza with great toppings. Many options for vegetarian toppings as well. Also had a pesto pasta which had one of the best pesto i have tasted.> Best take out I had in awhile. Usually take out isn't as good as dine in, but this restaurant was good! The fusilli carbonara was delicious. Fusilli pasta tasted fresh and soft combined with the creamy rich carbonara sauce. The pizza was great as well! It was thin crust and just the right blend of red sauce with cheese. Will definitely order from here again.> A decent find in the North End.  I came here on a Thursday night with a party of 7 and we were seated quickly without a reservation.  TIP:   whatever pasta sauce you order can be served with any noodle type.  The gnocchi, ravioli, and fusilli are made in house from scratch.  Many people in our party chose one of these with their pasta sauce, but beware there is a $7 up charge.  Our waiter didn't notify us of this which was frustrating. We started with the fried calamari.  Key main dishes from the night include the carbonara, lobster ravioli, and short rib truffle rigatoni.  The pesto was good but VERY VERY oily.  They have an extensive wine menu and it's worth splitting a bottle if you're with a larger party.  The serving sizes are large and the food comes out hot. However, it is a bit pricey compared to what you can get at other restaurants in the North End.","5, 4, 5, 5, 3"

Can't wait to go back for more!!> I keep coming back here because I'm intrigued by the menu... I've tried the Jazz Wrap around 9.50 being the total, the Resolution being around 8.50, and the Mac and cheese side for 4.99. This place does a fantastic job with creating unique and creative wraps that are vegan and vegetarian. The Jazz Wrap was delicious, although it was a little too salty. It was good, but I'm not sure if I would order it again. The Resolution was surprisingly good. The ingredients on the menu seemed bland and boring and just filled with a bunch of greens and shredded carrots, but it was actually so refreshing and yummy! They added the perfect amount of hummus to make it enjoyable to eat. The Mac and cheese was pretty mediocre. I think if there was a place to grow, this would be it! It would be epic to have a delicious Mac and cheese to accompany your meal (option for regular Mac or Vegan Mac for an extra $2). My friend got the Fire wrap and it had a really nice spicy flavor to it. I stole a bite from hers and I think I might try that one next! As for customer service, it's pretty slow. My friends and I waited for about 20+ minutes for our wraps and they were togo. Other than that, I truly do love this little place on the corner of commonwealth avenue!> I got the fire and my partner got the ballpark. It was shocking how our two wraps were so different. Mine I thought was great and ate it all (but was still hungry, so we probably should have gotten fries, looking at the reviews I guess they're really good) His however was burnt to a crisp and a mixture of hot and cold (while mine was all warm). He didn't finish his so I ate the rest of it and was shocked at the difference. Consistency is key and they're not hitting it.> Great food, I love the drumsticks and waffles! I came here with a friend for brunch and was very happy with what I got. I took off one star for the brunch DJ. He started off playing very loud and obtrusive music but eventually turned it down.> I don't know how this place got ANY stars! The food was skimpy and horrible! I got a bean burrito, supposed to have rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce and sauce- it was stuffed with bland dry tasteless rice, spoon full of kidney beans, and nothing. I couldn't even swallow the first bite. My son's Impossible Burger tasted ok but it was super small and flat with nothing on it. And the milkshake was tiny and tasteless!

Overall, a real gem of a place that needs to be supported by the community at large.  Come here and give them your money (and get delicious delicious food).> I've had lunch from here a few times, the sandwiches were good, but nothing to write home about. I also thought they were expensive for what they were, simple subs. Recently, I had their yahoo breakfast sandwich. It's a filling sandwich and different from the ones offered at other restaurants downtown. The Portuguese muffin and the hash brown make it a unique option. It was really delicious and satisfying. Come here for breakfast!> I've since moved from Boston, but I still often think about their Yahoo Sandwich... that's how good it is. Their addition of a hashbrown to a classic bacon, egg, and cheese just takes it to a level that's unmatched. Service is quick, perfect spot to get your breakfast sandwich to go.> Stopped by a local place close to the hotel to grab breakfast. Got the Yahoo, which was delicious and simple - Portuguese muffin with egg, white American cheese, hash brown, and sausage. Staff were nice and quick. Not much seating as it seems like many people were picking up food to go. It seemed busy as people were constantly coming in for lunch orders.

Their falafels are the best falafels I've ever had. Chicken and rice plate with tzaziki sauce. So good> Good:1. The falafel is really good here. Really crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. It's a tad more flavorful than other falafel I've had around the city (maybe a bit more garlic-y). They give you one while you wait too.2. The rice was surprisingly really tasty too. It was well seasoned and the texture was soft with bits of thin noodles throughout. I couldn't stop gorging myself on it.3. The portions here are generous and at an affordable price too. For 1 kebab dinner plate you get a healthy serving of rice, 2 kebabs, a side salad, and a (pre-packaged) serving of a flour wrap.Average:1. Sister and I shared one chicken kabab plate and one lamb kebab plate. Both were just ok, nothing special. We both agreed the chicken was better than the lamb (which was a bit under seasoned). Both were cooked well though maintaining a soft and juicy texture. 2. The side salad was as simple as you can get. Classic fast food greens with a quick drizzle of dressing. Fine for just adding a bit of freshness and variety to the plate.Final thoughts:Come here for the really good falafel or a filling meal that won't make your wallet cry.> Stopped in as I was walking The Freedom Trail.  I was pleased and surprised at how good the food is.The greet you with a falafel and hummus, which was nice.  Had the mixed plate of chicken and meat.  It was quite tasty.  Only thing I wish they had is a spicy hummus.  Their hummus is good, but spicy would turn it up a notch.I will eat here again.> Visited on a weekday afternoon for lunch in December 2018. Pretty decent sized restaurant for a typical take out spot but I decided to take my order and sit in. It was really busy during lunch time but despite of that people at the counter were polite in preparing and serving my order. Food was served hot and tasted really good especially their hummus and falafel.Beef and Lamb Shawarma Meat plate with Rice, Hummus, Falafel and Salad> If you've ever dined at Amelias tacqueria on Huntington this will remind you a bit of it except they temper it with a free falafel while you order. Ordered a falafel hummus combo wrap, it was supposed to come with tabouli but I didn't get any. Be vocal folks.If you order online notice how a combo roll-up w/ falafel is $8.75, combo roll-up falafel/hummus/tabouli is $8.35, falafel vegetarian roll up is $7.85. What are the differences? Why is straight up falafel more expensive and what makes that a combo? How many falafel do they include in each roll-up then?Anyways, it's downtown Boston so eating out is expected to be expensive...

Salad was HUGE, which I appreciated; great salad too--lots of tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled onions, so I felt like I was getting a huge helping of veggies. Reason I only gave 3 stars was because the burger I ordered, medium, was served rare in the middle. The waiter was great, offering to take it off the bill; the manager (Zack?) came over and apologized profusely, and offered to have the kitchen make something else, but since I needed to catch my next flight I declined. The manager took care of the entire bill, (though I did offer to pay for my side salad and coke). I would absolutely give this restaurant another try, since their service was spot on--everybody has off days.

I feel the need to balance the scale -- I stopped here randomly in the terminal gate and was pleasantly surprised. Service was attentive from start to finish despite the many full tables, and the food is on-par with typical airport (ordered a caesar and garlic bread accompanied by a cheaper merlot).No major complaints here.> It did the trick....  Layover to LA and having just off a flight from DC. One was hungry. There's was a few eatery between arrival and departure gate. But all seen more of a quick bite or to go. I had two hours to spare and seeing when we walked by earlier, it was pretty busy. Normally means it's good or a happening place. It didn't take long for us to get seated, though there was one other table available. The wine menu had an ok selection. But the one we wanted wasn't available upon ordering. Waitress was friendly, but seemed like she was the only one working taking orders for the whole place. Did see maybe one or two guys brining out food. Opted for something that's easy to share and not a meal. As some of the dishes that were coming out didn't look appetizing. First off, ordered calamari, but again. They were out just like wine. Swapped it for a the risotto balls. Also had the flatbread and a side of Parmesan fries. It didn't take that long for food to arrive. Fries came with ketchup but server asked if we needed anything else. I asked for blue cheese dressing for the fires, nope they don't have it. Then asked for ranch, didn't have that either. Wow, no ranch or blue cheese at the restaurant. Oh well. Food was ok, it did the trick.Our waitress, the only one working was perky and friendly. Having to basically run the whole place to herself.> It was probably very weird for the kitchen to cook a rare lamb burger, the the first one came out well done  lucky I had a great bartender, Diane, who noticed right away and send it back! Once the rate one came out...what can I say, absolutely amazing!!! And this menu looks much better then the other locations too...but totally willing to give a chance to the North End location one next time!> I always look for local spots when traveling. Local vs chain will win for me, so luckily Boston's Lucca expanded to the airport.Obviously, I love that it's local. This includes the drink list. Bantam Cider and Nightshift Brewing are a delight to see. I'd love to see more snack-able menu offerings. I've had the flatbread, which can feed a few. The minestrone was good but still on the larger side. More smaller bites would be ideal.The service perhaps mimics local. One of the employees (maybe a manager) called me by my name after I settled up, and said I should visit again. Airport restaurants see so many faces regularly, so I shouldn't feel excited, but I think the local charm within was calling. Terminal B is getting a reboot. I'm excited that have Lucca as a new part of it.","3, 5, 4, 5, 4"

I had the pretzel (which was decent) and chicken sandwich dinner (quite spicy). Other people in our group got pizzas and wraps, which they enjoyed.Service started well, but got slower and slower throughout the night. Also disappointing was the restaurant ran out of deserts, had no candles for my birthday, and simply brought out a cookie and said happy birthday. Kinda lame! Would go back in the future, likely for just drinks though. 3/5 overall.> Not a bad spot! We stopped in for a quick cocktail before heading out of town via the Amtrak station.

The cheese board is very customizable - just let your waiter know what types of cheeses you like / dislike and you'll get some highly recommended options. The Baked Brie was super heavy on the preserves and more reminiscent of a danish than anything. The crab cake was decent, and not large enough!

All I know is that you should go to Angela's right now and order anything on the menu other than the chilaquiles (Guy Fieri is a moron).> First stop from the airport was this cozy spot! We wanted a great breakfast that had both savory and sweet options and Angela's was just the ticket! Bonus: all dine-in breakfasts come with coffee! I ordered the French toast with seasonal fruits and caramel sauce. I originally asked for the sauce on the side, but after tasting it, realized I had to pour it over everything! It was very much like dulce de leche and added depth to an otherwise-lackluster breakfast. My husband ordered the chilaquiles with red sauce and despite my hatred of eggs, my mouth was watering at the smell. Crispy tortillas, meat of your choice, beans, and eggs cooked your way smothered in a delicious sauce and it was completely perfect. Prices were good, service was excellent, and atmosphere was cozy! If you are going--stick with the traditional Mexican breakfast and you will be begging for more!> This place is starting to become the beau and I's regular spot for brunch. I love it here. It's a really cute, cozy, and intimate little restaurant. There's always a wait but we have never wait longer than 30mins. The owner is very personal and nice. Coffee is not bad at all. Eggs Florentine is pretty good BUT. They are known for their chilaquiles. We get it Everytime we are here. Everyone comes here for it. Not too spicy, full of flavors, and lots of protein.

Brunch!This small restaurant serves meals that are packed with huge flavor.  We got to brunch around 10 am and I wasn't hungry until ~5 pm that day. The portions are huge! Pro tip- make sure to ask for a bottle of hot sauce for the table. It's a green chili based sauce that makes everything taste even better! I tried the Huevos Poblanos which comes with refried beans, scrambled eggs with ham and poblanos, seasoned pita, avocado, and corn tortillas.

I'd say the pancake was not the best I couldn't eat them all, it was really dry.The waitress who took care of me was super slow, I asked for my water twice, I tried to understand that she might busy but she went to tables around me twice but never stop at mine.I decided to take my hot chocolate for to go, I could notice that she forgot about me, again. At the end when she dropped my check and to go cup for my hot chocolate, she poured my hot chocolate into my to go cup and at the end her long nail scoop some of my hot chocolate she didn't notice anything because she was talking to people at another table, I felt like I was a ghost at the place, totally different feeling compare with my YESTERDAY visit ....I was crying inside and decided to not take my hot chocolate away.Please... I'm working in a restaurant too, please cut your nail or at least look at the cup/bowl and make sure you didn't put anything extra.","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

But then there are places like this. Instant classics.I'm by no means an authority on jerk chicken, so let me just tell you this: Juicy chicken with deliciously crisp skin and penetrated by the spicy hot jerk seasoning. So good! Sides were excellent as well. I had rice and beans (with a good scoop of jerk sauce over it) and nicely crunchy stir-fries. cabbage and carrots. Can't wait to go back!> This restaurant will have your taste buds dancing and screaming for more. A friend suggested I come here and I was not disappointed. The meat was tender and full of flavor. Many hats off to the cook. The jerk chicken was so fresh and flavorful I thought I was in Jamaica for a hot second. They give you more than your money's worth. When I saw my plate my eyes lit up because it was a good amount of food. The customer service was great quality, the employees were able to answer my questions about certain food which showed me that they care. Overall this place is a must, thank me later for the recommendation!Food: 5 Customer service: 5> Really good food actually better than half the boston carribean restaurants flavor/ taste wise.. Not a long wait time.. Best fried goat  i've had in a while. Pikliz was delicious..> The food here was delicious. Not only was it full of flavor the amount you get for the cost was great. I had enough to eat for lunch and dinner. I'm happy to see a great Haitain restaurant in the community. I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes they offer.> Small take out place with a hot bar (not self serve). I don't know if I recall a large eat in area but there may be a few tables to dine in. I came here on a late Friday night and unfortunately ran out of a lot the items I wanted to try. So I went for the coconut chicken, side of the jerk chicken with coconut ride and a side of slaw. Both chicken was so tender and flavorful. The jerk chicken had a nice crispy skin with a kick to it which I enjoyed better than the coconut chicken. The coconut rice wasn't too fragrant of coconut but cooked well. I'm definitely going back to try the black rice and oxtail next time!","5, 5, 4, 5, 4"

I ended up with the non alcoholic pairing. I honestly didn't want the pairing, but was forced to get it since there was no option to exclude it from my reservation.  The crab ""cake"" with pickled beets mushroom and mascarpone was delicious! Savory yet refreshing in texture and taste.The harimasa tartare torte was satisfyingly in its crunchy texture and fresh fish taste.The foie gras in the macaron was divine! It hit the tspot in full force!! The texture of the macaron was a bit gummy. Perhaps too much xantham gum?? Its forgivable with the delicious foie gras taste.The langoustine dish transported me to a cold winter seafront that playful takes local ingredients and superimposes a japanese vibe without being obvious. The use of apple in this dish further enhances a sweet yet refreshing profile. The toasted rice vinegar was a wonderful contrast of a dark low tone that still comes off light like an old man dipping tea by his winterside window.The harimasa dish was a wonderful two punch combo of lemon and eggplant. The yuzu koshu was just enough to feel like an alley hoop, followed by the slam dunk of the pine lemonade. I love the liquid presence of a nut in this pairing!!The gremolata dumplings dish was a symphony of flavors that stimulated my mind, satisfied my tongue, and comforted my soul. Light in texture, while firm in its sensual profile. Like a multi layered platform, overarching and overlapping in structure and form, the familiar lemon and garlic, tossed in a delicious sour cream, engulfed by a literal cloud of uni foam - this was heavenly.The branzidino looks like it was dressed like pepto bismal, but its actually purple radish. Its the more adventurous aspect of the meal, where some people may be taken back by the sour pickled flavors. This wasnt my favorite, but the fish was cooked just right. Also the drink pairing of apple and thyme vinegar was delicious!!The trout dish was like no preparation of trout ive seen. The best way i could describe it is a northern take on pimento cheese and Chipotle peppers. Low toned, slighty astringent, and funk thats not sharp but hangs like fog. In a strange way, a mild cranberry is a kindred spirit. The hibiscus and smoked maple syrup tonic was an amazing combo that stretches the horizon of this dish. This dish wins me over for such an unusual presentation that speaks my imagination and peaks my curiosity.The squab was solid. Although I would have liked for the texture be c cooked just slightly more, the compromise of a bloody robust punch of the squab is delightful. What really took me by surprise was the squash piece on the backend. Its as if the squash looked at itself in the mirror and saw a reflection of the squab. The squab smiles menacingly as it takes it hooks its talons into the squash to transform it slowly into a squab!! The squab pate crumbles at its foot side hit the t-spot! The lemon ginger drink was ok but I get it was suppose to contrast.The venison dish was a homerun. What a great way to end the savory dishes. The combination of flavors seem odd but end up working well. The acorn puree really hit it home with its fermented power, harnessing this woodsy feel along with a heartiness I would get from a squash. The chef masterfully infuses chocolate into this dish, honing in on the earthy, acidic nuttiness of the cacao bean, while feeling sultry as a chocolate liquor at times. The cranberries were a great choice, further enhancing the chocolate notes, as well as the ""north American"" foraged feel.The lettuce sorbet was a sight to behold, as it pulls off what I couldn't do at home myself: take lettuce and make it into ice cream. I wonder if this place as a pacojet, cause otherwise I don't see how they masterfully removed all the fiber and grit of lettuce for this ice cream. Earthy and ""green"", while still being a sweet, creamy custard ice cream. The cucumber celery granita felt like a drink I would receive from a juice counter at the health food store. The main dessert was quite fascinating in its overall approach. Rather than using chocolates, caramels, or super sweet fruits, the chef here concocts a dessert that seems quite different yet familiar. A pastry puff, with a separate side of ice cream and sauce on the surface, but a beautiful marriage between all three. The hibiscus has the right amount of sweetness to elevate, yet not feel overwhelming. The herbal quality ties well with the pear and rhubarb. The goats milk offers the necessary tang while being easier to digest on the stomach. Everything about this was so satisfying!This is one of those places where it feels like the big leagues, yet the head chef is so humble and nonchalant. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you book this first over any other restaurant in town.> Tasting Counter is so far ahead of the curve that it's hard to know where to begin. The somewhat pedestrian name does little to reveal the many wonders that Peter Ungár and his team have created, but the unassuming frankness is a refreshing trait that extends throughout the meal.For $250 all-in, you get 12 courses comprising one of the finest meals you can find in this part of the country. The food at Tasting Counter isn't so much  about rapid-fire seasonality as it is exploring each storied ingredient to its fullest, often in surprising ways. Lobster broth will be gently foamed and infused with Uni to create an effect not unlike pure umami injected directly into your veins. Kuri Squash will provide a formidable partner to its delicate partner in Peking Duck-styled Squab. Rest assured that every experiment thrown your way is delicious from first bite to last. My personal favorite of the evening was a preparation of Nantucket Bay Scallop, Salsify, and Chestnut blanketed in a torched Tonka Bean Custard that was breathtakingly good.If you drink, go with the wine pairing. The natural wine selection looked fantastic and was so lovingly explained that it was often competing with the food for attention. I went for the juice pairing, which was great but a bit heavy on the fermentation and vinegar for my liking. By the end I felt like I was drowning in Beet Kombucha, and would have preferred something a bit lighter and more refreshing. Tasting Counter may not have the Old World class you might expect at this price point, perhaps to its benefit, but there's no question that Ungár has cemented the start of a very promising legacy right here in Boston.> Tasting Counter has been on my list for a long time. I added it when I found out guests were able to watch the chefs prep some of the food and plate it right in front of you - that was an experience I hadn't had before (until I went to Table at Season to Taste). My husband and I were lucky enough to be treated to lunch this past Saturday by friends who were thanking us for our help with their recent move. (An amazing way to celebrate a friend or say thank you, btw)! The seating is all pre-planned, so when the host or hostess seats you, you get seated where they decide you should go. (Given that the seating is very limited, this makes sense). They are also diligent about food restrictions and allergies, and mark the counter where you are seated so that all the chefs preparing the food are aware if you are seafood averse, dairy free, gluten free, etc.My husband was not eating seafood for this lunch, so there were a few dishes that he got that were, quite honestly, far better than ours. The lobster dumplings we got were tasty, but his gremolata dumplings legitimately stole the show. We all sampled a little bit, and had SERIOUS food envy. The flavor was like nothing else! We also enjoyed the foie gras macarons.The reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because this experience felt quite rushed. I can't imagine being at the 12pm seating, since our seating began right at 1pm and everyone from that seating had to make room for us to come in. We ended around 2:10 or 2:15, so we had extra time, and I don't know what we would have done without it! (I assume the dinner seatings may be a bit less hurried with 2 hours of time allotted, but they also have more courses).The food with the wine pairings was hard to fully enjoy because you couldn't take your time. There were a few times I had to sort of ""chug"" my wine because more had already arrived. Also, when we were completely finished with our meals, there were people still eating, but the chefs and waitstaff were cleaning up all around them, so I think they might have needed to finish up quickly. All in all, a great meal and I enjoyed the whole experience. I'd definitely come back if I needed a place to celebrate something really special, or impress an out-of-towner with fancy tastes.> Lunch here was divine. Each dish was so creative from the welcoming bites (see pics)to the herby ice cream at the end with the moist olive oil cake and crisp pizzelle .Our fave was the lobster dumplings with uni cream. There was also a trout dish with creamed vegetables that surprisingly had no cream and a hazelnut crunch, and dessert mentioned above. The closing bites were also intriguing. A peppery chew, bonbon, and mini canelle was served. The peppery chew was my favorite as it was great to cut through the sweetness of the bonbon. Each course had a wine pairing which was included in our ticket price of $85.Service was impeccable and each plate was presented well. To be able to see the chefs working and garnishing makes this an entertaining dining experience! At the end of the meal I was happily full despite what seems like small portions.> I had high expectations of Tasting Counter based on customer reviews and all the press, but I found the experience surprisingly disappointing.ONLINE TICKETING INPUTS DID NOT TAILOR THE PRODUCTION OF ANY OF OUR DISHES- I had pre-paid for tickets/reservations on the website -- taking time to fill out their forms noting the occasion we were celebrating, as well as dietary restrictions and food preferences.-  While the website touts the online ticketing system and its ability to keep track of food allergies, restrictions and preferences -- there was no acknowledgment of those things when we arrived or as we were given menus.- For my first course, I had to request a modification based on my dietary restriction. For my second course, they also ended up replating it since it didn't take into my dietary restrictions. - We were there on a Monday night, and there was only one other couple there when we arrived. So there was ample space and time to tend to our reservation and food notations.SERVICE WAS ODD, COLD & DISJOINTED- From the moment we walked in, it was strange. A woman was sitting near the entrance, at a computer, but she didn't get up when we walked in. So we found our way into the dining area on our own. - After standing around for a moment, a guy came out from behind the food counter and we gave him the name on our reservation. He seated us. - We were given a prix fixe menu to choose from. It was very cut and dry. ATMOSPHERE WAS FLAT AND LACKED ENERY- The chefs inside the counter looked or acted nothing like the ones in the Google photos wearing white chef coats and hats. They each wore different versions of black, one in a jacket and one in a polo type shirt. They moved quietly and methodically, almost robot like. They were focused, but didn't appear to be enjoying what they were doing. That's how it felt to me anyway. - Later in the evening, the woman who had been sitting by the computer up front came and joined them inside the counter, helping with plating. She wore a floppy fuzzy sweater and had dissheveled hair, and she kept pushing her sleeves up with her hands while she was prepping. For some reason, it struck me as unprofessional and not very sanitary.FOOD WAS WELL-PRESENTED AND INVENTIVEThe food was by far the best part of the night. While I was a little surprised that I wasn't asked how I preferred my lamb loin cooked, it was perfectly medium rare. The desserts were delicious and The appeal of a Michelin calibre menu was a big draw for me to Tasting Counter, but the service didn't deliver on a top-notch experience. I probably wouldn't go back.","5, 5, 4, 4, 3"

I ordered the homemade Carbonara and I'll be revisiting that dish in my dreams over the next few weeks. Why stray to the overhyped tourist spots when you have this hidden gem!> I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate an occasion for dinner. Most of the North End restaurants had a 2+ hour wait or were not accepting any new customers. He found this place with no wait and grabbed a table while I was on my way from work.He ordered tomato gnocchi and asked to make it spicy, which was no problem for the chef. I tried a few bites and it was delicious and very spicy per his request. I ordered the ravioli, which was filling and slightly unique tasting. It was plain cheese filled, but I detected a bit of nuttiness and a drier cheese inside, which was a nice change of pace. For the price for both of our entrees, mine was on the smaller side and my boyfriend's was average.They also give a bread basket (good bread, nothing spectacular) with butter; we asked for olive oil the first time and balsamic on the second refill. It took a while to get the second refill, but we weren't in a rush. I had a tiramisu for dessert (which was actually larger than I expected), which was also good.Service was fine; our water glasses never went empty and our bread basket got refilled once. I do have to say it was a bit slow toward the end of our meal. We waited close to 15 minutes for the check, and there were more busboys/waiters than full tables. The best part about the service was that our waiter was HILARIOUS and quirky; he kept us laughing/entertained all night. It is very intimate in here (I think this used to be a frozen yogurt shop a long time ago), so beware if you aren't a fan of small places. We could hear the conversations of all the groups around us, which didn't bother us, but I could see how someone else might be claustrophobic. The tables can easily be pulled apart/combined to accommodate party sizes, though!Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again unless someone else in my party wanted to. I thought it was a bit expensive considering I wasn't in love with it. Don't get me wrong, it was GOOD FOOD, just not the best I've had in the North End for the price.> It was a really wonderful family dinner tonight with the best service from Justin. Love lil Italy Boston. North End is absolutely the place to find that perfect Italian meal. Everyone damn near cleaned their plates. Even dessert too! We ordered veal, lamb, lobster ravioli, parpadelle alfredo, scallops over risotto and cod over risotto. I got a taste of almost everything. I'm getting too ahead of myself. First off the basket of bread was so good. Started with that. Warm and soft on the inside made to not have just one. I had three. An appetizer, the fried calamari with the red sauce with lemon was delicious too. Lightly battered, not chewy. I just got back into eating seafood from being vegan. It was flavored really well. So then our main dishes came out. The lobster ravioli was warm, covered in thick white sauce,ravioli al dente filled with chunky pieces of lobster. If you are into alfredo though, the parpadelle will probably be the best dish you've ever had. It does not disappoint. And the cod, oh my goodness. I would totally go back for their cod. Those were my favorite from my first visit. Cannoli and caramel flan was a very nice ending. We got lucky with this spot tonight. I called last minute. No reservation, just showed up, and got sat down with a party of 7. They don't seat you unless the entire party is there. Smallest little spot at the back corner with an intimate view of the back office watching servers walk pass holding fabulous Italian dishes, black curtain flying in and out. Great view of the street of Hanover on a Saturday night. Fantastic company. Food I can say was more than satisfying.> Enjoyed a wonderful dinner at this lovely, little restaurant. Plentiful portions of delicious food. Attentive, friendly service. The Caramel Custard may be the best dessert I've ever eaten.> On a Saturday night, there is a reason as to why there are ridiculous lines out the door for two of the restaurants in Boston's North End and why it was so easy to get a table at Casarecce. Like most restaurants in the North End, Casarecce is small and cozy. It was just unfortunate that we got seated right next to the kitchen so it was a little awkward to look to our left and see the servers hiding back there to cut the cold pieces of complimentary bread. So yes, the bread was cold and unimpressive. The olive oil was brought out in a black, plastic, to-go condiment container with nothing else in it. Usually restaurants will add black pepper or their own blend of herbs and spices but nope, this was just plain olive oil. My sister got the Pappardelle Alfredo and while she said it tasted okay, it was just a little sad to see that it was a small plate of pasta for $20. I usually like to try other people's pasta dishes because there's usually enough but I felt bad if I were to take one bite of her dish. My boyfriend's spaghetti & meatballs were unimpressive. The texture of the meatballs was a little too gritty for our liking. The sauce was not great either and a bit tart for our liking. He dumped a whole bunch of parmesan cheese onto it to amp it up. I have mixed feelings about my cod puttanesca. The cod was absolutely delicious and cooked so perfectly. The tomato sauce that was on it didn't do anything to help it so I ended up scraping it off. The theme of the day was ""super tart"" so my tomato sauce was too tart for me. That in combination with the super salty anchovies was blah. The pasta that it came with I barely touched as well because I wasn't into the taste. Pros for Casarecce? You'll get seated quickly and they accept credit card unlike the other well-known North End establishments. You'll also finish your meal quickly because the portions aren't that big. Will we be back? Probably not.","5, 3, 4, 5, 3"

The food is exceptionally delicious and as authentic as can be for Greek. The best part of the experience is the service and atmosphere it provides; very welcoming and attentive servers and staff. We had a wonderful experience and its somewhere I can see us returning over and over again (maybe even with a larger crowd.)> Stopped by here for a quick lunch after seeing the majority positive Yelp reviews. Now I can add to the positivity. Food was cooked fresh, flavorful, and the portions/price were not too shabby as well (although $17 for the octopus appetizer was bit excessive--I don't regret ordering it as a main meal). The food overall was exactly what I hoped for--flavorful Greek such as charred chicken, lemon, and creamy tzatziki! They also bring out a basket of nice chewy bread at the beginning. As for the rest of the menu, they have it all from gyros to salads to dips and anything else you're hoping for from a Greek restaurant--I want to get the Saganaki next time! I was surprised by how packed it was during lunch hour for this sit down restaurant. It seems to attract a local crowd consisting of residents and business people, meaning they have efficient and quick service! It's definitely a solid Greek restaurant where I hope to return soon!> The food was very good! A little expensive for the quantity, but definitely worth it.Dolmades (10$) were amazing! It was so flavorful and the texture was amazing. Usually I don't like the texture of the wrapper, but this one was so tender. The sauce was also very well balanced in lemon flavor.Eggplant salad (10$) was not bad, but very strongly flavored.Octopus (18$) was sooooo good. I've never had octopus with a nearly meaty texture, so it was very interesting! Slightly too salty and definitely pricey, but worth it.Shrimp kebab (18$) was average in flavor unfortunately. The feta on salad (75c) was really good, though the additional price seems not worth it. I had the okra for a side, and it was very tasty.> This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants. We usually go there for their seafood and have always been happy with the freshness of the sea food we ordered. Their staff is very friendly and the place is super clean. If you are craving for a European sea bass then you must check this place out. Oh and also do not forget to taste their hand cut fries with feta cheese on them  if you like octopus which is also something my friends save about in this place.> We liked this restaurant enough to be huge fans.Having been to Athens, we're pretty familiar with Greek cuisine.  Desfina met our needs for Greek food in Boston, and we recommend it highly.Why did I deduct a star?  Based on value, mainly.  We ate at 4:30 pm, early birds, the place was empty, on a Thursday.  We paid full menu price, no specials offered.Comparatively, we were able to get outstanding Italian food in North End and early bird specials at a better price, with salads, dessert, and wine included, M-F.I guess it's all about competition.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

I've never dined in here, but as far as takeout goes, I'd give it two thumbs up.> I ordered delivery and left my phone number for them to call when they get to my complex because it's hard to navigate around the place. A hour and a half goes by and I hear nothing so I call and they told me that they couldn't find my complex so they had their driver go back to the restaurant and take other deliveries. They said they will have the driver come right back and bring my order again. Another 45 minutes go buy still nothing, so I call again and they proceeded to blame the new driver and told me I can keep waiting, so I just cancelled the order.> This place is fantastic, consistently delicious and cheap.

The food is cheap (especially at lunch), is of decent quality and large portions. I came back after they reopened recently, and they're just as good as I remember! Usually, I order either the beef & broccoli or the chicken & eggplant when I eat in. When I take out, I usually get the beef and chinese broccoli chinatown plate, because I think the chinatown plates are more value when ordering to go. The food is also better and the quantity is larger if you eat in, so I would definitely recommend that! I'm definitely going to be coming back again :).","5, 1, 5, 1, 4"

It's a very small diner though, so seating is limited. It's usually packed on a Saturday/Sunday early morning, so be prepared to stand outside in a long line. Thankfully they have a heater though which makes it slightly more bearable in the freezing cold winter months. Not many places opened 24 hours and it will show with the amount of people in line waiting for a seat. Definitely quieter with less people throughout the week. Waitstaff for the most part are friendly minus a few select ones and cooks are efficient! Have only ever ordered the breakfast food, usually the diner combo but will update my review once I try some other things on the menu.> The employee messaged me requesting I not say anything online about poor service after giving a 50/50 review and claiming she did NOT cough in my face. The fact that you were oblivious to doing it the night of in question, means I have no faith or expect you to realize that you did it 15 days later down the road. I am not writing a fake review.

However the owner/employee needs to understand this is the social media age. I can blast on facebook, instagram, wherever I want. So can anyone else. People use yelp for dining advice ans I felt it very important to let them know that yes, the food is great. But my customer service was sub-par due to a sick female employee coming around the booth, coughing in my face and going ""can i take your order?"" And then coughing behind the counter as she handled plates holding food. The message sent to me was from a woman named Aurora, and she was speaking to an officer about how her father recently passed away. Don't private message customers saying ""I ain't cough in noone's face."" You did. It happened. It was gross. Don't come to work sick. You would fire any other employee who did this to a customer, you don't get a pass cause you are a manager or owner. Lead by example.> Solid diner fare, with some very interesting specials. I had the huevos rancheros meat lovers version and it was quite good. Very good service, and my table of 3 got some bonus banana bread which was also good. Decent prices as well, giving it a high value experience. It didn't get get crowded until later in the morning. If it was a little bigger and had a bigger menu, I would give them five stars. Try to come off hours, or there might be a line to get in. A diner to keep on your go-to diner list in Boston.BTW, I have been here many times before, and this place has become a standby for weekend breakfasts. It's a bit of a walk from where I usually park, but it's well worth the steps.> Some places just have a god feel. I am always a fan of the authentic diners. My first date with my wife was at my favorite diner in Rochester, NY the Highland Park Diner. We have been touring around Boston and was struggling to find a place in a Sunday afternoon that would satisfy all people in our party. My wife and I are the east ones. It's my 2 teenage daughters that can be challenging to please.  Especially when one is on the white food diet. You know, pasta mashed potatoes chicken fingers pancakes and nothing spicy. Heavy sigh...........Anyway, I decided that a diner would be a good place to try. To my surprise, this was an actual diner. I looked it up on yelp and it fit the bill. The place is small with counter  stools. I love to sit at the counter as we can talk with the staff. The staff did not disappoint. We had a great conversation with our waitress getting to n is about her and her son who was home with a weekend pass. We did order food. I had been in Boston and did. It have any sea food yet. Although it was past lunch I ordered the lobster eggs Benedict. Big chunks of lobster, delicious. The price was right too about $14 if I remember correctly. The coffee was fresh brewed!  We learned that the diner is open 24/7 and is a favorite among local police, fire and when the bars close. This is another example of a nice find on Yelp. I will go out of my way to come back to this place. Oh by the way this diner was in some movies.> Heard about this popular diner in Boston.  Walked about 10 minutes from our hotel. Didn't have to wait for a table but if you do you have to wait outside as there is no room to wait indoors.  This diner has been there for many years.  The food was very good.  The service was as well.  Most of all the company I was with.  Its a great place to come to for breakfast.  Especially if you are looking for that diner flavor.","5, 5, 1, 3, 4"

The traditional antipasto is stunning and a must have. It is customized to the size of your party and my daughter and I left nothing to take home. Our second course was a home made pappardelle bolognese. I cleaned my plate. The combination of meats in the sauce with just the right amount of cheese and perfectly cooked pasta, made this dish a must have. My daughter has food sensitivities our servers accommodated all our requests going out of their way to ensure our needs were met. Service was on point. As soon as my wine glass we getting low, I was asked if I would like another glass of wine.  The melt in your mouth bone in Oso Bucco was our main course and did not disappoint. Be sure to get a reservation because it fills up fast.> I walk in and an older gentleman asks me, are you from Jersey? I served in WWII with a guy with the same last name. Nope, my family settled in Brooklyn. Now show me those meatballs!It's the first time my wife is dining in the North end, waiting outside for these Italian spots isn't something she's ready to experience. My sons girlfriend is Vegan so my mission was to:1- obtain a reservation2- Vegan options (I always get confused, what the heck is the difference between Vegan and Vegetarian? We didn't have these issues in the 70s..)Terramia Ristorante has a nice menu I was able to make a reservation for 4 with no issues.We're seated in a very small dining establishment. The layout squeezes every table for maximum seating. I'm seeing the wait staff hustle around tables and getting the dishes to the patrons. Our waiter comes over and reads the specials to us. I'm in the mood for some freshly shucked Oysters. Fish is what I wish for dining this evening. But first! I wanna try their meatballs. Man oh man, these meatballs are fire! The sauce is fresh and gave the Terramia meatballs an added depth. There's no fillers in their meatballs, it tastes like mamma Terramia is in the back rolling these bad boys.My Oysters? Fresh and a New England treat. If I lived here, I'd have Oysters for breakfast, it's such a guilty pleasure.The same with the dinner special I ordered, Swordfish Puttanesca style. The swordfish wasn't tough, it was cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the little kick, I didn't see any Anchovies? I did enjoy the capers, this is a must order dish if it comes up for a special.No dessert, the kids wanted to take us for cannoli. (And wait on line..)Terramia Ristorante, we enjoyed dining at your establishment.> Went for the pure reason that they have vegan options - the vegan ravioli and the vegan ice cream - both were delicious. In addition, the group had the mozzarella and the 'regular' ravioli as well the scallop appetiser and another pasta dish, which escapes me now. All were very good - very rich.Is it worth the money - ehhh, not sure but I would go back for the vegan dishes alone.> This was just an outstanding meal during dine out week. Both food and service were exceptional. The inside of the restaurant is small but lovely. Definitely make a reservation. The place was near empty when I got there and full when I left. To start, rustic bread with a cannellini bean spread and olive oil was brought to my table. This in itself was 5 stars. As part of dine out week, I ordered the caprese salad, pappardelle bolognese and chicken Marsala. Everything was delicious. I'll be dreaming of the pappardelle until I return. And the chicken Marsala was exquisite with the chicken cooked on the bone and served over fresh spinach and crisp potatoes. I cannot wait to go back. And I think I'll stay for dessert next time. Can't forget to mention the excellent service by Gabrielle and staff!!!> I have been meaning to write this review for my Valentine's Day date at Terramia Ristorante. It is expected that Valentine's Day is a hectic night for the restaurant industry. We arrived about five minutes before our reservation and had to wait over 40 minutes for our table. It was freezing outside and we were huddled up next to another couple in the doorway. One thing that was upsetting was the fact that a few pairs of people were seated at a table for four with two empty seats each. I wish management appropriately planned the seating arrangements to accommodate for the number of reservations. My boyfriend and I did appreciate the two free glasses of red wine after a colleague complained about the long wait. Although the long wait was an annoyance, it was a well-prepared delectable meal with great presentation and an interesting flavor I've never experienced before. The lobster ravioli was one of the most luscious dishes I have ever experienced. I would certainly eat it again.","5, 5, 4, 4, 5"

It felt like being a kid again, so much joy and surprise, and on top of that, I had gone with a group I didn't know well and it was such a good way to get to know people since the teams change often and you play with different people. We left the night like we had been old friends. When I saw they were opening one in Boston, I was excited because I visit often for work. I booked a lane late on a Monday after a work event in Boston and arrived with a bigger group than anticipated. Luckily, the lane holds a good number and you can sub people in and out if people want to stop for a while and chat at the bar instead, so our group was easily accomodated. Our waiter Sam took care of our every need and everyone loved the game and the drinks right away, just like I had my first time in London. I've been recommending Flight Club to everyone I know. Please please pleaseee open a location in Seattle!!> First off, theres not a great selection of upscale bar game hall areas in Boston so I had great expections for Flight Club once I heard it had opened. Initial impressions is that the decor is great and well done and honestly has a cohesive la. However that is where the greatness abruptly ends. The food and drinks were left to be desired.. the titos lime and soda water we got was underwhelming and not strong in the slightest for the money you pay for being in the seaport district. The bartender must have the lightest hand on the planet and the service time for getting the drinks themselves took a while. The food we got was also very subpar. The truffle fries had decent flavor however were lukewarm and cold on some of the fries. Definitely not ideal. The guac was good but the chips tasted slightly burnt. As for the darts which is one of the main reasons I want to come here. YOU HAVE TO RESERVE AHEAD. Otherwise, expect to wait until 11pm or even midnight to be able to  grab a spot. Also I have noticed that while several dart spots were open for well over 20 minutes, that we couldn't expeditite our reservation. I feel that if no members of a reservations party shows up after 30 minutes, then it should go to the next party in the reservation line. At the end of the day I love the concept and will probablly revisit in a few weeks or months to see if things are different. Especially food and beverage wise. UPDATE:I reserved for 12am-1am darts and I showed up at around 11:40 and the bouncer refused us entry as he stated we are ""at capacity"" We wanted to just go in and order drinks at the bar while we wait but he still wouldn't let us in. There were groups behind us who did not have reservations and the bouncer let them in. We had to go out if our way to ask ""why can't we go in to order drinks when other groups without reservation were being let inside after us?"" After that the bouncer apparently says oh you can go in now. ???> Loved the dart games and atmosphere. Service was excellent. Took off a star because we expected more from the food. DO NOT get the Kung Pao cauliflower. All doughy fried breading. Everything we ordered was super salty, including the flatbread, vegetable dumplings, tuna tacos, and al pastor skewers. Hoping the menu is adjusted accordingly.> Admittedly, I had a weird feeling walking in and through this place, which is on the second floor in the same building as Tuscan Kitchen Seaport. It's very circus/fairgrounds, literally. The decor is reminiscent of a circus and the menus are printed in such a way that calls to mind the same. When my friend and I arrived around 7 pm the Sunday before Christmas this week, the ratio of servers to customers seemed off, but it became apparent that servers would be near each game area. We found out after we ordered our drinks at the bar. I had the Butterfly (Citrus vodka, orange blossom, honey, Cocchi Americano, lime, San Pellegrino blood orange soda) and he ordered the Galago (Whiskey, rum, amaro, coffee liqueur, Madagascar vanilla, chicory, cascara). I thought my drink was pretty weak, and this is coming from someone who does not drink. My friend didn't seem that impressed with his drink later. The bartender told us the drinks were pre-mixed. As for the games themselves, I think there were five to choose from. While you can reserve online ahead of time for parties up to 10, we opted to check the place out after dinner nearby and did not have any trouble initially reserving for 30 minutes; we ended up staying an hour so you do have to be mindful of time especially if it's not crowded and you're having fun. We were in playing area three (oche) which offered a nice view of the area outside. I don't think areas five and six were occupied until after we started. Flight Club has a dozen oches where pricing seems to fluctuate during peak times. I don't think it's by individual so it's more cost-efficient to go with a bunch of people. I think the limit might be six people per oche. They have a user-friendly technology to keep track of scoring which helps as where the dart lands in each game has a different value. We played four games and probably could have played one more but decided it was time to cash out.A server stood between our areas to answer any questions and take food/drink orders. He was really nice and attentive but my friend did not think the automatic 20% gratuity was warranted. As we headed out, more people arrived. The space is quite large and seemed so in proportion to the number of employees and guests but I could see it filling up in the evenings and weekends or during social events. I had a lot of fun but if anything, it confirmed I really need to work on upping my game.> We had so much fun going there. This place is always packed now and you have to book in advance. The drinks are very good and the way they are displayed was very different I thought it was great. The food selection is interesting we got a bunch of different things. We got the pizza, the Tacos, the pork on a stick which I didn't love. We stayed there for 2 hours so we had to order the same thing more than once because the food menu is just a little limited in my opinion but otherwise everything was great including the service Definitely a fun place to go","5, 3, 3, 4, 4"

Warm and cozy, with down-to-earth and unpretentious vibes. And yes -- the waffles are delicious too. FOOD: Waffles can be pretty pricey. Our Liege Waffle + Strawberry Glamour toppings and a scoop of ice cream came to $9.63. But it was so, so worth it. The waffle was fluffy and incredibly fresh; the strawberries were sweet and best of all, there were a lot of them. And then the Belgian chocolate drizzle on top was heavenly. The use actual melted down chocolate here, like fondue, and none of the Hershey's chocolate syrup type. This is the real deal. If you're looking to come here to get work done, take note: their policy is no Wi-Fi on weekends (their own network), but you can easily hop onto Berryline's open Wi-Fi network instead. Berryline is directly downstairs so the signal strength is good. Zinneken's is my new favorite cozy dessert place in the square. 5/5 for quality and ambiance.> if you want the best waffles in cambridge, look no further. this little nook has AMAZING waffles - fluffy, crispy, and sweet all in one. there is definitely really limited space inside so be prepared to wait for a spot. however, it's 100% worth it for these waffles. so many different options to choose from and the vibes in here were amazing and warm. it was kinda like being in a little cabin and even if the space was small i think it just added another dimension to the experience!! will definitely be returning here if i'm in boston again.> It was late already after a dinner but we knew we were missing something.... dessert! We couldn't help but stop by this cute little store that we had seen earlier while coming into Harvard Square. When you open the door to Zinneken's, you're overwhelmed by the amazing smell of Belgian pastries and coffee... so amazing! We ordered  #3, the Sins (Banana & Nutella) + Strawberries and a Vanilla Latte to share. The waffle had the nice chewy texture that you want when having a Belgian waffle! Add the fresh fruit and Nutella and you'll have a great dessert to share :)> This is my routine rainy, cold day: go to Santouka for ramen, walk down the street after, go to Zinneken's for a waffle. It's honestly the ideal rainy day. The liege waffle is my favorite. It's warm and soft and chewy - so delicious. The bananas with caramel and whipped cream is my favorite topping combo. I'm not a huge fan of the crunchy waffle but to each their own. The restaurant itself is pretty small so it can be tough to get a table when it's busy. Especially when students are back at Harvard. And i think the waffles are kinda pricey. The menu says $4.70 for the waffle but the toppings will set you back ~$8. However, delicious waffles, cute cafe, good tea!> I L-O-V-E waffles in comparison to pancakes. Especially when warm toppings are involved. A friend of mine suggested here after we had ramen at Santouka because I was feeling for something sweet. It was my first time. We got a crunchy waffle and a soft waffle, personally I love crunchy waffles but the soft one was pretty good too- this place makes the best soft waffle I've had thus far coming from a crunchy person.We got strawberry and nutella on the crunchy and banana, caramel and whipped cream on the the soft waffle. I really enjoyed both I could decide which one I wanted to be the last taste in my mouth.I didn't realise EACH topping was an additional $1. I thought you picked either waffle for $4.70 then any combo topping. I think they should state the additional topping cost at the top of the menu instead of at the bottom since I didn't notice that off the bat. Their topping combo list is very helpful though with pairing each one to another.I'll be back again! Just what I needed on a cold rainy night.","5, 5, 5, 5, 4"
Saigon Chicken House,Boston,4,2,No,Null,No,Null,Vietnamese,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,10:00 am - 10:00 pm,Null,Null,"My friend had been to Saigon Chicken House, but it was my first visit.Saigon Chicken House is across the street from the post office and a short walk from the Red Line Fields Crossing station on the Ashmont line.  It is rather spacious inside with 4 round tables surrounded by rectangular tables and smaller round tables set by the walls.Her impression was that the chicken was good here, but the rice plates were not quite sufficient for an individual's appetite.  so we ended up sharing a half chicken portion of their Special Qui Phi Chicken Steam (Market Price - $20 on this visit), chicken rice $3 (vs $2 for plain rice), and #101 Noodle Soup with crab, shrimp paste, snails, and water spinach $10.95.The chicken was good, but I particularly enjoyed the chicken rice with a good douse of the ginger fish sauce which had accompanied the chicken.  The noodles in the soup were a thick round noodle.  The bowl generous and flavorful with a manageable hit of heat.  The snails found at the bottom of the bowl were a bit rubbery so I could have done without.The special Bo Ne - Vietnamese Sizzling Steak $13.95 sounded tempting, but my DC has her eye on trying one of the hot pots with a larger party in the future.> Came here specifically for their ""Bo Ne"" aka ""Vietnamese Sizzling Steak"" because it's hard to find as not a lot of Vietnamese restaurants offer this item. It comes with two pieces of ""steak"" which is really just basic slices of beef, an over-easy egg, pate, onions, cilantro and green bell peppers. It's definitely a cool dish as it's brought out on a sizzling platter with french bread. You basically assemble the sandwich yourself - spread the pate on one side of the bread and the runny yolk from the egg on the other side. Unfortunately the sandwich was hard to eat because the ""steak"" is tough and hard to bite into - I guess they didn't do a thorough job of tenderizing the meat. I would definitely recommend cutting up bite-sized pieces with your knife first...which is kind of lame. The sauce/marinade was WAY too sweet for me. It was like a flavor explosion but not in a good way. It's a cool dish to try but I wouldn't order it again. It also comes with a side of fries? So strange.We really liked the ""Oc Len Xao Dua"" or snails with coconut cream. You're supposed to be able to suck out the snail from the shell but we were struggling to do that...asked for a few toothpicks to try to pick them out. The coconut cream sauce was delicious. The ""Nem Cuon"" was just okay to me...the nem or grilled pork was much too thin. For such a thick spring roll with so many veggies and a fried egg roll wrapper it needed a much thicker piece of meat. I did like the crunch I got with each bite though from the fried egg roll wrapper inside the spring roll. The dipping sauce was just alright as well. My date ordered the com tam 4 mau and seemed to like it because he ate the entire thing.> The bot chien and bo ne here is absolutely amazing. Our go to dishes that we always get when we come here. The oc xao dua is also pretty good. They give you a pretty good amount of oc and it tastes so good with the creamy coconut sauce. One of our go to spots for Vietnamese breakfast!> I've had my eyes set on this restaurant for quite some time now as it's a Vietnamese restaurant where the main attraction isn't pho like many others around the city. Scrolling through the pictures, it was apparent that their chicken rice dishes and the beef Napoleon are the stars of the restaurant. As this as my first time visiting, those were the two dishes that I tried. Chicken:For this dish, I opted for the dark meat which was $1 more than the white meat option. The chicken comes deboned on top of a mound of rice with what seemed to be some steamed Chinese yu choy, sliced cucumber, and a thick cut tomato. The chicken was topped with a dollop of scallion/ginger, similar to HK bbq places. There's also a cup of soup that came in the side as well. believe it also came with a side of sweet dipping sauce, but not too sure on this as we also got the Napoleon.As far as taste goes, the chicken was actually quite bland. The dish as a whole is reminiscent of the Hainanese chicken rice dishes that you can find in Singaporean restaurants as it has the chicken on top of flavorful rice with a side of soup and dipping sauces. 3/5 for this dish.Beef Napoleon:I actually had a hard time finding this initially as it was the last item on the appetizer menu. This dish consists of cooked tenderized steak (probably from baking soda) in a tomato-esque sauce, a medium cooked egg, some pate, topped with some raw onions, cilantro, green peppers, and a healthy dose of butter on a hot sizzling platter. The dish also comes with a loaf of bread that you'd see used for banh mi sandwiches and French fries. We took chunks of the bread and made mini sandwiches out of all the items on the platter. The sauce on the beef is more on the sweeter side but the star of the show has to be the pate! 5/5 for this dish.All in all, I was pretty satisfied with the meal but the beef Napoleon takes much of the credit. I am actually quite disappointed by the chicken as it is called Chicken House. The restaurant also had an unpleasant smell similar to some Asian grocery stores. Not sure if it's always like that,  it definitely not the best when trying to eat.> Their staple is their farm raised chicken buuuut it was rather anticlimactic. My boyfriend got pho and the broth was oily. I got the chicken & dried bamboo noodle soup with glass noodles and that broth was just super bland no matter how much seasoning I added. The service was slow as well but maybe because they were understaffed and it was busy since it's Sunday. The only good thing we had that I would strongly suggest is their Bò Né, and that's it.","4, 4, 5, 4, 3"

I ate here because I thought I could use my priority pass membership for a discount on my meal. However, as of last August, apparently they discontinued this benefit. So - if you have priority pass, just know that you cannot use it here anymore. This was disappointing as there is no other priority pass lounge in the B terminal and there is no way to access other lounges in the other terminals without exiting security. I got a coffee (I am an espresso snob but they do not have espresso drinks here) which was actually decent for drip coffee. Also got the caprese panzanella salad. The salad was ok. It was arugula, large chunks of yellow and red tomatoes, large croutons, large chunks of mozzarella and some basil pesto on top. It took a while to come out and when I got it, I didn't understand why it took so long to throw that together. Everything was in very large pieces and just layered on top of the dry arugula. The tomatoes didn't taste very fresh either, felt like they had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while. It sounded like a good idea, but not too well executed. The service was friendly and timely. However the food was overpriced. My salad was $17 and coffee $3. I probably wouldn't eat here again.> Pretty good for airport food.My order: Caesar salad (15) add pan seared steak. (10) cooked medium rare. This salad hit the spot. Very fresh lettuce with no rotten leaves. Steak was perfectly cooked.Con: steak was drastically under seasoned. Though this isn't a problem, as there's freshly ground pepper which was an easy fix.Friendly service (I believe Colin was my waiter?). They immediately ask you how long until your flight, which is lovely.Overall I'd eat here again. Kind of expensive, but definitely tasty.I would have had a cocktail if it wasn't $15> Very friendly staff willing to go the extra mile for an airport breakfast.  Though the menu only has the fruit listed as gluten-free, I asked for additional options.  The grill cook cleaned his entire grill ( they often toast their bread on the same surface so be careful) so that I could have a veggie omelet.  It was so delicious.  The spinach as perfectly wilted with tomatoes that were just cooked enough that they were soft but not mushy and tons of feta cheese.  Additionally, the gluten-free toast was an unexpected surprise!  This is my new terminal B breakfast of choice!","3, 4, 3, 4, 5"

Everything we ordered was delicious but the star of the night was definitely the salt and pepper squid! It was phenomenal. If you're big fan of clay pot rice, this is the place to go. They make them in family size for sharing.  This place serves some of the best authentic Chinese food I have ever had in the USA. It is a small place and no frills but don't be fooled, the food was fantastic. Even as I write this review, my mouth waters at the thought of ALL that delicious food. I will sure come back when is Boston.> It is a great restaurant if you care about the food taste and affordability. It is a bad restaurant if you care about the atmosphere and decorations. The service is good and prompt.We had three dishes for two: Gui Fei Chicken, fried sticky rice and garlic giant mussels. All are amazing! The total price is around $30 before tax and tips. We ended up with enough leftover for next day. Certainly will come back and try more dishes!> This pace was recommended by a friend whom I implicitly trust for Cantonese cuisine, since he grew up in Hong Kong. Came with a couple of other friends and thought the food overall was quite good. Pro-tip: always bring someone who can order off of the Chinese only menu.Pro-tip: I think food is always better with good company.> After eating lunch, I'm sitting here puzzled why this place has so many raving reviews. I ordered their brisket w/ bean curd rice plate and I got more bean curd and fat than actual peices of meat! I counted 3 LITTLE pieces of flesh in there and that was it. Now I see why the plates are reasonably priced, because it's mostly rice and barely any meat. No thanks, I'll stick to my regular spot up the street from this place. I'm giving it 2 stars simply because they are friendly and give good customer service.","4, 4, 5, 5, 4"

I do hate that they consistently change their menu to take away my favorite pizza but their pizza is great. A lot of places or people wouldn't believe in such a thing but my wife has a tomato intolerance. She developed it about 7 years ago and it has made my pizza eating life hell. I love pizza. It was something I ate a lot of. And then the intolerance came where she couldn't digest tomato anymore. Pizza became a rarity to me. Then we found Ottos. I was always against the idea of a white pizza. It just didn't make sense to me. But their white pizzas are enjoyable not only for her but for me too. I ask that if Ottos reads this you bring back two. The arugula, pear and blue cheese. And the pineapple and red pepper flake pizza. They were quite divine. If you're adventurous in your food and willing to go against the grain of your typical cheese pizza or your pepperoni pizza give this place a shot. The mashed potato pizza is a great choice. Also the house side salad is great. I love the house dressing. I was mad when that went away but happy to have it back.> OTTO has been on my list for a while and I'm happy that I was finally able to give it a try. From best to just alright are:1. Mashed Potato, Bacon, and Scallion: a really unique combination and taste exactly like a baked potato but way better. Points for originally and overall tastiness.2. Spicy Pulled Pork, Sausage, Pepperoni: what I considered a ""classic"" pizza. What I expected from essentially a meat lovers pizza and it delivered.3. Pineapple, Bacon, Hot Honey: this was my least favorite. Compared to the other two pizzas, it didn't hit the spot for a pizza. You get a wide range of flavors from spicy, sour, savory but still just meh.Definitely want to give their other pies a try next time I'm here.> Need to improve pizza delivery, arrived very cold.  Avoid cookies.  Meatballs good.> I've passed this place so many times on the B line and never once went there until this weekend. It was real cold and snowy outside so when my boyfriend and I went, there was only 1 other couple in there besides us. The lighting is very cool, industrial-looking lighting with just the individual bulbs. There's tons of space. I imagine this place fills up on a Friday or Saturday evening when it's nice out and school's in session. They had one large TV playing the AFC Championship game and they also serve alcohol so it's a pretty good option for game nights, I'd say.We sat down, looked at the menu and once we were ready, went up to order. I had the buffalo cauliflower with no scallions and bleu cheese and boyfriend had a spicy pulled pork one. Both were large-ish pizzas and we were both full after eating them. Great flavor, great amount, crust was pretty good as well. They also have a water dispenser in case you didn't want to buy any drinks but still want to stay hydrated. They have pizza by the slices @ 3.50 but 13 for a whole pizza is not bad, especially for dinner. Pretty typical dinner prices.Really love their buffalo cauliflower pizza so would definitely come back and get some! Right off the B line too, easy pick up.> Nice staff. Quick service. Pizza was ok. Lots of different and tasty options. Unique choices that would surprise you at how good they taste. Depending on the pizza, there are some things I was not a fan of. Others may find it really good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce on the cheese pizza. I found it to be a little too sour. The outside of the crust was dry and lacked taste. If you don't eat the crust, you'll love it. If your favorite part is the crust, go into it without expectations.","5, 4, 3, 4, 4"

When we arrived, our server greeted us warmly and gave us our choice of seating.  You wouldn't know it when you firs walk-in, but they do have ""outside seating"" towards the back of the restaurant.  During the colder months, it's an enclosed outside patio, with heating, which is a great way to shake off the feeling of being cooped up inside.As others have mentioned, it's pricey.  We ordered about 5 small plates from the menu, and had 2 bottles of wine, for a little over $220.  But, the food is great!  We loved everything we ordered (avocado toast, tuna crudo, anchovies, mussels)- with one exception: the cauliflower dish.  The avocado toast is awesome, and while I think it normally comes in 3 slices, since there were 4 of us, our server added an extra slice so the entire table could enjoy - a nice touch!  Our server also very graciously brought us out multiple orders of bread, that broth from the mussels was too good to go to waist! There are 3 things you won't find on the menu:1) tea2) warm drinks3) dessert  Happy Dining!> Select oyster bar does seafood perfectly in Boston. This restaurant is tiny and romantic and a perfect spot for a special evening out on the town. We decided to split the lobster salad and beet salad to start. The lobster salad has large chunks of lobster knuckles, cabbage and radish and is dressed in a light vinaigrette. This salad is a large portion and well worth the cost. The beet salad is the best I've had in Boston. The beets are atop a goat cheese-yogurt spread and covered in candied Pepitas. For main dishes we ordered the swordfish, halibut and sea bass special of the day. All main dishes were delicious but it was agreed that the swordfish was the winner. I have never had swordfish so light and moist. It is seared and placed atop a bed of roasted cauliflower, crispy chickpeas and mango. The special was a seared sea bass on top of a bed of farro with lobster and cherry garnish. The halibut was the least favourite of the dishes, however, it was hard to compare when the swordfish was so unreal. The only downside to this restaurant is that they do not offer a dessert.Overall select is one of my new favourite spots in Boston and a place where I will frequently return.> Select was really good. I had the Arctic char ($33) and it was one of the best fish entrees I've had in a while, cooked to a perfect medium rare with a beautiful crisp skin. The octopus and salmon crudo were also good, although less memorable. The oysters were great as expected, and offered a nice local selection if not a particularly expansive one. Our waiter was really nice and attentive as well.A couple of things to know--it's very expensive. Like others have mentioned, when factoring in the included 20% gratuity you should probably expect to spend around $100-120 on dinner for two. Another thing, there are no dessert options, which is fine since there are plenty of walkable options around, but keeps the experience from deserving the full five stars.> My husband and my go-to for date nights. We've tried most items on the menu, all of which are amazing. You can't go wrong. We always ditch the main entrees (which are good, don't get me wrong) and get a million appetizers. Our favorite is the salmon crudo that comes with pistachio oil. Ask for bread to dip in that oil. Talk about foodgasm. Another favorite is the octopus. If you think that sounds gross, you can go be a loser and miss out on life.Service is always amazing. Get a reservation.> Terrible service experience, and from what I've read of other reviews, Select does NOT respect its customers and appeared Dishonest in its communication. We had a 7:45 dinner reservation for a special occasion. Recognizing that we were running a little late due to traffic and parking condition, I called Select as a courtesy. The man who answered the phone immediately responded ""just so you know that would cut into your dinner."" And proceed to put us on hold. Excuse me? I didn't realize that we had a time limit to our dinner. Looking up on OpenTable yielded plenty of availability in the next hour. I'm not sure if we only had 30 mins time limit to a potentially $200+ dinner but seemed to be so according to this logic?We gave up waiting after 5 minutes on hold. Afterwards, I've tried calling them back a couple of times and got an answer machine.As a frequent restaurant goer, I've always wanted to give a place a try and disregard the occasional bad reviews. But I will not tolerate disrespect. If you are still considering this place, just read about the reviews of similar treatments that had happened to other guests in the past, and SAVE your special night.","4, 5, 5, 4, 5"

We were greeted and seated immediately as we were they before the dinner rush and were given a run down of the menu. I started off ordering the  New England clam chowder (local clams, potatoes, celery, carrots, bacon, and cream) and Flemish Red Ale.The chowder was really good with large chunks of clams, potatoes and a very cream sauce that really hit the spot on a cold day. The Flemish red ale was also really good so much so that I ordered a second one. Red Ale's are not always readily available in my home town so this was a nice surprise. For my main course, I decided to go with the Seafood Stew (fennel, onion, tomato, local clams, shrimp, fresh PEI mussels, Spanish chorizo) served with a Baguette. The addition of Spanish chorizo to a seafood dish really peaked my interest so I decided to give it a try. When it came out, it looked and smelled delicious. All the ingredients were fresh and the zesty, lemony broth brought it all together. It was a no brainer to use the baguettes to soak up all the broth and not waste any of it and I didn't. All that was left were empty clam/mussel shells. Overall, this is a great neighborhood type restaurant/pub to come relax and have good drinks/food with friends and I look forward to coming back.> Best kettle fries and dip I have ever had!Hubby loved his clam chowder and salmon BLT.Excellent lamb burger.Great service.> Fish and Chips, solid! Clam Chowder good. Flatbread pizza little bland. Steak Egg Rolls very good. Root Beer on tap is like mainlining sugar, very flavorful, could have used some ice. Over all a winner. Was staying at hotel next door. Enjoyed.> My damn my damn! Excellent service and even better food!Had an amazing waitress (don't know her name bust she's from Lithuania) gave me some great recommendations and kept a smile on. The music made me feel is if I was at an old school concert of 70's and 80's R&B. Jam, after jam, after JAM!!Ambiance is very chill but yet live. Definitely, a place for families and friends.  I had the Colombian skillet and the mimosa little bar. Phenomenal! The seasoning on the home fries were really tasty. Scrambled eggs were done just right and the pull pork was beyond flavorful. If I could give this 10 stars I would but I'll give the requirement, five lol. Great place for brunch> Expected this place to be your average tourist trap given its proximity to the Freedom Trail on the way to Bunker Hill. However, I was pleasantly surprised by their brunch offerings. I had the Charlestown omelette which is a simple ham and cheese omelette (sans the included onions/peppers). The omelette comes along with toast and home fries. The serving was more than enough for the price and everything seemed freshly prepared. Service was friendly and good. Would come again if in the area.","4, 5, 4, 5, 4"

Seems like it would be a cool spot on a game day.> We came upon this place as it is located right by Fenway Park and it was a good find. They have a good selection of beer, lots of American classic eats and the prices were fair especially for their location. I had a chicken, bacon and blue cheese sandwhich which was on special and it was delicious and huge!! The fries were my favorite part. They were crispy and airy. Everyone liked their food. They even offered gluten free buns which is a plus for my boyfriend with allergies. Downside was they were very understaffed with one girl doing over 7 tables so it was hard to order drinks or ask for things but she did her absolute best and was sweet. Also the soda had a bad taste to which she gladly replaced with water and apologized. We would return in the future when we finally get to see the red socks in season.> Went recently and it was dead. Two others at the bar. Got take out. Was missing one item, one item was wrong and one was just awful. Roasted pear salad had raw shaved pears on it. When you order tots for your kids you get sweet potato fries. I just ordered from somewhere else. Staff was nice though but how was everything that wrong and bad if nobody was there?Okay. It won't let me reply to the response given to me. Instead of an apology how about a reimbursement for getting it all wrong Joe?> Really annoyed with this place. I came here looking for some good beer and a soft pretzels with cheese. They didn't have either!!!! The yelps pictures of the pretzels were old and they no longer carry them on the menu so BEWARE! Call and check before you think you're getting something good lol. The beers were alright- average- nothing special. Many of the beers I wanted they were out of.

Hojoko is one of Boston's more trendy restaurants that will guarantee a good time for both smaller and larger groups (and those with dietary restrictions).They offer ""bowls"" for those of us 21+ in sizes for 2-3, 4, and 5+ people. My friends and I ordered the Fumador, and while it might not have been quite *worth* the amount of alcohol for the total price, it was still a really fun experience. The food matched the drinks, great tasting but potentially a little on the expensive side. I had the tuna burger which had wonderful flavors and INCREDIBLE McDonalds-like fries, and my friends enjoyed their noodles and sushi as well. A member of our party is allergic to both eggs and gluten, and our waitress who was incredibly well versed in the menu, readily accommodated his restrictions. Further, when bringing out each dish, they would announce whether it was one of the gluten/egg free ones.> I met up with a coworker last night for drinks and snacks at Hojoko (previously the Howard Johnson's from way back) to see what it was like. We got there around 5:30 and sat at the bar, as we were the first ones there.The bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly and poured a very good cocktail (shout out to Jen!).Well the food was very delicious I was a bit disappointed by the cost/amount ratio. We started off with an order of fries and the chicken win from the Robata Grill. The fries are shoestring style and very hot & tasty. The wings while hot and delicious were lacking in numbers; only 3 wings for $9 - yikes. Then, we ordered chicken tails (there's such a thing) skewer for $6, Kurobuta pork belly skewer for $6 and the sashimi salmon for $9. Both of the skewers were tasty and easy to eat, but didn't have a lot. Then, the sashimi salmon was excellent, but only came with 4 thin slices.So, we had a nice time, but I left still hungry and wondering how it all came to just under $85. I guess that's what you get when you mix trendy and the new Fenway neighborhood.> Came here with some friends last night around 11. The man working the door was very strange and pushy even though there was no line. They were what I would call a normal amount of busy for a Saturday night but appeared to be extra busy as two bartenders were running around like lunatics trying to serve everyone,while the other two moved at a snails pace sipping on their own beers more than serving others. One bartender took our order first, then continuously got distracted taking other orders and serving people that came to the bar far after us , that he actually  had to come back and ask what we ordered again. No apology. And then still closed someone's tab before making or drinks. Fast forward a full 25 minutes, and we finally have  our small, decently tasting $13 a piece cocktails. Recap: overpriced and very poor service, but cool vibe.> Love the vibe here. Dark, colorful, retro. Saw music and ate delicious prawns the first time I came. The second time I tried the funky chicken ramen with a friend- which was wonderful. The noodles are great- the flavor has a nice salty punch, and the chicken and gooey egg on top are amazing. This past time I came for a late night bite with friends. They got fruity drinks- mai tai, and a passion fruit drink. We had the funky chicken ramen, wings (half soy garlic half gochujang), and the kimchi fried rice.  The gochujang wings and ramen were the stand-outs. My friend liked the crispiness of the rice (which had thick cut pieces of bacon and shrimp).Update! Came back- still lots of fun. Started with Jasper's rum punch for 2. Very fruity and icy (lots of ice- gets hard to drink towards the end). I appreciated it more towards the end of the meal, when the nutmeg topper along with the fruitiness added a nice touch.Nori taco is the show stopper- fatty delicious fish, crunchy nori. Shrimp toast was also delicious. It's like shumai with a crunchy exterior. Never had that before. Awesome vibe here. Come, it's so fun!> This place has great vibes for a date or group outing. The decor is rock/retro/eclectic with Japanese touches - all kind of odd when put together but also entertaining. Highly recommend making a reservation, so you don't have to stand outside and wait in the cold!My boyfriend and I both had sake. I had the Kunizakari Nigori (unfiltered sake), and I loved it. It reminds of the Chinese fermented rice dish (tian jiu niang). In terms of food, we loved the salmon sashimi, crispy nori taco, and spicy miso ramen. The Hojoko cheeseburger was good but underwhelming (also not worth $18). Service was decent. Prices were a bit steep, but a date night in Boston is pretty much going to cost $80-$100 with food and drinks. Happy to have found another place for Asian/fusion cuisine.","4, 3, 2, 5, 5"

They were both super aesthetically pleasing, and I just love cheesecake and couldn't resist. The cake, itself, was very delicious! It was the perfect amount of sweetness without being too overwhelming. The blueberry topping went the best with the cheesecake, in my opinion! The service was very quick and efficient after I ordered!Overall, I had a great experience and I loved the blueberry cheesecake a lot! I'll be back for more!> This cafe is popping up everywhere around Boston. I lived in the city for 7 years and when I left there may be been only 2 locations. Now, it's in almost every major hood.

They give stellar service and have an extensive gluten free menu. I got the BLAT sandwich and it was incredibly yummy. They have a stellar latte as well. Really the best part of this please is the ambiance- full of white bricks, and wood finishes it's a really beautiful natural light spot.

I went here for many years as a college student in Boston and it never disappointed especially on the college budget. For NEU students this place also accepts dining dollars which is clutch.Overall recommend this place on any occasion. It's a Huntington classic.> Used to come here a lot before I discovered other thai food places that are better (Pho Basil, Pad Thai Cafe, Rod Dee 2/Rod Thai). The food here was alright, not amazing nor horrible. The service can be a hit or miss. This area is also mainly frequented with college students, so it can get rowdy and chaotic. I would usually order crispy chicken fried rice which is pretty good, though the portion size isn't the biggest.If you need thai food and can't walk any further, Pho & I will do. If you want amazing thai food, walk 5 more minutes and go to Pho Basil which is closeby.> Ordered Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea ... liked the place the hostess is not super friendly but overall her service was good and acceptable.I like that you can eat at the bar area allows for quick turnover :)Unfortunately the pad thai had a melted chemical flavor. Maybe the plastic utensils they are using in the cooking process. Tastes like pad thai plastic special> This is a very decent Vietnamese establishment. They shine with their tom kha soup and the seasoning on the beef.I had a vermicelli and beef noodle bowl and Tom kha soup. The soup was on par with all other places for this soup. The vermicelli bowl was good, but the portion of beef was not really enough. It was deliciously seasoned though. The overall bowl was a smaller portion than you'd expect, but it was enough for me for dinner. If you've got a big appetite, expect to finish it.The service was fine, and when they got my order wrong it came out correctly within 5 minutes. - I had ordered soup in the beginning so I wasn't starving.My friend has the pho (with beef) and she said that the beef was abnormally good, but the broth tasted more veggie based to her. She was not a fan. I'm giving this three stars because I'd come back here willingly. I'd likely check out other options first though.> The seafood dish was extremely spicy, but had 5 mussels and nice shrimps and scallops.  Drunken noodle was great.","4, 3, 2, 3, 4"

If you do, then you're lying to yourself. Other than their poké, I've tried everything else on their menu (pulled pork, mochiko chicken, BBQ chicken) and they never disappoint. They even make sandwiches too?!? Thanks for bringing island flavor to Massachusetts.Much Aloha,Ben T.> Truly the king of poke in the Boston area! The energy is lively, and the people are so friendly and approachable. It's a pretty casual space - you order at the register and pick up your plate at the counter. Also, the art on the wall really added to the ~seaside~ vibe and made for a really pleasant dining experience. I got the salmon poke bowl, which was really delicious! In addition to the super fresh and well-seasoned fish, I also loved the cucumber kimchi and crispy chickpeas. We ordered the banana pudding (I love tapioca so this was a huge hit) and wanted to try the pineapple cake, but they were sold out around dinner time. Definitely looking forward to coming again!> Had my first visit here yesterday and I was completely wowed and regretted that why I hadn't found this hidden gem earlier. Food was insanely good and the service was also amazing! I ordered the two protein plate and chose the shoyu salmon and fried chicken. Salmon was very fresh (I think they cubed it and seasoned it after I placed my order?). The fried chicken was very amazing: crunchy on the outside and juicy and tender in the inside. They also coat it with a honey glaze seasoning, which gave another kick to its already amazing flavor. Side dishes include a salad, some pickled cucumber and fried chickpeas. Those were good too.For dessert, I got both the banana pudding and the pineapple cake. YOU HAVE TO GET BOTH BECAUSE BOTH ARE INSANELY DELICIOUS. The pineapple cake, which is what the restaurant is famous for, completely change my biased opinion towards pineapple cake. Before I tasted this one, in my mind pineapple cake was dry, overly sweet and boring. However, this one was super delicious. They glazed the outside with some form of sugar, and after baking or caramelization, the outside became super crunchy. The cake itself was also not overly sweet and the pineapple flavor from the top of the cake was strong. For the banana pudding, it had tapioca in the inside, which added a very interesting texture to the pudding. On top, they put some crunchy cereal and coconut cream, both of which balanced very well to the overall texture and flavor. Again this one was also not overly sweet too, love it! The server here also recommended another way of eating it: put the pineapple cake inside the bowl of banana pudding, and have them together. I tried it, it was good, so get both desserts lol What also impressed me here was the service. Apparently there were a lot of old customers from before the restaurant was closed. When they came in they all greeted with the workers here and expressed how excited they were when they found this place reopened again. Customers treated the workers as friends, and vice versa. When I left, the workers here also said my name and said goodbye to me :)So warm and welcoming! I will definitely come back and check the other dishes that I was not able to try out this time!> We grabbed some take-out from here a few weeks ago, we planned on eating there but all the tables were full. I love the atmosphere and the staff was super friendly, surfboard used as a table for chopsticks, forks, napkins, etc., is such a cool idea. I got the Kalua pig sandwich with mac salad, sandwich was huge and delicious and I am in LOVE with the mac salad, but the portion was very skimpy. My son got some kind of tuna poke bowl which of course I had to try and it was excellent, even the white rice is really, really good. I wish the place was a bit bigger and open more often, but it was a real treat. can't wait to go back.> Update: They are only open during the weekends!Came back to Manoa after a year or two, with a big craving for the deliciousness served here. I ordered a mix plate with salmon belly and spicy tuna- it was perfection. For dessert, my friend and I couldn't decide between their signature pineapple cake or banana pudding, but the guy who takes the orders gave us the banana pudding for free so we could try both! What a gem. He is such a pleasure. Anyway, food was amazing as always, and the dessert blew us away too. I knew the pineapple cake was good from last time, but the banana pudding tasted so fresh/natural (like, the taste of REAL bananas and not just sweet yellow goo) and had tapioca in it so that was definitely my favorite. The prices are fair because it is so so good and the service is always a pleasure, so no complaints. Can't wait to be back- wish it wasn't just weekends!","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

This place has it all, ranging from savory rice bowls to hearty salads as well as breakfast/brunch options that I have yet to try. Their menu is super long and diverse that anyone should be able to find something to their liking.I got the winter vegetable wild rice bowl (warm wild rice mixed with baby spinach, celery root, sweet potato, dried cranberry, toasted pumpkin, sunflower seeds and black sesame served with sherry dressing and labneh (yogurt cheese) - $11.50. Very tasty with a creamy texture and healthy ingredients. My friend got the maple, squash and chicken salad that comes with a roll (mixed greens, roasted butternut squash, acorn squash, carrots, delicious chicken breast topped with toasted almonds and dried cranberries with maple labneh dressing) - $13. The chicken was the right texture btwn chewy and tough. Ask for the dressing on the side tho, since default is to mix the dressing into the salad.We then finished off with a mixed fruit tart ($7), which was heavenly. Topped with blackberries, blueberries, and a strawberry, this pastry was creamy and memorable without being overly sweet. I had the iced americano ($3 for small), which was smooth and perfect with the tart. In summary, Tatte has excellent food and desserts of high quality, all tastes were of good balance without being overwhelming, for reasonable prices (desserts might be on the pricier side), and food is served to you at the table. I'll be back to try their other items!> At 8:30 am this past Sunday, I strolled in surprised to see customers planted at tables and enjoying food and drinks. I loved how the corner location of this Tatte was illuminated by the morning light, which is further amplified by the nearly floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the store. There are various configurations for seats, including along a counter that is the length of one side of the cafe and faces Atlantic Blvd. and small circular tables for individual, pair, or small groups where the seats are either individual chairs or banquette. There is also a long table for more communal seating and bar seating where drinks are made. Pendant lights and sconces provided additional lighting. I listed four pastries and the server waited until I was done before grabbing them even though she was standing right in front of them. The ham and cheese croissant was interesting as it had wholegrain mustard slathered inside. I liked the kouign-amann for its sugar sprinkled layers and buttery and sweet flavor but I didn't think it had a crispy enough caramel coating on the exterior. While the chocolate within the chocolate croissant was good, I wish there was more, either with chocolate drizzled on top or folded more evenly within the pastry itself. Here, the chocolate came in the form of two cigarillo-like forms, spaced on each end of the croissant. Also, when it comes to chocolate croissants, I have yet to find a place that makes the croissant the same as a regular croissant. Of the four, I preferred the almond croissant most. I liked that the croissant tasted croissant-like, that it was dusted with powdered sugar, and that it had both almond slices on top and almond paste within the layers of pastry. I thought the pastries were good, but a few could have benefited from being warmed up, which was not an option offered to me. (I'm not sure it is one.)Service was excellent; everyone spoke clearly, smiled, and was eager to help and answer questions. I haven't been to Tatte in awhile so I was a bit overwhelmed. There were laminated menus on two small tables, as well as a whole display area of pastries. In the display case, two pear pies, an entire cinnamon walnut coffee cake, a honey apple cake, several pistachio, cherry tarts, an entire orange upside down cake, and a pear almond galette were all neatly and prominently arranged. For most of the pies, slices or the entire thing could be purchased. Behind the cashier, there was also another wall menu and a separate area for drinks. It's also worth noting that items were clearly labeled with their names and prices.> This is a solid place.A bit on the pretentious side, but most of what is available is really good.I've always had really good service and knowledgeable help when I had a question.Service is quick.A bit on the pricey side.  That is, the value isn't there, but it is always tasty.If you have a lunch date, you can't go wrong here.> Visiting Boston for a few days with my husband and we were recommended Tatte for breakfast on our first day. It was AMAZING, and I am so sad we don't have Tatte on the west coast. This was the best shashuka I have ever had, and it was big enough for us to share. The house latte was also delicious and the pastries looked amazing. I loved the atmosphere too, it was crowded, but there was a great energy in there. When we come back to Boston, we will 100% be back at Tatte.> A lot of brunch places seemed to be closed on Sunday, but luckily we were passing by and this place was buzzin. There were a lot of people so we saved two seats before ordering. My bf got a muffin which was good and bottled carrot juice which was surprisingly okay because it wasn't too carrot-y. He also got egg in a hole, adding ham. I got the croque madame - the ham and cheese were delicious. I think you can get black coffee and tea at the regular counter, but other drinks have to be picked up at the coffee bar. The decor was simple and clean.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

I can only go when  I'm traveling to Boston for work and this is something that I look forward to. I usually get a burrito but am also interested in trying the Ramen. They are  quick and easy. Seating available there if you would like to eat in. I also love the compostable take away boxes if you are looking to eat out. Highly recommend.> My friends and I stumbled upon this place while we were in the area looking for sushi. I ordered a sushi burrito with shrimp tempura -- the shrimp was stale. I would like to believe it was a bad batch. However, my friends ordered poke bowls and they seemed to enjoy it.The workers work well together and are very quick.> Yum! Was working from out of town and needed to grab a quick lunch nearby. Located in the seaport district, it was easy to find and a quick order using my Ritual app. The bowl was loaded and the sauce was tasty. One downside: there's no complimentary water..> This review is for the porter square location which doesn't have a yelp page yet...save your money and your time. I was excited to have a poke location close to home but They have a shortage of toppings to add into your bowl (granted you're limited to four) and the protein doesn't taste as fresh as what I've had at other places. Also, they barely add sauce to your bowl so it's lackluster protein without a sufficient amount of sauce to mask this issue. That being said, Ill head to pokeworks in Davis Sq. Comparable price point, more options, bigger bowls. Perhaps the underwhelming food is due to the recent opening but I wont be returning to find out.> Another Poke Place in the books for me! I got a Make Your Own Regular Cold Proteins with White Rice, Fresh Tuna and Salmon, Corn, Seaweed Salad, Red Onion, Sriracha Mayo, Tobiko and Jalapeno - which is typically my ""go-to"" range of flavors give or take a few things. I enjoyed it and it was fairly fresh. The one thing that my coworkers didn't like was you couldn't mix the hot and cold proteins which we didn't know about until we got there, so they were super bummed about that. Unlike a lot of places, this Poke place charges an extra dollar for Fresh Tuna, which I think is silly since almost none of the others do.It was a tasty poke bowl and filling, as is every poke bowl I've consumed to date from all over the country. Poke is honestly one of my favorite things to eat, so I would totally come back here if I were in the area. It definitely does not beat my favorite Poke place, but it works.","5, 3, 4, 2, 4"

We have been here a handful of times since moving to Boston and it's always a blast. We always get the D20, a random drink from one of twenty secret cocktails not on the menu. They give you a card to track how many of the 20 drinks you have tried, with even more secret options available to those that fill out the whole list. This has been a fun way to try cocktails we would never order on our own! We have three each so far, but we hope to try them all. The bar tenders wear dated outfits, and never break character. One even wears a monocle! Limited seating. We've never eaten there, but it's a full restaurant too. Parking may be difficult. Update: maybe we had one too many and started seeing monocles> So I've been coming to this place for the past 3 years consistently - hands down favorite restaurant in Boston. From the extraordinarily friendly staff, to the fun drink programs (proudly a DM2), and the amazing food, you feel at ease and almost at home every time you visit. I've only had amazing experiences at this place and always recommend Parla to everyone I know (and sometimes strangers when I can). I can't believe it took me so long to write a review for this place but I definitely recommend you stopping by for a drink, a bite to eat, or both! Also the music is always on point - just a spectacular atmosphere. I know I'm missing a lot and not providing crazy detail - check it out for yourself. My words won't be able to match your experience!P.S. Parla is the reason I like pickle backs now> The place to go if you want to be robbed. Went for a drink and apps. We got right in, took a while to have a waiter come over (about 15min), despite having two servers and a bar tender. We ordered apps and drinks when he came over. They came out and were great! The time to cash out came, got the check and spilt it. Christmas Day- woke up to find out the server added an extra $60 to my tip! Luckily I had saved the receipt and my credit card reached out and I was able to flag it. When we were leaving one of the waiters was saying they were all full with a 2 hr wait. The people started leaving and he goes 'tis the season'. Clearly it's the season for scamming their guests - happy holidays you thieves.> DINNER REVIEWMy girlfriend and I walked in here on Wednesday night around 8 PM for dinner and were seated immediately, right next to what would be the window but there was no window!). I had heard good things about this place and it seemed like they had some modern takes on classic Italian dishes. This is not your typical North End Italian restaurant.SETTING: This place is small and has a cute bar in the back. It maybe seats 20 people. You will definitely be able to hear the conversations of the people next to you so don't plan to come here if you're looking to have a private conversation.DRINKS: We didn't order any but I have heard great things about the drinks. They have this dice you can roll where each number corresponds to a drink so you can let fate choose your drink.FOOD: The menu is small for a North End restaurant (which I like) but it definitely has some things you wouldn't find on a classic old-school Italian restaurant menu (i.e. ceviche, patatas bravas, chicken & waffles). They also refer to a certain section of the menu as ""(Biggie) Smalls"" and they have a picture of Notorious B.I.G. So again, not your typical North End Italian restaurant.Fresh Burrata - You cannot go wrong with burrata and this was no exception. It came with fresh bread and tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. Would definitely order these again.Ricotta Fritters - These were yummy fried dough/cheese balls but there were only 4 to the serving which I thought was somewhat skimpy for $9. I would skip these.House Made Pappardelle - fresh pasta with a delicious homemade lamb ragu. My only wish with this was that it was a bigger serving.Overall, it was a great experience but I would want to check out other places in the North End before coming back. Don't come here if you're looking for huge portions.> We popped in when we saw two open bar stools to kill some time before a dinner reservation. We were happy it wasn't too crowded since it was Friday night (this place is tiny). All the staff we encountered were really great and bartender - really welcoming.Come here for the experience! From tossing and flipping cups to the outstanding old fashioned mustaches, this place is really unique. We tried the Dungeon Master game, where you roll a legit metal 20-sided dice across the bar for a surprise $15 drink. I rolled a Smoke in the Sunshine and it was good! I may not have picked this on a list so I'm happy it pushed me to try something new. We'll be back next time we are in Boston!","5, 5, 5, 1, 4"
