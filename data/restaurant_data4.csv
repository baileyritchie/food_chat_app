The Godfather and Cluck You are my favorites. Don't forget to buy yourself some homemade stuffed peppers on the way out.> Doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside, it's a bit of a visual sensory overload. There are music memorabilia all over, from pictures to figurines to records. Shelves of both contemporary and nostalgic candies and snacks basically line the walls from floor to ceiling. I placed an order for a meatball parm sub in the store and was...a little disappointed by the size and flavor. Another reviewer had said it was flavorful, but I didn't find it particularly so. I was still hungry after eating it but maybe that is attributed to me not eating since the day before. The girl behind the counter was friendly and the sandwich took probably 10 minutes to put together. I was looking for a traditional Italian but didn't see it amongst all the options; nevertheless, I'd be willing to try Roy's again for something else given its proximity to my friend's place.> You know how it is when you really want a meatball parm? Well that happened to me today and it was Roy's to the rescue. Even though I was lugging my rollaboard behind me, I made the brief detour from the Airport MBTA station to Roy's and got my sub. Roy's is take out only with a long counter and a bunch of coolers of sodas and drinks, but tables to eat here. I brought my sub back with me to the airport but didn't want to risk the TSA ""confiscating"" it, so I ate it at one of the tables in the airport.Very nicely packed, very delicious, the sub was well packed with proper sized meatballs, sauce and cheese. Excellent.The inside of the shop is very cool. Very well decorated with all sorts of rock and roll nostalgia, pictures of (I assume) Ray with rockstars as they've come through town and all sorts of other neat stuff. Well worth exploring as you're waiting for your fresh sub to be prepared.> I'm in a constant quest for the Greatest Meatball Parm Sub....So, this afternoon I told my nephew get in the car we're going for a little ride....Roy's was on my GPS ...Came through the tunnel ok but a lot of traffic in Maverick Sq.Arrived at Roy's and found parking pretty easy. Previous reviews said to order online.... I didn't heed the warning... we were greeted quickly and we ordered place our order....only one couple in front of us but still took a little while too get our sammy's... soon after us the place filled up.This is definitely a well loved neighborhood deli as locals came and went and we're greated by the owner!Overall - Very Solid Meatball Sub... can't wait to go back and try some of the other sandwiches!> So nostalgic walking in there. Reminds you of the good ole times back in the 90s. Great cheap food too. Go!","5, 4, 5, 4, 5"

PERFECT FOR CHRISTMASTIME because the ambiance is warm, beautifully appointed and, as the lobby of the Ritz Carlton, buzzy and full of cheer. There is a sleek fireplace on one wall, and great entertainment too. The bartenders crafted several holiday dessert cocktails which were divine. The wine list is well curated, too. Four stars because seating is limited and not as comfortable as the setting is inviting.> Soft opening was on 10/11/19 after renovation and making more space for seats. The bar is on the wall side not in the center anymore. Waiter and waitresses were very kind. Although the look of the fireplace and couches is very luxurious and gorgeous, but sitting here in not comfortable. I mean chairs and sofas are not meant for comfort. I always wonder why couches designers do this. It's not hard to design a comfy couch. This bar area and seats are the main lobby for the Ritz Carlton hotel. So it's designed more for people who come to drink more than the hotel patrons.  The dessert was so clean, perfectly small portion and very good. The water was delicious. The honey was amazing.> The room and music is why i gave 2 stars. the drinks were ehh. The food was microscopic and fair. What a great disappointment. I live in the city and im very disappointed. Save your money and go elsewhere> Avery Bar is sexy. Located in the lobby of the Ritz Carlton, the bar is horse shoe shaped, behind a fireplace. There are also tables and chairs if you prefer.The cocktail list is rather limited. It is called the ""Avery 10"" so there are only 10 cocktails. The cocktails are very well crafted though. I had no. 6, the harvest mule, which is a moscow mule. It was very well done. I also tried no. 2- gin & juice. you get a bottle of Hendrick's and a small pitcher of juice, and you mix the 2 together. Each cocktail is $15 a pop, definitely Ritz-Carlton prices.We were served mixed nuts and mustard pretzels. Those were delicious! Overall, a really nice bar that is pricey.> Cozy, modern, and for now what feels like a hidden gem in the Chinatown/Downtown area. Located in the Ritz-Carlton lobby, which means free WiFi for all. The specialty cocktail and food menu need a bit of developing (seemed a bit too ""old world"" for me--not every cocktail needs dark liquor and bitters, thanks) and the beer selection is kind of lame, but it's such a lovely space to spend time in that you'll be willing to overlook these things.

Jose was our server and he was just wonderful! The ambience is great and the noise level was pretty low. Everything from the popovers to the filet were fabulous! I had steak frites, which can be dangerous seeing as it's basically endless frites...so good! The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was wonderful as well. Jose, the staff and the overall experience was just wonderful for both my friend and I and we cannot wait to come back!> My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week~ great deal, I'm glad we tried it. I would come back for restaurant week but probably not any other time because of how expensive it is normally. The food wasn't terrible but it just wasn't amazing. I personally didn't like the popovers that they first bring out but my boyfriend enjoyed them. I ordered the hanger steak and he ordered the skirt steak. I ordered mine medium and maybe that was my mistake because it was a little too tough still for me. He ordered his medium rare and I thought it was really good. The greens and fries on the side are a nice touch, I really enjoyed the crispy fries. As for dessert I really enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding. Would recommend that one over the almond one my boyfriend got. Overall, this place is good but nothing spectacular. The atmosphere is nice and the service was decent, but again, just nothing special. Definitely recommend for restaurant week, though!> Very disappointed! I've been to the South End location several times and always had positive experiences so I expected the same at the Downtown location. My friends and I had a reservation for Friday and as we arrived we were asked to wait an additional 15 minutes although the restaurant was empty. We waited awhile for our server so we asked the host and he finally made his way over. The server did not offer us complimentary bread while we waited. The food took a very long time to come out. We only saw the server twice during our dine-in (to take our orders and deliver the bill).> I came in a party of four on a weekday evening for dinner. It was very crowded, luckily we had a reservation.I ordered the lobster ravioli, 10oz filet mignon, and the chocolate almond cake. The lobster ravioli was super delicious and flavorful! I wish it came with more raviolis! The sauce around the raviolis was also very savory and tasted great with the lobster. The filet mignon was very delicious! The meat was so rich and tender. The middle was perfectly pink! The almond cake tasted good after I removed the cherry layer. The service was pretty slow, and the food took a long time to come out. When the waitress was over, she was very friendly and helpful.Overall, we had a great experience and I definitely recommend this restaurant!> I had the day off today and was excited to go out to lunch with my mum. We've both never been to this steakhouse and was eager to try the food. My mum is a person who loves to eat beef, so I'm alway happy if I can find a great steak place for us to go to. Looking at the menu, we both decided to go with the 2 course power lunch. The options for the power lunch sounded appealing and we both ended up getting the lyonnaise salad, mum had the prime steak tips au poivre, and I went with the filet mignon.The lyonnaise salad, was very tasty. I enjoyed the bacon and the mushrooms. However, here are 3 pitfalls of the salad. One, the 2-hour egg on my salad, did not exist. It was a quarter of an egg white and no yolk. Basically, the egg was missing from my salad. (FYI, the picture of the salad was my mum's). Two, I ended finding an egg shell in my salad. Three, the parsley leaves needed to be cut down and sprinkled in my opinion. The parsley leaves were left as big leaves in the salad and I found that very unappealing. Though the salad dish obviously lacked in some qualities, overall was good.The beef dishes though was much better. Mum and I both enjoyed greatly our steak dishes and was very happy with the cook on the steaks. Also, our waiter Ricky was wonderful. He checked in on us and always kept our waters glasses full. I have yet to decide if I would want to come back again.","5, 3, 2, 4, 3"

The kabob was great! Typical middle eastern spices which was great. PTA was warm and soft and a real nice chew to it. The humans was fresh and amazing and the falafel was great. Literally everything it ate was great i highly recommend this joint if you are visiting Brookline in Boston. Some of you may be wondering why did I not give them five stars. I would have given them another half if I could but yelp won't allow me. The only down fall was the size of the plate and the price. The plate was too small and it felt like everything was on top of each other. I also got a potato Boorekas, which was really good. My total with a Bottle of water was over $18.00. For that price I should have gotten more kabob and Falafel. Again, if you like middle eastern food, this place has excellent flavors.> Fast, simple, delicious, (somewhat healthy?) food that is also pretty affordable.I've tried the falafel & hummus plate, shawarma & salad plate, and grill chicken pita.

My go-to has consistently been the muenster club, with applewood smoked bacon, guacamole, peppered turkey, and chipotle mayo.A side order of the truffle tots or tomato soup (slightly on the saltier side but goes great with the grilled cheeses) is a must, and my personal guilty pleasure (as if grilled cheese isn't enough by itself haha) is the rotating cereal shake! Love when they make it with fruit loops!Overall, a must if you're craving a hearty meal!> Great grilled cheese. Amazing poutine! I ordered the regular three cheese because that's what I was in the mood for, and plus I wanted to see how they do their classic. It was exactly what I wanted. Nothing fancy, just yummy melted cheese. It might be a little over-hyped. But it's still good! The soup is alright. Of course it goes well with the sandwich but I wouldn't get it again. It was roasted so maybe that's what I was tasting but it sort of had a canned flavor to it. Wish it had been brighter tasting instead. The poutine tho! It is so good and it has the proper amount of gravy. Don't skip out on it!! Oh and portions are good. Pretty big but not unreasonable.> I LOVE Roxy's! We stopped in on our way back from the MIT museum. Roxys has a great selection of burgers, hot dogs, and grilled cheese. They even have many vegan options! We ordered the truffle tots, Allston, and the LTO burger. The food was phenomenal! I can say without a doubt that it was the best burger I've ever r eaten. I really love whatever the Roxy sauce is! The business does NOT offer straws which is awesome!> The double fried chicken sandwich was exactly what I needed after a double header of workout classes at Heartbreak Hill next door. The buttermilk was a wonderful twist in the frying process! I also love getting grilled cheese sandwiches from here-especially the Mighty Rib melt with short rib and caramel iced onions and the Hot Honey bacon sandwich (self explanatory). For 3.50 you can upgrade to a combo and get a side and a drink. Great place to try :)> I've definitely seen and heard of this place a lot just walking around in Boston and also spotted their food trucks a few times. I decided to try it out one Friday and got the regular classic sandwich with truffle tater tots. Overall, the taste and texture of everything was pretty good! The 3 cheese mixtures blended well together and the bread was toasted to a buttery perfection. The tater tots held up their structure and were seasoned well too. Only thing is I feel like this is something really basic that I can just make at home and I can justify paying $6 for something that's basically just toasted cheese and bread. Don't get me wrong, this place is good but just not anything special for me. If anything, I would order one of their specialty sandwiches for something less basic and worth my money.","5, 5, 5, 5, 3"

And it is self-seated. So it is easy to find a table within a few minutes. The place seemed to be short of staff, within only one waitress running back and forth around 2pm on a weekday. But the service was not that slow. Within 10 minutes after we sat down, menus were brought to us. Another 10 or 15 minutes after we ordered, the food was brought to our table. Mine is plain steak tips with string beans and garlic flavored mashed potatoes. The waitress recommended me having the plain steak tips and she is absolutely right. The natural charcoaled flavor is just great. Even though I asked for the steak tips to be well cooked, they are not dry but juicy and tender! The garlic flavored mashed potatoes is not too garlicky so I don't have to worry about the smell. The string bean is a bit under cooked as it is just too crunchy for me. My husband ordered fish and chips. But his is definitely not good. The fish might have been fried too long, not crispy, but a bit burned and doughy. The chips are good though, thick, crispy outside but not dried out. It goes well with the mayo which we asked.For some reason, the clam chowder we ordered was never brought until the waitress came around asking if we needed anything else. I reminded her about the clam chowder. She then brought it. It was actually pretty good, fresh, hot, and with the taste of homemade.It is a good busy restaurant all in all.> I came here for dinner to use my Priority Pass $28 freebie (between 2-8PM) before a flight. Tried the fried haddock tacos which were perfectly crispy but a tad salty. However the accompanying pico and avocado was refreshing, and I appreciated the generous portion size. I also inhaled the clam chowder which was thick, creamy, and chock full of seafood. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, and it's probably the best food in the airport (however this is located pre-security so plan ahead). Service was lacking though since I was sitting at a high top table and being assisted by the bartender. Can't complain too much though since the meal itself was free. However I do not think I'd come without Priority Pass though since the prices are pretty steep overall.> Okay for an airport restaurant. Beer selection decent, food is mediocre. Prices are a bit on the high side. Unfortunately it's before TSA security so if you're there on a layover you have to exit and then get screened again by those wonderful folks at TSA. And everything TSA is so inconsistent from airport to airport it's mind boggling. I wonder if TSA has a manual or Standard Operating Procedures for their people. Lastly, I wish this restaurant knew how to spell ""Brussels Sprouts"". It's not ""Brussel"", it's Brussels. Come on guys, you're in the food business.> Like many airport places, I wouldn't come here unless you have priority pass (priority pass gets you $28 if you come between 2-8PM).Clam Chowder: Incredibly overpriced at $11 (above and beyond what you'll find even at a tourist trap like Quincy Market). Tasted good, thoughTempura Calamari: Comes with a pretty nice tartar sauce. Pretty tasty and well seasonedSteak Tips: Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was a little too sweet and completely well done (I asked for medium). The green beans and mashed potatoes were okay, though. You can tell the meat is pretty low quality, which would be fine except this dish was around $18.I guess I could expect as much, but everything is insanely overpriced here. The food is good enough (as in it is all edible), and I'm not complaining since I got it for free... the waitress seemed very busy with all the tables, but she was very courteous.> Bad service and long waits but food is ok. Used our priority pass here for 3 people. It's landside and they take quite a while so only come here if you have time to spare. You seat yourself, it's a bit disorganized. We were sitting for a while before anyone brought us menus. Our server was not good and made me upset...see below for the full experience. We got a Sauvignon blanc and Boston tea party cocktail (sweet tea and vodka, pretty strong). Food took a long time to come out.- Calamari: underseasoned but overall not too bad, peppers were nice- Chili: loaded with a super large scoop of sour cream and cheese, chips on the side were a bit stale. Tastes like chili out of a can but not horrible- Steak salad: steak was cooked pretty well but good flavor and overall the salad was good, solid choice- Southwestern salad: okay, nothing specialOverall, the food was about what I expected for a priority pass restaurant. I was fairly pleased until the end then I just got annoyed. The service could've been a lot better, considering that it's an airport and people are on a time crunch. Bad service--Our server never even asked us when our flight was or anything. It took a very long time to him to bring our check out. We had our priority passes on our phones so he had to take our phones to the counter I guess. We would've just given him our cards if it was such a hassle. He just really did not seem to care about giving good service. Our whole meal took about an hour and a half. Given this and our server's apathetic attitude, we did not provide a generous tip. The one time he actually paid us any attention was when we were giving tip. He eyed the exact amount we gave and proceeded to tell us what the customary amount should be in front of everyone. Wow. I've never had this happen before and was shocked at his audacity. I believe that tip is something that is earned for good service. If you don't provide good service, you don't get a good tip. I'm sorry but that's how it works, at least for me. I would've put up more of an argument if we had more time but obviously we spent all of our free time waiting for our food and check. Ugh. TL;DR: Food is ok, only come if you have priority pass and tons of time to spare. Don't expect good or even friendly service.","4, 3, 3, 3, 2"

They really have a variety of dishes and even have dinner specials where you get to try a few things like an egg roll, soup, rice, and a main entree within a reasonable price (less than $11). I ordered the Indonesian Fried Rice, which was seriously so flavorful. The rice was flavored with this spicy&sweet sauce that distinguished it from a regular fried rice that you get typically. The rice had a slight sticky consistency to it as well. On top of the rice, it was covered with crispy chicken which was as crispy as the name implies! Loved my dish I ordered - you can't go wrong with the Indonesian Fried Rice. In addition, one of their best selling points is how it's BYOB (bring your own beer) with no extra charge. It's a very casual vibe. Because of this, my friends and I were able to bring our own Trader Joe's wine and still enjoy the food here. Like I was saying, the menu is long and there were so many other items like their Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup, or Thai beef noodle soup that I'd like to come back for! Definitely one of my current favorite Thai places in Boston now.> I believe owner changed. And it's not good. Sad. It's a sad day for me. I hope you find this place to be better than what I have experienced today. I have been a faithful customer of this place where they started as an Asian and Thai grocery store that became a restaurant, 15 years or so. Some of you might know they used to have commercial refrigerates against the walls. It was our family sit down feel good and tasty Thai food place for many years, but it won't be any more.I ordered two orders of Thai fried rice with beef. It was bot tasty at all. The portion was so uneven that my dish was just enough for my 7 yo daughter and that 'a small. Just very small amount of rice and lots of onions and scallions that were not cooked and to make thing worse the beef was rubbery and it was clearly a frozen beef thawed without marinate nor seasoning. How do you mess up a fried rice in a Thai place? But they did and my wife didn't even finish Pad Thai because it was simply not tasty. She said it was just wet. Lastly, men's bathroom was dirty and smelly and the dishwashing areas was  just as smelly and dirty.  Prior owners had the bathroom clean and dishwashing area was always clean.  The toilet bowl was dirty. Inside and outside, trash can was dirty filthy. Now. I think I will stop here. Tempted to post bathroom pic but didn't. Thank you for reading.> Ordered takeout and ate about 45 mins later and the food was still good! I got the pad thai, fried rice with pork, red curry, crispy chicken basil, and water spinach. It came to around $70 which is crazy (especially since I know what this stuff costs IRL in Thailand) but eh, it's Brookline. I was most impressed by the curry and the fried rice with pork. The pork in the fried was pork belly which is delicious to begin with. The curry was smooth and rich. The other dishes were pretty standard. Nothing wrong with them, but also nothing particularly special about them.> I started coming here about 8 years ago. I remember after I had it once, I ended up coming back every day that week. I don't know what they put in their food, but it's addictive like crack! I normally get the pad Thai but I wanted to try something else and ordered their grilled pork fried rice. Omg, equally addictive. The grilled pork was marinated thoroughly and fried rice with the egg was moist. Their Thai iced tea is definitely the best I've had! I wish this was near my home. I'll probably be there 7 days a week.> Had the best Thai takeout from Dok Bua that I am itching to try a sit down meal there too! What caught my interest is how vast their menu is. Got Moo Yang - this flavorful saucy grilled pork - and Chicken Rice Soup to start. Both of these were delicious and signaled great things for our entrees.I got the Yum Woon San Salad because it's my way of eating healthy (it's a salad...made of noodles!). Ground pork, shrimp, peanuts, chili sauce & lime - what's not to love. The Boy got the Chicken Fried Rice Dinner Special & he loved. If you spend a certain amount you have your choice of a free app or another (grubhub) too so that was nice. 10/10 will be eating Dok Bua again!","4, 1, 3, 5, 5"

Well, I actually stumbled upon this place. I was recommended to go to ""Howl at the moon"", but it wasn't my vibe. I was looking for something with a little bit of culture, something my speed. Looked up some reviews and saw this good be the place for me.This club was fire! You want culture come here. They played Latino music, afrobeats, hip hop, trap music, etc. I paid a $15 cover charge and got there around 11:45pm. Also, they have $5 mystery drinks (which is a plus)... You're also free to come and go as you please, they'll give you a stamp on your wrist.So, why not 5 star? Although, it was lit and people were absolutely wonderful... people were wild bro. At some point I couldn't dance anymore because we were packed like sardines. Then, these fools started mosh pitting and I was ready to fight, lol. No one was keeping a check on these people. On a serious note: come to sweat, get drunk and have an good time.> I'm reviewing solely based on ordering lunch from here via the Ritual app. I searched Ritual for tuna poke because, well, I love fresh tuna and could eat it for every meal. Imagine my surprise when Good Life popped up on the list for tuna poke bowls. I was a little reticent to order it, but I really wanted some tuna poke and I decided to give it a try. It may have also been 5x the points on Ritual and I'll do almost anything for a free meal...so there's that.Guys - this was really good! My only complaint is that the rice is often a tad crunchy. I can't tell if it's underdone or maybe even a tad overdone. I've ordered this dish a few times now and I keep coming back because honestly the tuna is super fresh and the sriracha mayo they serve with it is addictive. There are delicious slices of avocado and mango and it's all super fresh. Seriously, wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. A downside, it's $15.00 and that's pretty steep for a lunch...even in downtown Boston. However, the price point hasn't stopped me from ordering this dish multiple times.> Great spot to pop in for lunch, dinner, drinks, etc! During the day it was filled with people having lunch and enjoying each other's company, which is always nice. The wings were delicious, the Mac and cheese was simple but tasty, and the short rib sandwich was a nice flavor. The tuna poke bowl was really delicious. Not the traditional poke bowl, but really filling yet light none the less. Drinks are definitely on the stronger side, and cocktails are $12. Service was great, attentive without being overwhelming. Overall, a good spot to stop in for a bite and some good company!> To be black in Boston is to find it VERY difficult to find clubs or bars to cater to you. This being said:  The food is good bar food and I often go with my friends to grab a bite after work. Depending on when you go, they have a cover of $0-$15.This is as close as it will get to basement vibe parties. If you remember going to house parties where it was dark and you could have fun and dance, this is for you. I would go online and check to see if they have a guest DJ which did happen once and it was the worst night. This was an isolated event though. There is a bar in each room. There are two rooms on the first floor and one room in the basement. The first floor is always playing throwbacks and major hits that anyone can enjoy. The basement plays top 40, afrobeats, reggae, hip-hop, r&b, etc. There is something for almost everyone.You can show up dressed in pretty much anything so I've gone dressed up or dressed down. You can get in with sneakers! I have definitely sat for a late dinner and then sat around to talk while they cleared out the tables to start off the night. I got tired of having to dress up for disappointing Boston nightclubs but this is just a comfortable outing.They always have $5 mystery drinks that are my go-to!> I came here for a Trivia Factory night and ordered a dinnet special: ribeye with roasted brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The food was cooked well but none of it had flavor, almost like water. There was little to no seasoning. My friend who was with me also had the same thing with his dish as well.","4, 3, 4, 4, 2"

Courtney helped us out at the bar. She was great! Made the drinks strong! (Hurricane on the tap and crown Apple with cranberry) Had a light convo with us and the food came out quick for a game night! Wasn't crazy packed but the space is big.I had buffalo wings and my friend had the Chicken BLT with fries. My wings were great. My friend said his sandwich was alright.

I'd definitely go back. I was expecting the dishes to be more spicy than oily though. Otherwise, such a great place to get some good food. Don't pass on the corn. Such a great dish, would eat this every day.> This place is solid.Easy to get to as it's just outside the Central Square Red line T stop on Mass Ave.It gets pretty busy on weekends so plan accordingly.Menu is pretty robust with all the usual Chinese/Szechuan options. I went with the Fried Beef with Chili Rice and my friend went with the Szechuan Spicy Tofu. Both were very good. I would say it's some of the better Chinese food I've had in Cambridge.Wait staff is very busy but amenable. They get you the food pretty fast.Overall I recommend this place. It'd be better to go with more people so you can share many dishes, etc.> I came here around 1pm on a Saturday for lunch with a woman who not only frequented the restaurant, but also is Chinese and fluent in the language. For those reasons, I think I had an ""insider"" experience which panned out to be better than most. My companion ordered from the buffet looking area where you choose ingredients and have them cooked on the spot - a very wonderful option if I do say so. She went the spicy route and the dish included beef, shrimp, cilantro, a black ear looking mushroom, lotus root, squid, and I believe another vegetable. It was absolutely divine. From the menu we also ordered green beans and bamboo tips and each had a side of rice. The food was delectable and came out extremely fast. They aren't messing around. It's a small restaurant and quite popular so be prepared to sit at a table with other folks if there are no available booths. There is also definitely an advantage to knowing Mandarin, but I mean... You are in China Town. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would most definitely come again. Such good food, and not outreagously expensive for the area.> So many choices of restaurants in China Town. We randomly picked Five Spice House for lunch. A small dining room that filled before we finished. But then I noticed they have an upstairs. A very yummy meal. Prompt, friendly service.> I came with a group of friends who weren't that into family style so it's tough for me to gauge the full spectrum of what Five Spices House has to offer. That being said from what I did have, I am not rushing back to give it another go when there are so many other places around Chinatown that deserve a shot.The main reason for this is because I got the Beef Noodle Soup - a classic Chinese dish that can tell eons about a restaurant. Their bowl was filled to the brim and not skimping on the beef bits and veggies but the noodles were terribly overcooked and the broth was incredibly greasy - literally all oil on the top - and not that flavorful. Very disappointing. Also not spicy.The spiced duck tongue were pretty good although severely lacking in spice despite how many chilies are given to you (seriously where is the spice people, not even any 'ma'/numbing feels) ... I ate the chilies straight and was unfazed which should not have been the case. The duck tongues were plentiful though.","4, 4, 4, 4, 2"

I got the ktown throw down, which had marinated chicken, greens, scallions, etc. I added more sriracha for extra spiciness. The ordering system is fast and convenient--there are a few iPads that you can order through and see what each dish contains. There are also several employees there if you have questions. You can also order ahead for pickup, for those who are on a tight schedule. The portions are huuuuge, definitely enough to share or save as a second meal.> Update.    I am baffled by this place.  Came in at 2:30pm.  I am the only one here.  4 people working here.  Ordered a Pho and it took 15 minutes?!  This takes about 3 minutes in the food truck with 1 or 2 workers.  I am not willing to come back for an actual lunch hour even though I like the food.Like their food a lot, but disappointing at times.  Today I was in a rush. Ordered online and came 15 minutes later.  There was nobody in the store and worker was just hanging out.  I asked for my online order and then he Started making it... defeats the point of pre-ordering..> + Ali's Pho - Chicken pho with noodles, chinese salt and pepper, cabbage, bean sprouts, red onion, cilantro, scallions, crispy shallots, and a slice of lime. Tasty and decent portions.+ Quick service.+ Self order on a tablet option.- Lukewarm broth.- No tray provided when order served.- Limited dine-in seats.> They just ALWAYS get my order wrong. (I only go here when I pick up food from Viga) I have really given them multiple chances at this point. The people are nice but they definitely don't have enough staff for busy lunches. I get the food truck fav with deviled tea eggs. Half the ingredients were missing from the bowl (no shallots, scallions, or vinaigrette) and so was the tea eggs I ordered. I'll just go to the little cart in Copley. Rule of thumb here: ALWAYS double check your order.> Bon Me is a great lunch spot in the Back Bay. I like to keep it local and we were very excited when they brought their food truck fare to the brick and mortar location. Some of the ingredients change up a bit over time, but there are always items of a similar theme (always some type of chicken on the menu for example).  I love the noodle salad and get it every time. I like the various spicy options that are available. The restaurant is on the Ritual app so you can order ahead to try to avoid the lines. The app also lets you add comments so you can customize things a bit. When in the city for work, I hit Bon Me roughly once a week and never tire of the choice. The couple of things that hold me back from a five star rating are occasional order accuracy issues and their limited drink options.","4, 2, 3, 4, 2"

I enjoy Bon Me in general however this specific time I went to try the ramen, As far as ramen goes there are a ton of places that do it better. While the portion size is big, the broth flavor is a little to tangy for me. The eggs are just boiled and are not the traditional tea egg. The noodles are average at best. I would not go here for ramen again. The rice and noodle bowls that I have had previously are really good though and this is something I would come back for. When visiting this specific location it seems very spacious and clean. It was empty when we went but I am sure it gets busy during the week around lunch time,> pretty good fusion asian food. Simple ingredients but tasty combo. Each with traditional tastes but in interesting combinations of ingredients in each concoction. Had kimchee pork ramen and Bon Me. Recommended for a fast food or light lunch.> I was a huge fan of the food truck when they first started out. Fresh ingredients and veggie options, what's not to love? I didnt really like the menu changes, but that's ok, I just didnt order them! I work near this location and had a craving for their Thai Basil lemonade so I braved the lunch rush. I went up to the counter and quickly made my order. The guy pours my drink and...tells me to wait in line with everyone waiting for lunch. I wait for 5 minutes before I cant stomach it and ask the guy at the end for my drink.Still the fastest food truck, but the storefront processes could use work.> Bon Me is a great place to go for a quick bite that is healthy and uses whole ingredients. I don't love how they use cilantro like lettuce, but I break off the amount I want before eating, or you could order without it. The menu is simple, get the sandwich thing, the rice thing or the salad thing...pick a protein...pick a spice...wait five minutes and you're good to go! The price is about average for takeout lunch in the area and they do a quick turnaround so they typically have a line, but don't get discouraged.","4, 3, 4, 3, 4"

I think it's ridiculous that Efraim S. limited his review to 4 starts. I've eaten with him here and he always raves about it. He is scared about looking desperate on Yelp but he's a coward. If the felafel dog is truly the best, then why not give it five stars? Is there some superior felafel dog out there? No.Also, he has shit grammar and it's impossible to decipher what he is writing. His review is beyond comprehension. This is all from a Harvard Business a School student. The dude needs to get his shit together. This place is healthy and fantastic.> My advice to Whole Heart: don't advertise something if it's never available. The last 4 times I've gone to Whole Heart the artichoke toast is not available. This review went from two stars to four stars though because, although my avocado toast took way longer to prepare than you it should have (20+ min) - even people after me were being served first - one of the staff gave me a coupon and admitted that it took way too long, which is great-- admitting fault is a great way to keep customers.> If you're considering stopping by Whole Heart Provisions, just do it. And when you go, order the Cassie Bowl (8.85) with miso bbq tofu (+2) because it's the best and none of the other ones (while still good) have compared. The Cassie Bowl comes with japanese eggplant (so freaking tasty, and this is coming from a once eggplant hater), chickpeas, pickled cauliflower (the perfect crunch and sour contrast), savory green beans, basil (yes yes yes), currants (I'm all about the hint of sweetness), crispy chickpeas, and creamy harissa sauce. The warm bbq tofu adds protein and extra sauciness to the already delicious bowl. I've had this combination at least 10 times since January, and I'm still constantly craving it. Do yourself a favor and check out Whole Heart Provisions.On a side note, I've tried several other bowls including the Mission, the Viet, and Miso, the Levant, and the Kaya (okay, so almost every other option), and none were quite as delicious as the cassie. That said, the falafel is really good, and sometimes if I'm feeling wild I'll get The Cassie with falafel instead of bbq miso tofu.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

Amazing amazing amazing Brazilian food (although I admit to being no expert) with knock-your-socks-off flavors and great, fresh seafood. I highly recommend the fish and shrimp muqueca (signature dish, seafood stew served in a clay pot) as well as the mariscada (similar idea with squid and mussels and crabmeat, but cooked in coconut milk). Portions are generous and even the rice is soft and fluffy and delicious. I think most of their dishes are served with a side of fish gravy, which is so delicious I always want to lick the bowl it comes in. They also offer an excellent, super spicy hot sauce if you ask, and we got a small side of plantains as well as yucca flour to top our dishes with. Entrees will run $20-25 each.Service is friendly and fast, the decor is fine -- comforting but not high-end or anything. Bathroom was clean. And small protip -- if you come for brunch / during lunchtime, they do have coffee for $2, even if it's not on the menu.> We had much higher expectations than our experience turned out to be.Walked in on Tuesday night around 7pm, with 2-3 tables taken. The interior looked nice. Our server was Linda - not the most welcoming person, very presumptuous and conceited. She seemed to already have a plan for what we needed to get. Linda didn't even listen to the end of our order. I was almost afraid to give her an order, leaving alone asking for recommendations. Linda tried to upsell couple of dishes as well, which I would consider under regular circumstances, but not there. I did though get a fish and shrimp moqueca, instead of just fish which I ordered and everyone at our table heard that. Mind you, it's $4 more than a fish one. And I would have never ordered shrimp, as we have a severe shrimp allergy in our party. Obviously, I would have indicated we can't have shrimp, had anybody inquired about it. Nope, didn't happen. I'm glad nobody suffocated in that restaurant to date and they didn't have any law suits for trying to kill people by putting in their food severe allergens in order to gain extra $4.When I got my dish and saw shrimp, I was just so disappointed,  as that dish took a long  time to be prepared. Nobody came to check whether our food was ok. By that time, there were only 2 tables left in the restaurant. We also never got hot sauce although we asked for it repeatedly.Fried yucca and house salad were both good. You can't go wrong with fried yucca anywhere. Fish and chips were soft and soggy, bland. Fish was a real fish to their complement, I think haddock. Not some type of fish meal with almost no fish. In addition, their fish sauce served with moqueca is truly appalling. Never coming back. Avoid.> I had high expectations of this place and it left me disappointed. The caipirinhas were a bit on the sweet side, but still delicious nonetheless. The food was honestly a bit lackluster - it wasn't particularly memorable. Salt was needed in multiple parts on my dish, from the fried fish to the potatoes. My friends had similar comments for their dishes. Service was pretty good overall though - our waitress was very warm and welcoming. Just wish the food was as well!> Everything from the caipirinha (similar to a mojito But sweeter) to the fried shrimp and fish appetizers ,to the fish and shrimp muqueca was absolutely delicious. The Muqueca was beautifully served in a clay pot.  The flavors from this regional dish are rich and unlike anything found at other area Brazilian restaurants. The service was attentive and friendly. They patiently answered all our questions and made recommendations that were spot on. I finished with the passion fruit custard, easily the most exquisite custard I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try their other dishes.","5, 5, 2, 3, 4"

I had the carnitas taco and cod taco, both outstanding. The spicy mango salsa and pickled onions went so well with the fish tacos. A total recommended!!> The food is great if you can even get it, I placed an order through door dash and when the guy arrived to pick up the food the place was closed. Then of course the restaurant had no one answering phones (probably due to being closed while taking my money for orders). Door Dash has not refunded me the $60 plus dollars for this order.> Food is good, but customer service is ATROCIOUS. I ordered from Postmates 2  bowls (one shrimp and one fish), and what arrived was one burrito. The sticker on the bag had my order correct, but the food was not. My angel of a Postmates driver said, not to worry, she would grab the right order, and asked if I could just call in advance. Ohhhh lordy. I called and was first told that my Postmates order didn't exist, even though i had just received a Postmates order (albeit wrong). Then I was told very rudely that I didn't order properly, that I didn't say if it was a bowl or a burrito, or tacos, or enchiladas, etc.. I explained that I didn't WRITE the order I clicked a button from THEIR menu. She yelled at me for a bit about that.  She then yelled that I needed to bring back the burrito...no problem lady, my Postmates girl is on it. She then hung up on me. 5 minutes later I got a call from the angel Postmates driver saying that the restaurant has agreed to make 1 bowl, but is refusing to make my other bowl....so i text her my receipt which clearly indicates that I've paid for two bowls... doesn't matter. Postmates Corporate gets involved and speaks to the owner of Achillitos and he is now getting yelled at, and they STILL won't make my bowl. My poor Postmates driver had to leave because they were yelling at her in the store and she was afraid she was going to get out. Me, my Postmates driver, and the man from Postmates Corporate are all totally baffled as to what happened, and why, but take my advice, NEVER order out from Achilitos!> I've been dying for good pupusas to make they're way to Roslindale / JP area , so I was excited when I saw a nice big sign outside this place. I'm vegetarian and was delighted to see the many options they had, when I went to order they literally had only one type of pupusa (chicharrón) just my luck! My boyfriend got two with the Cole slaw and sauce and he was not a fan. The pupusa was extremely greasy and curtido and sauce it comes with was so small.  The place overall was very nice and looked clean  but the staff needs better management & better costumer service.> Carnitas burrito was absolutely delicious.Pork was cooked and seasoned perfectly as was the rice and beans","4, 1, 1, 2, 5"

The majority of our group wanted linguine Vongole, so we really just wanted a place that had it on the menu. The atmosphere was reminiscent of an Italian restaurant somewhere, not quite the typical small north end restaurant.We started with Caesar salad and fried mozzarella, both of which were great - classic, but done well. We also all picked at the bread, which we really enjoyed was focaccia slices in the basket. For our lunch, we ordered two linguine Vongole dishes, which we asked to be split (4 plates) in the kitchen. The half serving of Vongole was perfect and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, which was great. The ravioli was served in a cream sauce with pieces of lobster in the center of the plate. We did not have dessert, as we all wanted a cannoli from a certain bakery, but everything we ordered was delicious.> We drove up from NY so could not make a reservation as we did not know what time we would arrive.  It was around 9 pm on Friday night so we walked until we found a place with seating.... Florentine was that place The tables are super tiny with very large bases so zero room for your feet.... and I'm 5'2""!   It was pretty crowded and the staff and guests bump into your chairs constantly.  I can live with that. We ordered the antipasto plate to start.   It looked great except for the mound of tuna fish. I don't eat canned tuna and don't like the smell.... I've never seen canned tuna on an antipasto plate!  I am gluten free for medical reasons but was planning to throw my health to the wind for this one night... I wanted pasta!  I also can't eat nightshades so no tomatoes, so I ordered ziti with chicken and broccoli in a white wine garlic sauce. The plate came out with a mountain of Parmesan cheese all over it.  I do not like Parmesan... it smells like feet to me...   When I asked the waitress she told me she put the cheese on... and added extra!  ( she was very proud of that point!). I said I don't like Parmesan... she said everyone that comes in there loves lots of cheese which is why she dressed my plate for me.  And walked away. I tried to scrape it off. Then I tried to mix it in.  It was just overwhelming. I don't like Parmesan cheese.  When the waitress came back later she asked how the meal was and I said I don't like Parmesan cheese... so she offered me a dessert. I said that I wanted my dinner.  She offered to bring me a new entree but at that point it was 20 minutes later and I wasn't about to wait and eat by myself after my boyfriend was done with his meal. She did take my entree off the bill.  Overall this place is just weird.  The tuna fish... the staff seasoning your food....    With the other options in the neighborhood I would suggest to going elsewhere.> My husband and I stopped in for drink and I must say it was quite the experience.As soon as we sat down the bartender named manny made sure we felt welcomed. My husband ordered a negroni and loved it, I didn't know what to order manny recommended a drink called 333 and it was amazing. We stayed for second round   And ordered some apps the food was Great place overall Fantastic service> Cozy and quaint yet bustling atmosphere. Great location right on Hanover street. Tables were small and squished close together. Lots of people and crowded at the bar. Mixed ages (mainly mid 20s at the bar, which is my age). Food was good but nothing to write home about. Cocktails were good and strong. Wine list was a little lacking, as many of the bottles were ones you would find at the store like Josh and cupcake. Everything was pretty reasonably priced. Would be likely to come back for a casual cocktail, but more likely to try a new dinner spot than return here to eat.> Florentine Cafe has that extra, something- something. Every time my sister and I go here we end up having the best time. The environment is dark and moody, the drinks are outstanding, the environment is fun and lively, and the location is in the middle of the North End/Little Italy=prime real estate. Every time my sister and I are dining in the area, we grab a drink at Florentine. Last time I was there they had pineapple infused vodka that they served in a martini glass. To my dismay, they didn't have that this time around but they did redo their cocktail menu and they offered great Aperol and Campari spritzes. As I prefer bitter/tart over sweet, I ordered a Campari spritz and my sister ordered a glass of Rosè. We were fortunate enough to find two seats at the bar, before the place really started packing in. I remember the last time we were there, the music was a little bit more lively and louder, this was a little bit more subdued but still a fun environment. I've never tried food here but I do believe they have a solid menu. I'll save that for my next visit. For whatever reason, this has become a staple in our North End routine, I definitely recommend enjoying a drink here along the way as there is so much to do in the area. I recommend using a rideshare service because parking is difficult in this area. Enjoy!","4, 2, 4, 3, 4"

I was not expecting to really have a great experience here but I have zero complaints. Decent price too for Boston. Sat at the bar with my laptop and there was even a plug there where the bar meets the wall. Generous wine pour.> For how fancy this place is, I would expect it to be better.Don't get me wrong - I devoured my entire plate (scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries), but I also hadn't eaten anything. It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't the most amazing breakfast food I've had. The eggs needed more seasoning. The sausage and potatoes were delicious, though.The ambiance is obviously really nice - I went with 3 other moms and we all wanted a kid-free environment. This delivered. It was so nice to have a quiet, calm conversation!Our server was very nice and service was quick. We finished with plenty of time to get to our show. So if you're looking for a place to eat before seeing a play, I'd recommend it.And the bowl of Lindt chocolates on the way out was a special treat. :)> So I'll be honest--we came from the Public Garden Park and really had to pee. Starbucks was packed so we stumbled upon this joint. Lucky find!We weren't SUPER hungry so we had gotten starters, but we were happy with our find!This Beacon Hill spot leads to a very quaint part of the neighborhood near the famed ""Acorn Street"".Today is Labor Day so business was not as usual and they had such a busy weekend they were missing menu items. Nonetheless, food was pretty good! I highly recommend the Grilled Flatbread. Between the mozzarella, marinara, and basil, I was in heaven Also, the bathrooms are clean and are downstairs, in case you were wondering!> I'm incredibly hesitant to write this review and expose this spot for fear that it'll, too, become teeming with people on the weekends. This place gets 5 stars for its lovely brunch service because they have consistently well-executed food, consistent service, and you. can. always. get. a. table. Some may think this is a bad thing, but truly, it's only bad if the food isn't fresh or service isn't good, or some other terminal flaw. It's really just a hidden gem, tucked away in plain sight on Charles. I love trying out new hot spots but sometimes you wake up on a weekend morning and just don't feel like waiting in line to get a table. You want your food, and you want it now! If that's the case, come to BHB. TL;DR: You're not going to find fruity pebbles crusted french toast stuffed with nutella here, but you can get a damn good benny and you can get it without waiting.> I walked by this place so many times and didn't know it existed. I randomly found it one day on Yelp and decided to come for brunch. It's a typical hotel restaurant and the interior is very classy. Lots of natural light streaming in from outside and it gives the inside a very clean, refreshing look.I ordered the French toast and a side of beef hash. Boyfriend ordered the vanilla pancakes and the same side. My French toast was delicious. Every bite had something else in it besides just the toast. The beef hash was amazing. I took a bite of the hash after a bite of the toast and almost wanted to stop eating the toast so I could just keep eating the hash. Very flavorful and the brussel sprouts were cooked pretty well. I got OJ and it was freshly squeezed. Although at $4 for a not-so-large cup of it, I'd probably skip next time. Boyfriend liked both his dishes as well.Staff was fast and attentive. Until at the end when our check came out. There was a mistake and we were charged the wrong price for an item but it was quickly fixed. Would definitely come back again for the food.","5, 3, 4, 5, 4"

Can get a little messy but they have bathrooms. The menu was kind of restricting because I always end up getting the beast but makes it easier to choose. The frappes are huge but wish they had whipped cream. They usually give you the mixing cup and another cup for the shake. Staff are friendly and the music is like stuff you would hear at Johnny Rockets. The seats remind me of five guys. They have cups for water and you can just go up to refill. It's pretty empty when I go there too.I feel like the music changed a little and the fries are thicker. Still no whipped cream. And they switched to a smaller plastic cup.> I remember seeing the food truck up in Portland but didnt have time to give it a try. Now I can sit and enjoy their food, which I much prefer. Service, food, and atmosphere are very good. They use high quality ingredients so the prices reflect that. Keep in mind that the burgers can get a bit soggy and messy near the last few bites so have those napkins ready.> TL;DR High quality burgers but too pricey for what you get. I ordered Mainely Burgers on Grubhub because they had an offer of 35% off your order. We were going to eat locally, but I thought this made it a decent deal. I ordered the Mainah while my boyfriend got the Coop. We also split an order of truffle fries. I believe this originally would have been $25. The Mainah was really good. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The toppings were good but relatively tasteless. I got this to go, and when I ate it about 15 minutes later everything was soggy. The bun was falling apart and the apples lost their crunch. I tried my boyfriends burger and it was much better with the fried egg and again cooked perfectly. The truffle fries ($4.25) were good but soggy. They don't have size options. I also thought based on photos they would come with cheese but they only come with truffle oil. Their condiments also cost extra so I had to use the extra mayo from my burger. We demolished our burgers so they were definitely good, but definitely not worth the $9.25+tax. If you do come here make sure to eat in, because everything would have been better fresh. I will also say based on ordering online it appears that they take allergies seriously which is great!> I'm not a big fan of burgers, but decided to check out this place. It's a new location and in a neighborhood where parking is much easier than driving into Boston, phew.We ordered the Shroom' & Swiss burger with a double veggie patty. It came, as the name suggests, with sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese, along with lettuce, tomato, and house sauce. The veggie patty was unlike any I've tried in the U.S. It's a green patty (usually it's always black bean or at the most sweet potato), so it felt great to try something different. While it was tasty, I feel it lacked salt. However, you can make up for it with the various sauces. So I didn't mind! This way, it is more accessible to those who prefer a low salt intake. We ordered the parmesan fries as a side. The fries were crispy but I could have done with a lot more parmesan, haha.The ambiance is pretty sunny and open. Quite a lot of seats and no wait time. You order at the counter and the food is ready in minutes.Pro tips -1: Free parking on the street.2: Check out the Boston mural on their wall.3. So many burger options, they also have temporary specials - check out the far right menu board.4: If you get their veggie patty, ask them to top it with some Sriracha!> On par with Wahlburgers. Mediocre and expensive. Fast casual burger joint hailing from Maine trying to break into the burger industry against the likes of Five Guys, Burger Fi, Shake Shack etc who do it better.$16.25 for a Mainah burger (apple slices, bacon, cheese, sauteed onions, maple mayo), brussel sprouts, and soda. I also got lettuce, onion, tomato on my burger and a side of spicy Thai mayo. I ordered my burger medium rare and got it well done unfortunately. The brussel sprouts we're crispy but oh so greasy. Each bite was a burst of grease in my mouth. My fellow diners ordered the beast beef burger with an egg and it was a hard Sunny side up sadly. The veggie burger was a green patty of mush, flavorful by itself but tasteless mess in the coop (pickled onions, spicy mayo, egg). The chicken burger was small but the chicken breast was still moist. Their fries are interesting. They're crispy and kinda hollow. The truffle version they toss the fries in light truffle oil and they come very shiny. An expensive mediocre burger with mediocre sides. They don't have the rhubarb drink here like they do at the Central location.","4, 4, 3, 4, 3"

In the middle of the Covid era, though, I thought it was time to leave a review, since I was blown away by the quality and service of their takeout brunch. To expedite everything, they only take online orders (though someone was available over the phone if you had questions), and the platform is easy to use and SUPER customizable (every side option/addition is available and it's easy to specify what you want). We selected a time for pickup and had to wait just a few minutes past that time.We drove home smelling deliciousness and when unpacked our bag, everything was well packaged and condiments (ketchup, butter, syrup) were separated from the dishes so nothing ran together or got soggy. The food was still top notch - the roasted vegetable omelette was a great size, the vegetables were all cooked really well and incorporated into the omelette, and the homefries were well seasoned. The blueberry lemon french toast was truly melt in your mouth and had definitely held up through travel. We didn't need the syrup on top. The prices are still Cafe Luna prices, but I think feels cheaper when you're not in store ordering a drink/coffee. I'm really impressed at their service and quality even in this challenging time and we're hoping we can keep supporting them!> Excellent brunch. I highly recommend to go in a group and share plates. We ordered:- Lemon ricotta pancakes (our fav. The pancakes melt in your mouth)- Chocolate raspberry French toast (all of their French toast is made with cinnamon swirl bread! Incredible flavors. This was another fav but is pretty heavy so be prepared)- Corned beef hash omelet with fruit on the side (great, but not as good as the other dishes)- Surf n' turf eggs Benedict (one with lobster the  other with sirloin) with home fries on the side - super yummy!- grilled biscuit with honey butter (SO GOOD but not pictured!)- matcha latte - vanilla latte- orange juiceThe drinks were over priced in our opinion ($4-5 each) for their quality, but the dishes were definitely worth their prices.None of the above dishes had nuts in them!> Amazing food with great service, every time I  went there was super happy with service and can't stop talking about how great and memorable they make each visit. Even though there is a wait on the weekends it's totally worth it!!! :)Fantastic!!!> As a huge brunch fan who lives nearby, I've been to Cafe Luna several times now. On each occasion, I've made it a point to arrange a reservation beforehand. The wait can last over an hour, especially on the weekends. If you're thinking about booking, you can do so here: resy.com/cities/bos/cafe…Their extensive brunch menu has something for everyone -- a mix of both healthy and indulgent dishes. Looking back, I haven't had a meal here that I disliked! My personal favorites include:// fig, prosciutto & goat cheese omelet - $15balsamic marinated figs, goat cheese, leeks and prosciutto// house specialty lemon ricotta pancakes - $16topped with fresh berries and lemon curd// roasted vegetable breakfast bowl - $15quinoa with roasted vegetables, caramelized onion, sunflower seeds, avocado, and two eggs// house made corned beef hash plate - $16with two poached eggs and toast or home friesProTip: Unlimited coffee refills!!> Definitely get a reservation ahead of time! If you don't, you're likely looking at a long wait.  The seating includes shared tables, particularly for smaller groups. The food at Café Luna is definitely indulgent! If you wish you were eating dessert instead of breakfast, try any of their sweet options. Otherwise they have tons of Benedicts, omelets, and a excellent looking Mac and cheese. We split the chocolate raspberry churro french toast and it was still too much for either of us to finish. It was fried cinnamon sugar french toast smothered in chocolate, some form of ricotta, and TONs of raspberries.We also split the biscuits. They have one meat option for each biscuit, with an egg and a fig jam. We got one spicy chicken and one hash. The spicy chicken was amazing! The meat in the hash was a too stringy and the flavor was lost in the mashed up potato. The jam was a somewhat confusing addition. Overall, I'd recommend getting spicy chicken and dropping the jam if you get the biscuits. The prices are high, even for Cambridge. They clearly use fresh, high quality ingredients. However, you're looking at $20-30 for an eggs Benedict or $15-20 for pancakes/french toast.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

The calamari ras hanout sounded amazing but wasnt crispy like I like my fried calamari, it had a soggy texture. The harissa aioli was really yum though.The kebab pasta was good! The chicken was very flavorful, and the pasta had vodka sauce on it. I was expecting moroccan flavor in the pasta, but it was just regular vodka sauce. Not bad but not what you would expect here.The grilled mixed kebab was very good too! Got chicken and lamb and they were both tasty. It came with veggies, salad, rice and 2 dips. We got tzatziki  and spicy feta.Overall would come back for the atmosphere, but not dying to have the food again.> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. They took my reservation over the phone than told me when I got there that they don't accept reservations and turned my party of 12 away. They also recently implemented a dress code but did not tell me over the phone or post it on the website -- again turning my party of 12 away. Horrible management, horrible customer service. I will never attempt to go here ever again. The response I got when I asked for an exception- ""you can write an email to the owner tomorrow""> My friend & I decided to checkout the hookah at Tangierino on a Saturday night and we doing out their hookah lounge is called Koullshi. So we decided to head there. The bouncer at Koullshi, I think his name is Yassir looked at my ID but was an absolute prick to my friend. The bouncer denied us entry without even looking at my friends ID and she had multiple forms of ID. We went back to the restaraunt to speak to the manager so the manager of the restaurant called Tauheef the manager of Koullshi and got us entry. We went back to the hookah joint and the bouncer dead ass said he was not going to let my friend enter and went down to speak to Tauheef cane up back up and said he was not going to let us in. So we asked him to let us speak to the manager Tauheef but HE STOOD THERE DID NOT MOVE & TOLD US HE HAD CALLED THE MANAGER & THAT WE HAD TO WAIT. Like wth kind of service and attitude is this. Mind you my friend had been in before so this was an absurd situation. At this fine my friend was done she didn't even care but I wanted to speak to the owner of the place or the manager! So I go in to speak to the manager or the Owner Samad and the manager asks me to wait outside. He comes back up and we have a convo he says he'll deal with the bouncer but does not let me speak to the owner. The bouncer was an absolute prick and I might go back to try this place but this will always be the first experience I tell people about of this place.> Dont believe what you hear on the phone when your told 25 min before arrival that there's 10-15 min wait. Came all the way from San Diego, UBERED down just to show up n be told they were at full capacity. We were then redirected to the bar just to be told at the bar that they were closed ( so unorganized ) we then sat in an area towards the back and were told "" I just wanna let you know that it's at least a 30 min wait but there's no promises"" ya ALLAH. Sorry Mohammed, I don't know if you runnin the joint for your babba habibi but you suck.> Came here with a Moroccan friend for his birthday dinner and while I liked it, he said it wasn't very authentic as it was focused on meats and what he likes most is the variety of vegetables that are usually offered. My fist time eating out of a tajine, which was still cool. The sprits list is huge, so come with a friend who knows what they're talking about (cough me cough) or don't be afraid to ask!","4, 1, 1, 1, 3"

I stopped by after the Godzilla ride.Our service was a little sub par but hard not have a great time with the beautiful weather. We had a delicious mushroom pizza which is great to share between 2, the angry orchard cider and Jack's Abby. I would definitely recommend this on a nice day.> My husband and I were famished after our morning travels by car, bus, airplane, bus and water taxi. We anted a simple Boston nite to eat. We saw the reef on our way to checking into the Marriott on the reef. The hostess was sweet and efficient. Although it was a sunny Sunday afternoon the restaurant was not over busy and there was plenty of staff to search the clients efficiently. Our waiter, Danny (I think) was way under par in all respects.  He ran to and fro, he was slow and did not take care of us in an acceptable manner.  He took our order and our wait was excessive for a sandwich and soup.  My soup came with chip. 3 of them. The soup was delicious!  And two were mostly holes as they were very thin. We never got water refills nor did he check on us.  I watched him to get his attention and saw that his spermatic activities were not advantageous to proper care of his customers.  Usually a training problem.  I went to him, requested the check and sat down. He brought the check, then we waited another 15 minutes before I went to get him again.  I talked to a manager. She apologized and said she would ""take care of me"" NEXT Time!  I think that THIS TIME would have been a better idea.  We were tired and wanted to get to our hotel.  End of story.> Be aware...EXTREMELY slow service!  Foods good but if you have no plans and not on any schedule or very hungry, then you will have no issues. Our family loved the location and overall vibe but the service was so so slow....it lowered our initial enthusiasm.  For example, two orders of New England Clam chowder and two glasses of Pinot  took 20 minutes and they weren't that busy.> Great little spot The manager Debra  is wonderful, very sweet and attentive.  Our drinks were cold and delicious. Did not try the food but they have a nice selection of food.> This place is the best! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 3 years, it's very special to us. It's the first place that he told me he loved me, that was 3 years ago. Fast forward 3 years, this is where he proposed to me:)I recommend Reef Bar for anyone looking for an quality cocktail, friendly service, and good vibes!","4, 1, 2, 2, 5"

Just call it in ahead of time.> I've been here a couple of times and both times I've enjoyed my meals.  It's a simple low-key neighborhood type of place.  But that really works to its advantage in my opinion.  Each time I visited there has been a relaxed, laid back, comfortable atmosphere that makes for a pleasant dining experience.  The wait staff is friendly, helpful and dutifully answered the few questions that I had.   The food is solid and the portions are very respectable for the price.  They have a few Greek beers to choose from as well as some other no so adventurous selections.  Each time I've ordered kebabs of some sort and been very satisfied.  I made sure to finish things off with a piece of baklava and it totally hit the spot.  This place doesn't disappoint and I'm sure I'll be back.> This is a solid Greek restaurant! I had a chicken gyro with fries and it was delicious. Even the pita itself was really good-- it was warm, thick and perhaps lightly fried. I loved the homemade fries and was really glad I opted for the combo!The restaurant is small and casual. The service was friendly. The drinks were reasonably priced and the house wine was decent. I don't have a lot to say except I would definitely go back!> Cozy and intimate place for dinner, with casual ambience and artsy environment. I like the warm and cozy feeling in this place, making me feel like being home. It's a little loud and crowded but very welcoming and hospitalizing. The kitchen ventilation is not very good so the whole dining hall is heated by the kitchen heat and a bit smell but I'm not complaining.The food is good. We had a lamb shank and a gyrio. The shank is cooked very well. The gyrio is not bad. Pretty healthful food and cooking style, I believe. It's a greek place, although I feel it's slightly leaving to middle eastern style. Anyways, delicious and nice for a casual dinner. Good price and serving size, too.> Came here for lunch. Nice spacious seating area. Service was friendly and quick. Order Greek salad with grilled chicken, spinach pie and sovoulniki plate. The salad was tasty and fresh. Spinach pie was fairly big portion and was ok. Came with some cold pita :( the plate came with two stick of meat, some salad and fries (which were a bit soggy). Overall food had good portion and was tasty although not best Greek food I had. Still would recommend.","5, 4, 4, 4, 4"

This is the first FAST (Food Ambience Service Trendsetter) review coming your way!Food: 5 I'm a sucker for arepas. We ordered the prenil arepa to start. The pork was so flavorful and tender, every bite was perfect with a great combination of pork and cheese. It's different from the street style arepa, the cheese wasn't melted and the breading on the outside is open. For our main entrees Asado Negro and Pabellon criollo. Both entrees were super good. The asado negro beef with au jus mixed perfectly with the white rice. Loved every bite!Ambience: 4 Great atmosphere, not too small but we sat in a cozy corner. The lighting is dim to set the mood! Service: 5I wish I could give the service more than 5 stars.. I was so shocked by how fast the food came and the waiter was very attentive even though he had a lot of tables to look after. Trendsetter: 4Pretty unique considering there's not much Latin food in Boston/Cambridge. I hope this place is around to stay!Final FAST Score: 5Overall great restaurant and highly recommend! Would definitely come back again> Since I moved to the United States I had a horrible experience trying to find the flavors of my beloved Venezuela. I tried a couple of restaurants in the West coast and I found disappoinment every single time. These restaurants would claim to be Venezuelan but their chef were not Venezuelans and the dishes didn't taste like our homemade food. However, yesterday I took my mother in law and my boyfriend (Americans) to enjoy the food of my country since we were walking around Harvard. I was worried at first but I am happy that I gave it a try! We ordered Tequeños, empanadas to start and then Asado negro, pabellón criollo and pollo adobo with tajadas. I also had a delicious agua de panela y limón that transported me for a second, to the Venezuela of my childhood, lost but not forgotten.> Orinoco is tucked away off of busy JFK street in Harvard Square. Its dining room has a warm, homey field to it, especially during the chilly Boston fall. We arrived just before 7 PM on a Friday and had to wait about 30 min to be seated. Once seated, the staff was friendly, and service was prompt. We started with a nice glass of Malbec and for my entree, I had the parilla caraquena (mixed grill). The mixed grill included a combination of Venezuelan chorizo, chicken, and steak served beside a heap of limey guacamole and a pile of yucca fries smothered in tangy Mojo. I've also had the beef empanadas from Orinoco, which were probably the best rendition I've had outside of Latin America. Compared to other spots in Harvard Square, I think Orinoco has a leg up for dinner in the $20 entree price range. Will return for another dinner or brunch!> I've been dying to try out this place since I first saw it in Brookling Village. I finally got to visit the Cambridge location instead and it was pretty awesome! I don't recall the actual menus (sorry!) but one of the two dishes we ordered was ""the most traditional Venezuelan"" entree and the other one was Pepito something. Both were very hearty, the waiter was super helpful, and the experience made me want to explore more Venezuelan cuisine. One thing I didn't love about the restaurant was that it was really cold (we were sitting near the kitchen and whenever the door opened, the wind seeped through). Overall, a very pleasant experience!> Delicious celebration of cheese and life! My colleague and I checked this place out and were not disappointed once. Have a whole meal of arepas, small plates, and empanadas! The mushroom flatbread is a meal in itself, but the arepas were stuffed with cheese ... and my god, I as 50 Cent once said, I loved them like a fat kid loves cake. I also asked for some hot sauce and a huge bottle was placed on the table. This stuff is no joke, and like Sex Panther in ""The Anchorman,"" ""smelled like pure gasoline."" But it was a delicious touch to everything.","5, 5, 5, 4, 4"

I honestly tried to look for your hours, but couldn't find it on the door. Ordered the Back Bay Maki, which had avocado, asparagus, inside a rice roll and topped with lobster. One of the rolls, was placed inside a lobster head, which looked better on the menu, but seemed pointless (in terms of presentation) in person. I liked the creamy sauce on the roll, but couldn't place my tongue on what it was. The Rundown:Ordered HOT SAKE, received ASAHI (only 2 left, so I opted for coke (was warm) and let my friends enjoy it instead). Urged us to order our rolls right away because the sushi bar was wrapping up, but took a bit too long to ask our orders (time is of utmost importance). All in all, I love the decor in the restaurant and really appreciate them being patient with us as the last guests of the night. I definitely want to come again and eat at our leisure.> Not bad for the price.. My favorite is the tri color don which comes with rice and miso soup. The gyu don was okay - could use more flavor. However it comes with  miso soup, a maki roll and 4 pieces of nigiri making the entree very filling. Due to the limited sushi options in back bay, this is a good option for a no frills, quick sushi dinner or lunch. Chose this place because of the seated app!> For lunch, a Gyu-Don Lunch Bento to go.Beef with Onion, Served with chef's choice of maki and appetizers, rice, miso soup, and house salad.The salad and miso soup were fine.  The beef tasty, but thin cut and a bit tough.  The portion of the main dish was better than first impressions with the two appetizers having been tucked into the same compartment.  The dumpling was a bit soft though it tasted better than the one I had at Fuji's on my last visit.  I liked the crumb crusted vegetable patty more though.For another lunch, another Bento, this time the Pan Seared Salmon Steak Lunch Bento, Teriyaki flavored.I read in another review how the fish was raw in the center, so I asked for mine to be cooked through, medium well.The first round, the maki were some kind of raw fish (I'm not really a raw fish gal), maybe tuna?  This time they were more my cup of tea - California Rolls.  Though a bit loosely wrappedThe fish was cut into two pieces and not particularly strongly flavored, however, I later discovered that their little compartment in the bento had some sauce at the bottom.  Dredging the fish in that upped the experience quite a bit.  The first piece was cooked through as requested.  The second was shiny smooth pink in the center, medium perhaps?The apps were again found in the same compartment as the protein, and the dumpling was greatly enhanced by its dip in the sauce pool.Between the two bentos thus far - my vote goes to the beef.Their Tiramisu dessert is a dainty portion but light and tasty.They also offer a white grape aloe drink in a can.> The service could be better. The sushi  was alright, I've had better. They do have these cool seats next to the window and those are perfect for people watching. It's a small location and decent variety of sushi. They are right on Newbury St. but I will be trying out a different restaurant next time I go to newbury st. The UMAI sushi roll is $14 and it comes with 8-9 pieces. The sushi roll was good/alright.> This is my first Yelp review ever, so listen up. The service was horrendous, management nonexistent, and the food was the worst TROLL sushi ever. Let me get into it right now. My order was completely wrong, or the waitress was wrong, or the sushi chef was wrong, or just wrong wrong wrong. I ordered Tamago Sweet Egg Sushi. Is that hard to understand? It came out sashimi, then they had to correct my order. Now I won't describe how it came out. You will have to check out the picture yourself. Trust me, it will be the cutest Tamago sushi ever. I guess they coming up with a new hybrid fusion of sashimi/nigiri called stuck in between, or maybe they just ran out of RICE.The sweet potato tempura was not sweet as all. The batter was bad. Just bad. I only ate one piece and the server took it back. No return of a new sweet potato tempura nor was it taken off the bill. Wow. What service!Ordered Umai Roll, didn't come out. Thank God!And now the highlight of the night, the infamous ""Baked Alaska Roll"" which costs $16, so a Premium Roll right? Wrong! Check the picture below! I ordered it without cream cheese only, but look at it, missing so many more things on it. At least drip the spicy mayo on it Bro to make it look like the picture.Manager verbatim ""the maki doesn't come out like the picture."" Ummmm, many if not all people order food based on the DESCRIPTION and PICTURE that your menu states. WTF?!!! I can't believe she said every sushi chef makes it their own way, not admitting they made a mistake, no intent of correcting or changing it for me, but rather argue with your customer when clearly what I ordered is not what I got. Mindblown! If I can give this place 0 stars, I would be the first in line. My first Yelp Review happens to be a Negative one. I will no longer eat there and promote others to stay away and not get tricked with this foolery. Or in my case, some TROLLing Sushi.","4, 3, 3, 3, 3"

Bartender was not friendly to me however seemed very involved with coworkers and regulars, and in fact never took any of my orders but participated in this weird thing where the manager took my order and she silently filled it. No biggie really I like the quiet.Weird #2. One dollar upcharge for fries with burgers and sandwiches. Dude it's a dollar! Either bump your prices by a buck or charge a couple bucks extra. Just weird.Weird #3. Nothing on tv except MNF pregame at 7:30 pm. I am the only one at the bar besides a couple at the end. There are 9 TVs at said bar. But, some genius turns 7 of the screens to celtics pregame and 2 to some college game.Weird #4. Dooley's pub across the street was packed on a Monday, with not even one seat at the bar, but this place was pretty much vacant when I was there. Should have been my clue.The food: weak menu. A lot of chicken. No beef tips as I saw online. I wound up getting the Reuben, which was very good, but would have been excellent if more meat, or at least they spread it out to the edges of the bread. Sweet potato fries were hot and crispy. Attractive menu.The beer: decent selection but super pricey. I had 2 ipas one was 10 dollars one was 9. Too many other choices nearby. Not a horrible experience, just nothing special and $40 for beer and a sandwich. Super disappointed in this place because it COULD have been great!> A colleague and I decided to check out Battery Park after arriving in Boston for business on a Thursday night.  We were looking for an easy, nearby sports bar with good food and cold beer, and it hit the spot.  Similar to New York, the Financial District in Boston seemed to clear out as the evening went on, but this establishment had a decent crowd for a Thursday night.  We split the Fried Pickles appetizer, and for my entree I went with the Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls.  Both were tasty, although I took a particular liking to the Egg Rolls, which is a pub dish I tend to relish when done right.  They came with six pieces and were served with a southwest ranch sauce as well as a spicy ketchup - gotta love it when a place doesn't skimp on dipping sauces!  The restaurant also has a couple dozen different beers to choose from, ranging from some unique craft beers to $3 draft Natural Light.  Additionally, there are TVs everywhere to watch whatever game(s) may be on.Battery Park Bar & Patio satisfied exactly what we were looking for.  I would definitely recommend to someone staying in the area.> Stumbled upon this hidden gem on my lunch break today! The back patio reminds me of New York patios with the string lights, exposed brick, and city vibe. Our server was phenomenal and gave us great recommendations for lunch as it was our first time. It was refreshing to have a server who you could tell enjoys their job! I got the taco salad and my friend got the shrimp tacos (on the recommendation of the server). Both dishes were great! The manager even came over to our table mid meal to check on us. :-)If you can't make it here for lunch you have to at least come for a drink on the patio. Literally a hidden gem in the heart of Boston. I'll be back soon!> Cute bar food snack vibes. Quesadilla had barely any cheese, and the philly steak egg rolls looked better than it tasted. The buffalo chicken Rangoon's were actually the best thing I've had in forever. I would go back just for that. Also the nachos looked amazing.","4, 3, 3, 4, 3"
Ristorante Euno,Boston,4,3,Yes,Null,No,eunorestaurant.com,"Italian, Mediterranean, Pasta Shops",5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 11:00 pm,5:00 pm - 10:00 pm,Null,Null,"Was delighted to a four course meal in the downstairs wine cellar at Ristorante Euno! This is definitely the way to dine at another fantastic North End Italian restaurant. My friend reserved the cellar for her birthday party of about 20 people. The staff and owner were more than accommodating and happy to host our large group (even though we got a little loud after a few heavy pours of wine!) The cellar is a perfect spot for a dinner event.Now for the food...First course: Assorted AntipastiThe staff brought around multiple apps for the tables with plenty of food for everyone to try. We had the deliciously crispy calamari fritti, a cheese and charcuterie plate, and my favorite -- the meatballs! They melted in your mouth. Second course: Pasta! 2 dishes to tryOkay truly this was my favorite course of the night. I could have ate an entire pot of the Gnocchi con Funghi. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in the North End -- just imagine tasting gorganzola, mushrooms and truffle oil in a cream sauce with potato pillows... drooling again just thinking about it. We also got the Rigatoni Fatti in Casa which is roasted eggplant over thicker noodles in a red sauce. It was also very tasty, but my mind was already set on getting as much gnocchi as possible on my plate.Third course: EntreeWe had a choice of 4 options for an individual entree. The sirloin steak (Bistecca Euno) was a popular option, but the waiter gave a glowing recommendation of the daily peppercrusted tuna special so I had to go with that. He was not wrong, it stood alone as a knockout dish. Served with rice and green beans, it was a filling dish cooked perfectly.Fourth course: Obviously dessert! We had an assortment of treats come out for dessert. The creme brûlée... just amazing. The cannoli was also delicious. Oh and the flourless chocolate cake, yummm. On top of that, several of us finished with an espresso martini. Great way to end the night! Throughout the whole dinner we constantly had staff checking on us and refilling our glasses. Keeping this place in mind for when I host a birthday dinner.> Fantastic host and atmosphere! Our meals were great. Monkfish special along with fettuccine, scallops and lobster. The calamari was great as well.We got to try a sample of the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and mushrooms and the gnocchi were delicious.Make sure to make a reservation!> O M Ggo here. Skip the other spots and go here!!! We had a group of 20 people, they seated us in their lovely basement and we had not only excellent service but also amazing food!!We tried all the appetizers including the specials- honestly you cannot go wrong.I personally also got the truffle gnocchi- dear god if I didn't have a flight at 4am the next day I seriously would have eaten the leftovers for breakfast it was so good.> I was tempted into this restaurant because someone told my company that this was the best restaurant in the north end... I might have to disagree. The menu is very small, but the pasta was very good. The fish came with 5 potato wedges, so portions were skimpy for $30 (well seasoned potato though, so more potato would have been great). They are understaffed. Getting a refill of water took a long time and required waving hands in the air. Bathrooms were kind of dirty.> I have a love hate relationship with the North End, which mostly consists of me loving all of the small mom and shop restaurants with delicious Italian food, but hating the long waits and failed attempts to eat at said restaurants. Anyways, enter Ristorante Euno, a cute North End spot that that takes reservations. Decided to check it out with a couple friends a while back and had a great time!We started with the Caprese Homemade and Carciofo Euno. The Caprese was yummy, though it's pretty much good everywhere. The grilled artichoke was surprisingly delicious, especially with the generous amount of goat cheese! And I certainly can't complain about how large they were and how tasty well they went with the prosciutto. Yum!!! I then had the pasta special of the night, a Seafood Squid Ink Pasta. It was really good! Generous amounts of seafood and well-cooked pasta. My only complaint was that it was a tad oily, but that didn't stop me from gobbling it down for dinner, and for lunch the next day. Service was warm and friendly. There's a more romantic feel at Euno than at other North End places, probably a combination of the dim lighting, exposed brick, and lack of people shouting. Will definitely come back to Euno when I want a nicer meal in the North End, or when I want to avoid those long lines that make me so grumpy!","4, 5, 4, 5, 3"

Really good. Fun place, good energy, a bit pricey and worth it. Years ago, my friend and I would go there and when they served you your coffee, they gave you a dish with the sugar options and included some chocolate disks to make your hot coffee mocha. Was so good! Never found another restaurant do this. If you find one tell me!I've had business lunches, celebratory lunches and more. I like it.> tl; dr: anywhere else. OMG, ANYWHERE ELSEWhen you'd rather go anywhere else in Boston, that's a one-star. ANYWHERE else.First couple of visits, I was wooed. I thought Les Zyg was dependable. All you have to do is see my earlier reviews. And then a friend from Philly said,  ""I'm coming to Boston -- South Station -- let's meet,"" and I thought of Les Zyg. I mean, why not? They're old school, they have happy hour specials, they have music....Who wouldn't want a Manhattan and a few oysters?But we got there and it was an unmitigated disaster. We ordered drink and food from the happy hour menu, stuff that, while on sale, sill adds up to a pricey meal. But from start to ... well, we never got to the finish -- from the get-go, it was sad, slow, disheveled,disinterested service. Any negative modifier that you can think of, that was Les Zyg. If you doubt believe me, just try them. They'll be glacially slow, bad --We order $70 worth of food and drink. What we got was -- to put it politely --- shitty -- and what we didn't get, we'd waited a VERY LONG TIME before it never showed. And we're taking food and drink in the after-work hours. Drinks aren't reduced-prices. It was so bad -- the Philly friend with obligations elsewhere -- that we finally said something, such as, you know, we're running out of time. And the manager? Who knows who is in charge here. Whomever she was, by the time we said something, she was, like, GO. That's how bad it was. She was, like, go.....How often does management wave you off a $70 tab? It was very bad.It was so so very bad that the restaurant itself was all, like, get out of here. For us, it was a disaster. We left there hungry and thirsty and dragged a suitcase all the way to Quincy Market for a reasonable bite to eat. And I thought, OMG, here's this place that I gave a bunch of stars, a full throated endorsement. Maybe it was an aberration?But I couldn't bring myself to try it again. I couldn't even update my review. And I purposed to never return, And I didn't.And then a bestie said, We're meeting at that place....What place, I asked. (I thought it was Trouque on South.)  I was, like, sure. See you there. I love Matt's Sazerac. But when she said it was Les Zyg, I was aghast..... But I thought, okay, maybe it's just me. Maybe that last visit was a mistake, a bad night....SO I showed up. They had a table in the bar, two very attractive ladies drinking cosmos. I joined them. And I swear, my god, it was probably 30 minutes of chatter with NO server. NONE. I'm frickin parched. This is a smallish place at happy hour -- not even full -- and NO server shows up to say ""what'll it be?""So i finally get up to ask the bartender. At which point, a server shows up. Meanwhile, my friends say, server is absent, you'd better know EXACTLY what you want if anyone shows up table-side. And because I don't trust them, I order a beer on draft and the oyster special. That's it. The beer comes quickly, the cocktails not as, but the oysters? 45 minutes? FORTY-FIVE FRICKEN MINUTES. Are they knee-deep in the water dredging the creatures?(One could hope.)Am I in MCI Framingham? (What an ugly ugly scene.)At Les Zygomates, service is non-existent. Food is ordinary. But, prices are very high, consistent with every other place in Boston and the vicinity. OMG, I can't wait until someone who knows how to run service buys this place out. The only way I'd ever return is if they're burying by mother and the drinks are free and self-service. And free. Even then, I'd bring a flask.> Very elegant setting. There's a room with a man playing piano and on the other side is more casual music so you can really pick your mood. The prices were a bit high but the cocktails were amazing. Would definitely come here for a date night.> We had a reservation for 8:30 but still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. It was a Friday night, but they weren't ridiculously crowded and the service was a bit slower than I expected. However, the live music was really nice and the overall ambiance was great. I had the sangria and it was just ok, but we split a bottle of champagne that was wonderful. The bread and butter was amazing - I believe they put honey in the butter. We got some clams and oysters to start, as well as the yellowfin tuna which I would definitely recommend. I ordered the duck and it was absolutely perfect! I would come back and have that again. To finish it all, we had the raspberry and lemon sorbet. It was a great way to end the meal.This place is lovely and the live music/food quality makes it worth checking out for sure.> I have been here once and thought my experience was just okay. There was nothing exceptional about it, except maybe its live music performance.I had the magret duck breast ($36), and I finished everything on my plate, it was so good! But... it is not really French cuisine, or is it? I don't know why I always have high expectations for excellent services at high-end places like this. My server was impatient and passive-aggressive. I don't think he was having a good day. So whatever. The table next to us sensed his attitude, and they tried to joke around with him (e.g., the server was like do you want to a refill of red wine, the patron responded with I'd like a refill of grape juice), and the server did not have it at all.Honestly, in my limited experience at high-end restaurants, I don't believe I've encountered anyone yet where I was like okay this person entirely deserves a 20% tip. In fact, it is always these family-run businesses where I'd feel welcomed and be willing to tip 20% wholeheartedly.The biggest let down was dessert. I had Molten Chocolate Cake for $9 (Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Melted Chocolate). First of all, I've had plenty of salted caramel ice cream, and I was like why do I get vanilla ice cream? Or was this like extra light caramel? And then where is the melted chocolate? I got like a piece of chocolate-flavored cupcake. Huh? Never again.","4, 1, 3, 4, 4"

I had no idea they were so popular. I made my pick-up order via Grubhub and applied their $7 off promo, resulting in my total charge being only $4.82 - I ordered Tarka Dal. It was accompanied with basmati rice and a side of red chutney (?) Not sure if I was supposed to receive complimentary naan with it or... I do feel as if that was the missing component to this.All in all, I was pleased with my meal. I haven't had Indian cuisine in many years; I'm glad it was this restaurant that I chose to order from. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I have to specifically request utensils to-go but I didn't receive any in my bag. I had to duck into Star Market to grab some. Not worth knocking a star off though.> Nom nom nom. First this was delicious, however door dash took TWO HOURS so I was hangry when I dug in and can't in good conscience give a five star with hangry eating. Keema Nan and Keema Pratha were standard good - 3 stars. Husband had Chicken Madras and consumed 75% of it and a vegetable samosa. He gave the chicken madras 3.5 stars because it exploded with flavor. The Samosa gets 4 stars from him due to flavor and the dough. I thought there was too much dough and meh flavor. Lamb Shahi Koorma was delicious. The sauce was as expected hot/spicy and creamy and perfect for a winter night. I liked all the flavors and spices, but I think they could have kicked it up a little, I'm always afraid to ask for more. There is a fine line between spicy and nuclear explosion spicy. The lamb was really what pushed this to a 4 star range. It was delightful. Not chewy, could cut it with my fork. And there was a lot of it. And it tasted like lamb, many times I find the flavor is lost in the spice. Not here!All in we will return. We won't ever DoorDash from there again (they did refund our order), but I blame the driver.> My friend and I stopped by to have lunch, the food was out of this world, staff was friendly . If I could give them 10 stars, I would. I love to cook, and I am very picky when it comes to eating out. Zabardast khana!!!!! Shukeria> We love the food at Punjab Palace! We had a great delivery experience through them using Grub Hub. Everything was excellent. We had onion bhaji, my favorite, coconut soup, saag paneer, lamb saag -love saag! Also chicken korma &naan. Ordered medium spice level, it was all wonderful. Oh, and the best sweet lassi, correctly made with a hint of rose water. We're stuffed!> I have heard that Cambridge has way better I dian food than Boston, but coming here proved this wrong! I have learned that Boston can do Indian food great too. The food  was authentic and in large portion sizes. The garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all really good. They also offer a curried onion dish as a freebie. I would recommend coming with friends so you're able to try an array of different dishes!! The space was also very calm and not crowded (came on a weekday for lunch). Very pleased with my experience and recommend this place for anyone craving a great, authentic Indian meal.","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

The first time I went with my friend and boyfriend for dinner. I had the burger and it was delicious. This past weekend I went for brunch and enjoyed the avocado toast. The ambiance is nice and we were able to find parking both times. Both times we got great bartenders. The service is really friendly and able to make menu suggestions. I do think their cocktails are a little too sugary sweet for me but overall I really enjoy the restaurant.> Decided to stop by Dryft having come across articles about its opening and great menu. We made reservations for a weekend and got seated at the exact time, not a minute more or less which was really something to note. The restaurant had a good ambience with some beaty music and a great view. The service was warm and friendly and we were given a few recommendations on asking. Our drinks were good and the bar menu has a decent selection to chose from. The 2 starters we opted for were: - The Mediterranean platter which could have been better but was tasty nevertheless - The Shrimp Kabob was a blast of flavours, although the quantity / portions ought to be more. We knocked the plate clean in just a few seconds - Our main course included the burger, chicken under a brick and gnocchi. We weren't taken away by these dishes, they were hearty however lacked the punch it needed. The gnocchi had an odd aftertaste, one that I haven't had before. Overall, the seafood here seems to be the better bet so explore those the next time you head here. The menu is a concise one at the moment and I do hope they add a few more options to the roster, dessert as well. Would definitely give Dryft another visit!> Great end of job dinner spot. This is where we finished our project end of job party. What a great place. Awesome staff ....from our waitress D ,she was amazing, to the food and drinks that came out.... 20 people and they never missed a beat. This place is a must try... all the dishes were excellent. Wish we would have found it sooner. #BuddhaReview> My hubby picked me up from the station from work and we were both hungry. He wanted some burgers but I wanted some fish dish. So as usual I yelped something around the area. I've seen this one before when it was hot and new but haven't had the chance to actually check out the place. We ended up agreeing on coming here. It was quiet that afternoon, we got sat pretty quick since there was literally like 3 people in the bar and that's it, no one was dining on the tables. We also got to choose where we wanna sit. We ordered and had some drinks. The food was good, it also came at a timely manner, service was alright. The manager was nice enough to give my husband another beer on the house since I think they know each other from way back. I got some pics of my food and I would go back next time when given the chance.> It's a new year and Dryft is bringing some style and your next date night to Revere. At the wonderland t stop, it's wonderfully convenient to get to. The place is a bit small but it looks like they'll have a patio for the summer months so lookout brunch Sundays!I came here a few times. I got the lobster fra diavolo and the bolonese the second. Both were very good and as they find their stride I only expect it to get better. Dessert is rotating but the night I got the lemon cake , it was sublime. The cocktails aren't too shabby either.","5, 4, 5, 4, 5"

The yellowtail was good but I was left craving my favorite.> After coming back here for lunch a couple times, I think my rating veers closer to a 3. The tori no karaage is breaded well enough though it's more flaky than crispy. The chirashi bowl was definitely instaworthy but the content (fish and tamago) were not particularly strong. The tamago was vaguely sweet but it didn't leave much of a strong impression. The seafood (tuna, salmon, shrimp, whatever else I can't remember) was decently fresh but reminded me more of fish from AYCE sushi. Finally, the amount of rice given was maybe a bit too generous since I finished maybe three quarters to three fifths of the rice before calling a day. Not my first choice for sushi by any stretch but definitely enough for a quick craving if I really need to satisfy my cravings.IG: Mood4foodeatery> My second meal at Fin's just a short walk away from the Boylston T stop was the better of the two.Service was a bit overeager, with her taking away the chopstick wrapper that I had folded into a tent to set my chopsticks upon, and the clean napkin which I had moved off the appetizer plate.Their menu is new, and the Chilean seabass I had my eye on was no longer on it.  Instead, I ordered their Pork Belly Bun $7 appetizer and the Beef Don $15 House Entree that is served with miso soup.  The soup arrived hot, with a generous scatter of tiny diced tofu.  The pair of steamed buns were filled with two slices of pork belly apiece.  Though not quite melty, the belly meat was still quite good.  The rice bowl with beef and onion was a good portion, though the vegetables being but sliced raw cucumber and some of those yellow pickled daikon was a bit light.  The meat was cut thin and well done, so it was a bit tough as well.  However, the well flavored soft sliced onions more than made up for it, and the sauce melded with the rice as well.Another table near by ordered the salmon and soybean fried rice, and it looked pretty good and was portioned as an entree.4 stars.***There was a wait at Fin's Sushi & Grill on a Friday evening, reminding me that they are located a short walk from the T by the Theater District.  So I opted to get my meal to go.I wanted noodles, so I got the Yaki Noodles with Beef $12 (with Udon!).  The wait was short - just over 10 min.  The noodles hot and slippery soft tender, the veggies (mostly onions, sweet cabbage, bok choy, green and red bell peppers) crisp, the beef though, cut into short strips, were super well done and dry.  2 star dish.On another visit I gave the Udon Yaki Noodles another chance with Seafood for $14.  The seafood was shrimp, scallop, and calamari.  The shrimp were tail on and overcooked.  The scallop were thin pieces and overcooked.  The calamari were rounds and rubbery.  Sense a theme?  Even some of the vegetables mixed with the noodles were overcooked on this go around.  2 stars.Averaging to 3 stars.Since my orders were to go, I didn't have the chance to comment on my dinners to the staff.Perhaps I'll give their sushi a go?Fin's Special Roll $7 shrimp tempura, peach, cucumber, mayo, bean sprouts, with eels sauce on topUna-Avo $7Grilled Vegetable Roll $5Scorpion Maki $10 grilled eel, cucumber, avocado and tobiko wrapped with shrimp and eel sauceSpider Maki $10 deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, with masago, spicy mayo, and eel sauceRock 'N' Roll $7 fish tempura, cucumber, spicy mayo & eel sauceGrilled salmon Roll $7 grilled salmon with cucumber, scallions, and eel sauceVegetable Poke Bowl $15 with sushi rice or field green salad,  Avocado, mango, Japanese bean sprouts, strawberry, scallions, seaweed, red onion, sesame seeds, mixed with Japanese dressingOther thoughts:A combo appetizer meal of Beef Dumpling Soup $5 and Avocado Salad $6Chashu Miso Ramen in Soup $15Unagi Fried Rice $11Pork Katsu with curry sauce $16***Starter: Agadashi Tofu $5Entree: Grilled Eel Ramen $15The crisp shell of the tofu sogged up quickly in the sweet sauce, so eat it quick.  But the portion was an acceptable count of 6 cubes.The ramen was okay, but bean sprouts took over the bowl and the toppings were mild.  The eel, 5 thin slices, wasn't quite satisfying enough, and too soft to provide any contrast with the soupy noodles in terms of texture.  Perhaps I ought to have tried the duck instead?3 stars.***Okay, I had a chat with the staff.  They tend to overcook their beef because their clientele prefers the beef fully cooked, so just ask for it to be prepared ""medium.""  I'll have to give that a try sometime.I'll allow a 4 star average on this set till I test it out.> I have mixed feelings about this place!  I come here mostly for the Yaki Ramen with chicken! Best Japanese stir fried noodle in town!! I discovered this when I worked at Massachusetts General Hospital at their Beacon st location and was very excited when they opened up in Chinatown. Taking off one star for charging $1 for a drop of hot sauce!! FYI: if you want hot sauce (sriracha) to dip in on the side, they will charge you $1. When I asked the waitress she said at the other table someone asked for  mayonnaise sauce and that is $2. I think this is too much since you can get the whole bottle for $3 and we just want a little bit to make our food spicy!! There is no cooking or prepping needed to the sriracha> I've always passed this location and didn't really think much of it until my friend wanted to eat here. I must say, this place exceeded my expectations! The fish for the sushi and donbori was very fresh and the portion cut were well worth the price. The ramen was where i had to deduct points. The broth was very... generic. It tasted similar to the powdered broth you get with packaged ramen. Not that it wasn't tasty, but it wasn't anything special. In general, stick to sushi!","4, 3, 4, 4, 3"

The food is so good I don't care. They need to open a location in Hyde Park. 5 stars> Yummy food, excellent value, and speedy eats. Ordered delivery via DoorDash and it was at my door within 25 minutes despite an estimated time of 40 minutes. We ordered the rotisserie chicken plate with two sides  (rice with peas, fried green bananas) and the fried pork plate with two sides (cassava and sweet plantains). The chicken was great -- the breast was a little dry but the drumstick was fall off the bone and the skin was tasty and well-seasoned. I found the fried green bananas a little tasteless but the rice with peas was good, savory and fragrant. The fried pork wasn't exactly fried and it was a little dry to boot, but the sweet plantain was over the top delicious.Overall for $30, you get enough food to last 2 meals per entree, easily. Fun place for takeout! I'm no expert on Dominican food but I enjoyed my meal!> Ordered delivery from here and I'm angry at myself for not discovering this place sooner. I tried the fried pork (carne sabrosura) combo with green plantains and cassava, and the fried chicken (capitaleño) combo with sweet plantains and fried rice (chofan). The prices were a bit higher than what is on their website ($13.50 each rather than $11.50 on the website) but this may be because I ordered delivery.The meat was on the dry side but the portions were huge! Despite the meat being dry, it was super flavorful. The sides were also very tasty. I think the fried rice is a good deal because they give so much and the rice itself has pieces of meat in it, so somebody could definitely eat it alone as a meal.Their other meat options sound awesome (chicharrones or rotisserie chicken) and I hope to try their other sides soon.> What a gem! I stopped by for a late night dinner and honestly wasn't expecting much. But it's great food, quick, and super cheap. I haven't had Dominican food before, and this left a really good impression. We got the medium combo sabrosura for dinner (and wasn't able to finish) as well as a passion fruit milk. First, the passion fruit drink is super refreshing and tasty. It's better than all the passion fruit drinks I've had at any boba shop. The combo was also good; we got the rice with peas and fried plantains as sides. I loved everything, except the plantains. They were a little dry and flavorless. In terms of ambiance, there really isn't any. Very hole in the wall restaurant with limited seating. It's best for a grab and go meal. Other than this, I tried a new place and will probably have cravings for their food soon.> Small place but yummy food. A good place to pick up a quick meal. Street parking. Menu is also in English for those who don't understand espanol like me. But just point point point, and boom.","5, 4, 4, 5, 4"

All of their staff is super nice. Although it gets busy at lunchtime, they have their prep down to a science. I've never needed to wait for more than 10 minutes.  My go-to's are the BLT and the turkey club on white (turkey club comes with fries!). Portions are very generous, and their sandwich lettuce is excellent.Overall, if you're north of DTX near the state house and looking for somewhere casual and delicious for lunch, this is the place for you.> Go here for breakfast at least once a week. The staff is very nice and everyone is cheerful. The prices are cheaper but you can definitely find the same thing cheaper around the corner. The quality of the food is good, you won't get it smothered in oil or butter, it will be just right. Havent had a dish here that i havent liked. The haddock, the breakfast, and the salmon are my favorites. The chicken wing special is good too! Oooo and the pesto chicken! Go here- tell them i sent you :)> First time visit from out of town. Was pleasantly surprised that a basic roasted turkey deli sandwich was actually delicious! Every bite, even the pickles and greens in the sandwich were flavorful. Nicely done! If I lived in The Boston area I'd be regular.> My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast on our first morning in Boston. It was located directly across from our Airbnb, so naturally we had to try it out. There was quite a line signaling to me that their food had to be good. There are plenty of tables inside where you can enjoy your food, or many of the people I saw come through ordered theirs to go. We decided to eat in. I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a toasted everything bagel. My boyfriend got the ham, egg, and cheese on a toasted plain bagel. HOLY COW! They were both delicious. Boston bagels are truly to die for. I don't know what it is, but they taste so different from ours back home. We each also had a cup of their freshly brewed coffee, and enjoyed it. I can be picky when it comes to coffee, but theirs passed the test. It was a perfect temperature to walk around the city streets of a chilly Boston morning. Overall, great little deli spot. Breakfast was fantastic, so I can only imagine their lunch is good too! I did notice that they're only open for breakfast and lunch, so make sure you stop by early enough to try it out.> This place is amazing!!!! I am reluctant to write this because if more people come then there will be less for me, but a last the breakfast croissant with egg and cheese is the most amazing sandwich on the planet.  In addition their Salmon special is wonderfully prepared.  While I don't eat chicken I know that my coworkers go crazy for it.  They also make a great tuna sandwich. Aside from the food, the staff are truly pleasant and that's the best part of high spot!","5, 4, 5, 5, 5"

Bring a friend here who thinks she / he isn't a seafood fan and I promise they will be swayed. However, there are land options as well for the hard-headed non-seafood lovers such as Maine lamb shoulder. The chopped tuna crudo was a combination of curried chickpeas and typical tuna crudo - delicious! People rave about Frank Pepe's white clam pizza but if you haven't had that yet, come here instead and taste the best chopped clam pizza you've ever had. I'll definitely be back.> Came here just for the cocktails. Compared to other locations, their drinks are pretty mediocre. My husband and I ordered a total of 5, and I only really liked one of them - Sangre y arena Atmosphere at the bar was okay- it felt very tight and overcrowded.I would recommend sitting for dinner and not coming for just the bar. I am not a huge oyster fan but the people near us ordered them and loved it! Also the French fries looked and smelled fantastic!> Great date spot - nice lighting, good service and fun cocktails. That said it just isnt as good as Alden and harrow and as many reviews said the prices are barely justify the steep prices.We had the artichoke, smoked mackeral, whit pizza and fish sticks. The smoked mackerel was the best dish. The smokiness of the fish complimented the creaminess of the sauce. Almost an umami experience.The artichoke was solid. White fish pizza was a total miss - as many said it is too salty. The crust was yummy - great everything bagel flavor.Fish sticks were also salty. Perfectly fried but nothing special.> The food at Waypoint was solid and I'd definitely come back again. Let's get the petty stuff out the way first, our server looked angry the entire night. Dropped stuff off and walked away without us ever getting the opportunity to ask what each dish was or if we needed anything else...For the apps, the lobster toast was fine but the menu fails to mention the copious amount of celery that hits your face when you take a bite. Crab fries were phenomenal and one of my favorite dishes of the night, so well seasoned along with the chili mayo dipping sauce.We got 2 pastas (lobster cacio e pepe and uni bucatini) and they were both pretty bad. Dry, under seasoned, and cold. These dishes nearly ruined the meal for us, just avoid their pasta dishes altogether.For entrees we got the chopped clam pizza. First time having something like that took a few bites to acclimate but overall I enjoyed it. Had a nice kick and flavorful. We also steak tartare, char belly, and lobster tails. Lobster tails were really tasty and my favorite dish of the night. The belly was bland and had bones in it so pass.Bonus points for having a good mocktail menu. Overall it was good but some misses in between.> Came here for a Valentine's Day dinner celebration and was so happy to have found this place! The staff were very kind and friendly. I had requested for a booth and they were able to provide me with a booth table (thank you!). We ordered the crab fries as an appetizer which was a must get!! We then got the clam pizza which was out of this world delicious! Another must get. The salmon crudo was nice and refreshing, but can be omitted. We then got the caramel dessert which was a flan-like dessert. It had hints blackberries and was a nice refreshing end to our dinner. I would definitely recommend !","5, 3, 3, 4, 5"

We went around 7:30 PM on a Friday night expecting a wait but were lucky to get seated immediately (the place was still pretty busy).This place is casual sit-down with a takeout option. The rotating pillars of gyro meat in the kitchen make it seem like one of those gyros places but then the front of the house is a casual sit-down dining area. We were dining in and were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service, both the polite and attentive waitress and the speed at which the food came.FOOD: We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip to share and then I had the Lamb Chili and the Original Pork Gyro for dinner. I would recommend all 3 dishes and wish I could have gotten more (but I was full!). The Spinach and Artichoke dip was very tasty and came with this delicious warm pita that I started eating alone once we ran out of the dip (my only wish is that there was more dip!). The Lamb Chili was perfectly spiced and warming on a cold evening in December. Lastly, the Gyros is very large and stuffed with veggies and tzatziki, in addition to tons of pork. Perhaps the best thing we had was the side of fries. They were thick-cut but crispy on the outside but warm and potatoey on the inside. Perfect fries!Next time we come back, I would like to try the Meze!> There aren't a lot of good Greek places north of Boston where you can get a fresh Gyro. At $14, with a side, it's a good deal. Lots of meat, very fresh & tasty. It's on the outskirts of Assembly Row, but worth a stop if you're craving something a bit different. Grab it to go, or sit at one of their hight tops.> My favorite Greek spot in Boston. The gyros are delicious and made with great pita and fresh ingredients. I always ask for hot sauce on the side to spice things up. Their roasted red pepper dip is like crack. Get it. Also the Greek fries are so good. You'll definitely leave here full as the portions are great. Everything is quality here and I highly recommend> I absolutely love this place. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean/Greek cuisine so I was happy that this place opened near my workplace. I come here for lunch at least once a week, and I'm obsessed with the Greek salad with chicken. The veggies are always fresh and crunchy, the chicken is always juicy and flavorful, and they have these carbonated lemonade drinks that have enough tang to satisfy you. The baklava isn't bad either.The service is fantastic as well, everyone is super friendly, and there are a few tables, along with some high top seating.> Arrived on a Sunday evening with a friend, excited to try a new Greek place. We were seated immediately and our waiter was consistently attentive to us during our meal. While there were plenty of appetizer and main course options on the menu, we chose the Mediterranean salad ($11), Original Gyro ($14, comes with pork and fries), and Beef Kalamaki skewers ($15). First off, this place has some cute interior designing that I'd imagine is reminiscent of Greece. I remember we were seated by a nice painting. Food came out relatively quickly and served hot. I wouldn't say there was anything special about the salad, but the way the meat is cooked here is different and tasty! Hope to visit another time and try some of their other offerings!","5, 4, 5, 5, 4"

The English muffin was so soft that I'm craving it right now. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Boston. Next time I will be ordering the dish my husband ordered which is French toast and chicken. That dish came with whip cream on the side and omg it was sooooooo good.> Stopped in for Sunday brunch to celebrate my friend's half marathon finish. The restaurant was full, but not packed and our server was great! They have an extensive cocktail list with some really fun options--even one with gummy sharks--but I opted for one of their many beers on tap. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict, one of many Benedict's they offer on the menu. My dish was pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular. We did have to wait an hour for the food and our server informed us that the kitchen staff was short one person so everything was backed up. He was kind enough to comp our meal given that we waited so long and so patiently, which we thoroughly appreciated.> Made my 2 year old daughter cry.  Shocking experience where the waiter mean, rude and unapologetic in aggressively and abruptly taking way simple sugar packets she was happily playing with.  I called the GM over to explain and she has but a few words to say, none of which were an apology. This is not the first time we had a similar experience to the first of this extreme. I hope this review serves as a wake up call for Brownstone.> 2 stars for the food and zip for service. Took over an hour to get brunch and a coffee, when we finally got the check (didn't look at it at first) and paid the bill came back at $50 for 2 coffees and 2 egg plates, the receipt itself was not included.After getting someone's attention they said the manager would be right on it, 10 minutes and a few apologies later the hostess drops off a correct check with no service recovery, visit from the manager, etc.Had to leave and run back to work after the extra-long lunch so didn't get to confront the manager about the lack of concern about overcharging people who might not pay more attention to what they're paying for but this is the kind of thing that'll make me never go to a place again. Trust matters.> We've visited the restaurant for brunch on a Sunday at noon and had a good number of tables available. This restaurant is located in the heart of Boston in Backbay and is conveniently close to Copley Place and Prudential. PROS:- Good selection of brunch choices at a very decent price (average at $10-$14 a dish) - Historic ambiance with window seatings that open up. - Food was delish - the avocado toast was perfect and the french toast with the blueberry compote was great. - Full drink menu to choose from (mimosas, coffees, beers, etc) CONS:- Parking is tough if you're driving to dine here and they do not offer parking validation.- Service was a bit slow as the waitstaff only refilled water once when we are already done with our meal and was ready for the check.Overall, I would have to rate this place a 3.5/5.","5, 3, 1, 2, 3"

It was a really amazing blend of flavors. Overall I really want to come back here on a night out!! The atmosphere was really cool and i loved all the old fashioned dive bar games.> Eh. EH. EHHH. Epic fail State Park. Yes, the vibes and location are spot on but the whole experience last night fell SO short I will not recommend this place to anyone.My man and I came in for the dollar oyster special they offer for Monday nights (10-12am) and were highly disappointed by what went down. There was one bartender on with what seemed to be an aloof female barback. Working in the industry, it really makes me cringe writing this but I still have those ODD vibes a day later. This is DEFINITLY an industry spot, yet, we don't work in Cambridge so we weren't down with the ordinary crew.We sat at the bar and the bartender checked my ID, then asked if he checked my ID shortly after. Um....yes you checked my ID. Are we in the twilight zone, or are you in the twilight zone? We then ordered 12 oysters, and when they came out they were served PLAIN. No cocktail sauce, no horseradish, no oil, and a flimsy wedge of slimey lemon. YUM?We then asked the female barback if they had any condiments for the oysters, she literally looked at us like we were aliens visiting earth and said no and walked away. Odd that on the regular menu the oysters say they are served with condiments. We wouldn't even care if we had to pay more but just a straight out no is kinda offsetting. Okay cool.We then didn't have any interaction with either of them for the rest of the experience. The bartender had all of his boys slugging those high lifes when he was ignoring guests at the bar. There was a couple next to us that was literally standing waving to get the check. Not really sure if the staff was feeling toasty themselves, which is why they felt the need to literally ignore us the ENTIRE time.Just when you think it can't get any worse, yes, there is icing on the cake. After waiving the barback down she says she can't run credit cards so be  prepared to wait longer, just fair warning. EXACT WORDING.Honestly, at this point we should of just walked out. What kind of place is this? I'm confused.Was really expecting a better experience. Boo State Park.> Arguably the best bar ever. Dark. Mountains. People are amazing. Food rivals anyone.

M and I really enjoyed eating here and will be returning for sure! I got the American wagyu shoyu ramen and it was really delicious. Not too salty. The meat was so tender! I also got the egg for $2 extra and I think it was worth it. It was perfectly cooked and so flavorful! (Cooked in soy sauce I think)M got the tan tan noodles and he liked it.

(M ended up picking up salmon sashimi from the grocery store and ate it at home after .)There's also ample seating and we look forward to bringing a group of friends here!> I don't recommend their ramen; the broth can be considered ""refreshingly light"" but I honestly thought it was bland. Noodle texture was also questionable for thing noodles.Otherwise, I liked the Aburasoba. I recommend that to those who like it.3/5> I came here when it just opened. The menu was pretty concise and most of the base was beef broth. They have specials on their menu too. When I was there, they were serving short rib ramen. Miso Ramen: I think it's pretty good. Portion is on the smaller side so might not be enough for some people. The broth was creamy and has the perfect amount of flavor. Noodles are great. The slices of Wagyu beef on top was tender. Overall I loved it! 5/5 Service/Space: This is located in the Maruichi food market. There were only two people working in the station. It's a kind of self-serving situation. I was surprised by how fast they served our ramen despite having to take orders and cook at the same time. The service was also great. They made sure our ramen was nicely presented too. There are plenty of seats in the food market! 5/5Parking/Transportation: This is located in Coolidge Corner, 5min walking from the Coolidge corner T stop. There are metered parking around.

At 15/bowl it was worth it for the yummy broth, choice of noodle and flavorful toppings (bamboo, corn, soft boiled egg, nori).My tan-tan men came with ground beef but others such as the shoyu and miso have American wagyu. My bf got the chashu ramen which had a flavorful sesame-y broth but the pork was a bit dry as it was missing the fat cap. The service was fast as we were served within 10 minutes. It's located within the old Gen Sou En building that's now a Japanese grocery store. We ate and then roamed and bought Japanese snacks which were surprisingly inexpensive. Japanese snacks (pocky, hi-chew, rice crackers, etc) I found we're cheaper than C-Mart.> We went to this new restaurant located in Maruichi market.They have ramen and Okonomiyaki We tried Aburasoba and Okonomiyaki.Aburasoba(no broth ramen with toppings and Pork rib&)It was very flavorful and noodle was chewy Okonomiyaki ( savory pancake with cabbage and egg )It was really like the one we had in Japan.We liked both and need to come back to try other things too.","5, 3, 5, 4, 5"

When I tell you that cheese does something different trust me when I say it. I went back a short few hours later and got another one. They have an ice cream shop attached. But I am not a fan of the texture on their Richie's Slush. Seems like its a lil over frozen. I love how friendly everyone is here and the food is amazing> Chicken patties are the best in the city. Aside from the occasional mix up where they will give me a beef patty instead for the curry chicken (even though they are marked off for distinction). (Confuses face?)> I was waiting for my friends to come over for dinner and needed a quick snack, so I walked over. If you go there close to closing time, be aware that they may not have a full menu. I got their fish sandwich and a vegetable patty. The such sandwich was . I was really grateful that they had so many options for vegetarians. Fish, soy, vegetable patties, etc. They make their own hot sauce and that is dope--isn't was delicious! BUT they charge 50 cents per container, that sucks because the container is so small.> I ordered an meal for pick during my lunch hour at work, and it was ready to go in the time period they mentioned so this was great. I ordered the jerk chicken which I thought had a more dense gravy like sauce to it than I would have liked which created a different taste in the chicken, but the rice and peas that went with it were decent, the cole slaw the meal came with was ok, and the beef patty was also ok, it tasted like the premade beef patties you buy at the grocery store so it was fine. However, the 2 employees that were there were very polite and friendly so I would like to potentially give it another chance.","4, 4, 2, 4, 4"

I would strongly recommend ordering in advance on the Bon Me website.> Slowly STEALING from their customers!I come here from work almost once a week for over a year. They use to give you good portions but now they started scamming their customers by skimming on the sizes. They switched from the large circle flat bowls  to these new stocky ones and now every time I go back they are filling the bowls less and less but raising the prices on you. The chicken udon soup use to be 11 something, now it's $13 something WITH HALF THR BOW FILLED! This disrespect won't be tolerated. Do NOT come here> My go to meal is the K-town throwdown. I prefer to order in store cause I find that they process in store orders more quickly (which is a plus) but there is also online ordering which is great if you time it correctly. The ingredients are always fresh. The flavors all go well together. Never knew I enjoyed boiled eggs with my food so much. One day I will venture out and try one of the sandwiches.

We came here late on a Friday night, right before closing and got a buffalo chicken pizza. Pretty good pizza but can't say it's as good as Il Mondo's.

It was not very crowded and we went at lunch time. It's small but had plenty of clean tables. The girl at the counter was very nice  and put in our order quickly. We got our food relatively fast and it was very good -nice and spicy too! I got the chicken curry with basmati rice. It was mostly sauce with five pieces of chicken, but with the rice mixed it it was enough to fill me up. I would go here again for a quick bite to eat.> The food is fine but they are pretty slow.So never ever visit that place if you don't have enough time.I had to wait for 30 min to get what I ordered at this place.The place to sit has 5 tables and they are busy serving the orders that they get from online.Wouldnt really recommend this place.> Not bad. Got delivery from here. It's priced a little bit lower another Indian places and they definitely have a lower delivery minimum.  The food itself tasted good, though a bit different from all other Indian places.  For example: the naan had a different consistency and didn't have the soft and flakey texture of most naan. Perhaps prepackaged. Also, the aloo ghobi was in a tomato sauce versus a light oil and tomato base. And they didn't send onion chutney which I'm used to getting with my meal.But still tasty and I'd order again.> This is my go to Indian cuisine in Boston!

It's sort of like a craft beer gastropub meets dive bar- and I mean that in the best way possible. It's a small place with maybe 6 tables and a decent sized bar. There are also three huge TVs which had two football games on while we were there. The draft list is extensive and has a ton of local offerings. Most of the list is from MA, NH, CT, and NY which is nice to see. They also have a huge selection of burgers. I tried the Ladder 21 burger which was served with cheese, lettuce, chipotle aioli, and fried jalapeños. Nice and spicy without being overwhelming. Sides are a la carte, with fries costing an extra $2. The fries were great. My husband tried the onion straws and those were really good too! Renegade's is a great place to grab a quick burger- we'll be back for sure.> Great little bar in E. Boston/Winthrop!!  We drive by here all the time and always talk about stopping in. We finally did and I loved it. They didn't have a huge tap list, maybe 12 beers, bu it was solid and offered a good variety. They also have a good bourbon selection. Our bartender, Hannah, was really friendly and knowledge. She knew her beers and bourbons. She provided several good recommendations. The food looked really good. My friend ordered the pork cracklins and loved them. They come out hot and still popping. I can't wait to go back. If I could give 4.5 I would.*************************************I really liked this place as you can tell from my initial review. I wish there was a way to post a second review instead of just updating. Anyway....I had a chance to come back and was excited. I tried to order a Bulleit Bourbon and was told they don't carry it. I asked for a list and was told that they rotate their bourbons and therefore don't have a list. Funny!  They also rotate their beers and have a list on the wall. I explained that I couldn't really read the bottles. The print isn't that big and so I think that's reasonable. The bartender didn't offer to make any recommendations so I just went with Makers. For my next drink I tried to order a double and she simply respond, ""Single"".  OK then!!I'm hanging out and all of a sudden the bartender cranks up the music. The place is small and all the table and seats at the bar were full. The music could be heard just fine even over the buzz of the people. I'm not sure why you would turn up the music. What's funny about this move is that the couple next to me at the bar had ordered a salad and a chicken sandwich. They were delivered a salad and two chicken sandwiches. They were right in front of the bartender and she didn't get it right and this was before she turned up the music. As you would expect nobody could hear each other because of the music so everyone is talking louder aka yelling. I know they have good burgers. I ordered the Ladder 21. A burger with chipotle aoli, fried jalapeños, pepper jack, avocado, and Cajun seasoning with a side of onion rings. I love onion rings. I was looking forward to them. Guess what?  She didn't hear me apparently and I got fries instead. I was let down. Turn down the music!!  The bartender comes back about a minute later and asks how my burger is. I clearly hadn't taken a bite and she clearly didn't care because as soon as the question left her mouth she started talking to the people behind me. It really goes to show the difference a good bartender makes and I think the reviews from my two visits show that. This bartender, Katie, I believe, couldn't care less, especially if you weren't a regular. This visit was on 1/10/2020. I'll come back, but if I see this bartender and it's busy I'll likely leave.P.S.  Then there's a twist. The bartender never took my card and didn't know what I ordered. I had to recap my night for her and for some reason she decided to comp a drink. It's a nice gesture yet unwarranted. Should it impact my review?  That's your call.> ive never in my life been so embarrassed in my life and I'm in going to continue coming to this bar just to make this bartenders life miserable. i came here at 12:30 my friend and boyfriend were drinking here literally an hour before and she thought she left her bag there at the bar and we went back to check. im going to be completely honest we were those people that walked into a bar and went into a bathroom both of us because we are girls and thats what we do. the drunk blonde bartender with her hair down decides to pound on the door and as i am peeing she breaks the door open and says ""one person in the bathroom"" and walks away... mind you i am mid pee. i then leave the bathroom to let the other person pee since she was so mad and every person at the bar turns and looks around to me and the bartender continues to talk about the situation to every guest and not even have the nerve to come up to me and speak to me to tell me i was wrong. while she is looking bad speaking nonsense to her customers she takes a shot behind the bar and looks right at me and laughs. shes clearly drunk managing this entire restaurant. renegades what a good look this is. a drunk bartender yelling at women who just spent money at your bar. i literally live down the street and come to this bar on the regular. thanks for the embarrassment! ill make sure to let everyone know to avoid the drunk blonde bartender.> The food and atmosphere is good but I am a localin the area and every time I come here I get poor service and rude staff. I will never recommend this place to anyone and I will never go there again.> I like what they're doing here and I'm amazed at the transformation of this place from when I used to live in Eastie and it was Jimmy Mags and then the Victory pub.

For what it's worth, this Shake Shack is a fairly new location that opened up a couple of months ago so I am not sure if they figured out how to use their personnel effectively for workflow. Either way, there are kiosks for people using credit cards and then the register for pretty much everyone else who has cash. Online orders wait right by the soda fountain. I was readily willing to burn my Shake Shack online order promo after a long day dealing with health insurance shenanigans at work. I placed my order online with a projected pick up time of about 3:45 or so (?) and got there around that time. I think I got my order of two shack burgers and fries around 4 or so. It was difficult to discern whether or not this was because other people like me were doing online orders and caused a backlog or whatnot. Either way, the burgers were steaming hot and the fries were crispy and salted just the right amount, matching the standards set by the rest of the Shake Shacks. I think they are probably still trying to figure out the best way to use their personnel to maximize speed/efficiency so I will cut some slack. Still coming back for a shack burger at some point.IG: Mood4foodeatery> This place is the epitome of chaos, disorganization, and inefficiency- causing long wait times despite all orders are through automatic kiosks (the machines are seamless and great. Humans are the problem). After 15 min wait with sparse customers in line, I got my order. They managed to get it wrong and had to remake the order. Another 15 min wait- for a burger. I'm able to write this review and edit while I wait, gives you an idea how long it is gonna be if you come here.During the long wait I saw staff standing around staring at the ceiling, another moving plates from one side of the kitchen to another, only to move them back again few minutes later- pretend busywork, clearly lacking in direction or any motivation whatsoever. I was standing in front of the ceiling gazer, eagerly waiting for my food, not a single question... the apathy and indifference is pretty astounding... Why would you need robot kiosks if you hire all these people to stand around doing nothing in the first place?Serious lack of management/supervision for something as simple as running a fast food chain. Will never bother with this hole again. Go to the McD across the street.> Very nice location conveniently on Washington street. Very lofty and a great seating area. Food is the same as you would find any other shake shack. My only concern is homeless people come in and bother the clientele for money. They really need security here.> Awesome new shake shack location in downtown Boston! Perfect place to grab a quick lunch on the go or grab a seat and hang out for a bit. There's a few booths, tables, and window seating. I came here with a group of friends on opening day and received a special Boston shake shack t-shirt! The staff was very welcoming and just like many of their other locations you can either order at the counter or on one of their iPads if you're paying with credit. I ordered on the iPad and they send you a text when you're order is ready. Super quick service, only 6 mins to get my shack stack, chicken stack, and fries! The shack stack is my favorite go to burger since it has the meat and the cheesy shroom. The fries were crispy and had enough salt, so it makes a perfect addition to your meal! If you're craving a burger, this is definitely a spot to check out!> Been to shake shack MANY times, came into this one for a burger and fries. Got my shack sauce on the side and didn't receive it. Also ordered fries and got about 15 fries, so not worth my money. Never coming back to this location, extremely poorly run. The burger was okay, I've had way better at other locations.","4, 1, 4, 4, 1"

Toasted almonds on top, adding more decadence to this mildly sweet and nutty slice of heaven Seating was a little difficult, it's always super crowded so I got lucky getting a little table on the second floor. Great place to get work done or to just take a breather from work> I was about to drive to Montréal from Boston but first I needed to refuel with a quick breakfast, so luckily I stumbled across Caffe Nero! This small little shop features plenty of sandwiches, pastries, and of course beverages. The staff was friendly enough when I was there and had me in and out pretty quick. I ended up just ordering an orange juice and a small croissant sandwich. I'm not really sure what I expected from the croissant sandwich but it didn't really have much egg or bacon inside of it, it was not very filling, but it did taste pretty good. The orange juice definitely tasted locally made and that was pretty darn good. Overall, this is probably a great place to stop if you drink coffee, but I can't speak on that. What I can say is that they've got some alright food and some banging orange juice. Come check them out for yourself!> I'll stop in on occasion for a caffeine pick-me-up before a show at the Boston Opera House. It always seems busy, but the baristas always seem quick so the line moves along. Love the coffee, although last trip I got a double shot espresso because we were cutting it close. I love the atmosphere here, and the seats are comfy.> This was a cool quiet space. Reminds me of a Starbucks. Everyone just hanging around after buying their drinks. We got the chai latte  and matcha latte. The chai latte was richer in favor and the matcha latte was to milky. Not a bad place to hang around> I have mixed feeling about this coffee place. Although the place is just steps away from my office, I would choose to walk a bit more to Pret to pick up my breakfast in the morning!!* Their croissants are just okay!! Even when I ask to heat up, they are not as crunchy as Pret or Starbuck, so Nero is not my number 1 choice for breakfast in the morning* Staffs friendliness: I have mixed feeling about this too. I guess it depends on who you see, but there're at least 2 staffs that should learn how to smile to customers given a customer facing job. They are grumpy every time I stop by, not just to me and speak to each other in their language. However, there are other people in different shifts who are more CHEERFUL to customers!! A simple smile makes a huge different!!* Drink: I love the mango smoothie here!! Sooo yummy!!! * Setting: nice set up to stay for a catch up with friends or to work or study!!

Five Guys in general tastes like a burger I could make at home and the fries are usually soggy - however, they give a loott. They fill the cup and then add multiple scoops into the bag (1 large fries came with 2.5 cups worth)!!The food isn't the greatest, but it does hit the spot if you're craving it.

This place must have new management or something since all of these negative reviews happened. I had the clan chowder and a burger. Both were hot and great. My food came out super fast. No complaints other than that the beer menu could use some more variety.> We arrived at around 1030pm on a Saturday to check in to the Marriott hotel, where the restaurant is.  We were tired & starving & hoping for a quick & decent bite.  Turns out, our server Patricia was super friendly, & the food here very good.  The bar was pretty busy, & people were getting takeout too.Patricia thoughtfully seated us at a larger booth so we had room to pull up our luggage.  When we told her we were starving & asked if we could order as she seated us, she was ready to go!Literally 5 minutes later, we had a big bowl of hot creamy delicious chowder to share in front of us, with 2 spoons & 2 packets of oyster crackers.Barely 10 minutes after that, & we each had a big, stuffed with lightly mayo'd lobster, lobster roll with sides of melted butter, hot, crispy sweet potato fries & ketchup in front of us.Patricia was on top of her game - checking on us, refilling waters, and being warm & friendly.Amazing service, & very good food!  Perfect!> Great restaurant in a hotel. Our wait staff, Debbie S.  Recommended the lobster roll. WOW!  It was fabulous !  Tons of huge pieces of lobster. My husband's burger was perfect. Delicious restaurant in a hotel. Very surprising!!> I must admit, as a hotel restaurant I was not expecting much. But, we had a great meal!. The restaurant has been newly refurbished. We had a bunch of different food including a salad, chicken nuggets, lobster roll, soup and wine. Everything was great. The service was spot on. Several people helping us. I've seen some the other reviews, and I have to say I don't understand the negative reviews. We loved it. Check it out!!> It took a while to get seated even though there were very few guests. Waitstaff once we were seated were friendly and we had our food quicker than i expected. Food was fine, not amazing, not bad. A little pricey for the quality.","5, 5, 4, 5, 3"

Bottega, the savior of the day! Nothing here is particularly spectacular -- that is, except the TRUFFLE PASTA. Most of the pasta here is good, but when I tell you the truffle pasta with prosciutto here is phenomenal, you better believe it. And an easy $9 dish to boot ;).> Cold gnocchi, cold sauce, and not spicy. I've never heard of gnocchi being served cold, and when I order something with hot peppers next to it on the menu, I expect it to have at least some kick to it. Not sure what we waited for since everything was cold anyway. Felt awkward sitting there, like the guy behind the counter wanted us to leave.> One thing that I heard about this place was that they have $5 pasta on Tuesdays (could be getting the day wrong). I used to live near here so I figured, why not try it out?Honestly, I can't remember which pasta I ordered but it was pretty good! Especially for the value. Seating in here is a nightmare/limited so be prepared for it to be packed/eat outside if you can!> Writing 15 minutes after delivery. Ordered via Yelp (literally Yelp still has delivering tracking going despite it being delivered). The Boy found a hair in his Italian. Even prior to that though, at first bite we found the sandwiches average at best. Honestly below average given that this came from an Italian restaurant. What did it to me is that both of our sandwiches were warm. It's a cold cut deli sandwich shouldn't be served warm. I've never had their pasta but maybe they should stick to that. Definitely hesitant to try it though because of this hair situation.> It's one of the restaurants that it is good/decent but nothing extremely attracting enough to go back for me. The portion of the food is quite small, as compared to what you pay. $13 for a linguine cream shrimp (small size) pasta dish was not satisfying. The sauce was not enough either. I am glad that I tried this place though.","4, 2, 3, 1, 3"

Best Caribbean restaurant in Boston. I recommend everything and definitely the curry mango, curry beef and pelau> Great hole in the wall Caribbean spot. I wish these more commonplace in Boston. The lady working was really friendly and she joked with me about them not serving doubles. Also they are halal, big plus. I got a medium roti (plenty big), with boneless curry chicken, channa, cabbage, and pepper sauce. Probably the most classic roti combo. AND an ginger beer. For the uninitiated here is a quick history/cultural lesson. Caribbean/West Indian food is food from countries like Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana, and Jamaica, NOT India. There is an overlap of seasoning, flavors, and dishes because when Caribbean countries were colonies of the British Empire, indentured servants were brought from India to work the fields since slavery had been made illegal. This lead to Indo-Caribbean's bringing their food and culture to the new land. And so roti exists in a much different form here than it does in the Indian subcontinent. It's NOT a burrito, don't eat it like one. You can eat it with a fork and knife or unwrap it and rip off pieces and scoop the filling with your hand. ~the more u know ~> If you are looking for a quick lunch or take out this is the place to come . Several hot food selections to pick to go with your rice and veggies. Oxtail , curry chicken , shrimp , curry meat , goat etc. prices  are decently priced and there's only one lady to serve you of your selection . Overall it's a good pit stop for a quick eat.> Oh my god! So good.It's always the same order. A small roti with chicken curry. You get two sides with a small roti - I go for the spiced potatoes and the mango curry. The chicken curry is flavored really well, even a small bite is like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. The chicken is seasoned well and tender. As for the sides, the mango curry is a wonderful balance of sweet and spice (and everything nice). The mango itself is cooked well and has a hint of sour to it - goes superbly well with the chicken. The potatoes help balance all the curries. There is a little bit of heat in the curries, some days more than others! I'm not sure what the roti is made of (it's not like the tandoori roti you get at Indian restaurants) but, oh my, it goes well with the curry and the sides. Also, one time, they were out of the roti (we got there 15 mins before closing time). So the staff substituted rice for the roti, which was delicious too!.Don't let the outside fool you. It may not look like much but give the food a try and you'll want it every day. The staff isn't very talkative but they are very nice and accommodating. This is definitely a favorite!> I went here on Saturday, December 14th around 3pm. I got the chicken curry roti and my partner got the shrimp plate. The food was tasty and we loved the hot sauce. However, around 7/8pm my stomach started hurting and I then had the most horrific vomiting and diarrhea in my adult life.  It finally subsided around 2am, but more than 24 hours later I am weak, have a headache, fatigue, and muscle soreness. My partner was fine so it was definitely the chicken and I noticed the chicken wasn't very warm and I suspect that is what caused the food poisoning from hell.","5, 5, 4, 5, 1"

Come for the dessert but must say the Chicken Caprese Sandwich was fantastic, really enjoyed the pesto sauce and the waffle fries dusted in cocoa powder The White Chocolate Russian was one of the best I've ever had, probably because they use their restaurant's white chocolate. Also our server, Zoe was phenomenal! Very personable and extremely attentive. I feel like more often than not at many restaurants the service is lacking just because servers forget to the basics. We later ordered the fondue to share and wow. I wish I brought more friends. The plate is HUGE. Includes a waffle, crepe, strawberries, brownies, and more. I've tried all three of the chocolates you can choose from and I'd say for dipping top two are Milk and Dark chocolate and it's a total tie. Wait for the fondue was a bit long but because of that without us even mentioning anything, Zoe was quick to remove it off the bill which made the trip that much sweeter Anyways definitely the spot for all things dessert! Honestly would suggest coming on an empty stomach and just skipping dinner. So so many awesome menu items and not enough room haha. Can't wait to come back soon!> Located on Boylston Street, across the Pru, is a great chocolate dessert place called Max Brenner! I came here with a bunch of friends on the first day of restaurant week and was a little bummed out they weren't offering any fondue as part of the restaurant week menu, but nevertheless excited to see weekend lunch options. Max Brenner is more on the casual side, so you get 3 courses for $20. Once you walk through the door, you get a sugary whiff of chocolate in their lobby. Our waiter was a bit confused about how the restaurant week menu worked since everyone in our party decided to take advantage of the opportunity. We all ordered and waited at least half an hour and was wondering what took so long for our appetizers to come out. Turns out, they waited until all 3 courses of our orders were ready and starting bringing out the entrees and appetizers at the same time. They were going to bring out the desserts too, but we told them to wait because we hadn't even eaten anything and there was no room on the table. I don't believe this is the first year that Max Brenner has done Restaurant week, so I would have expected servers and staff to know a more efficient way of giving out our food.  Onto the food, I ordered the bbq wings with blue cheese dressing, the cheeseburger with waffle fries, and the chocolate waffles for dessert. The portions were large considering restaurant week usually is given a bit less, so it was definitely the most bang for your buck! the bbq wings were standard and had a good amount of sauce on them to add flavor, but didn't make your hands too messy. The cheeseburger wasn't anything special and the waffle fries were supposed to come with chocolate dusting, but they didn't. :( I was looking forward to chocolate fries, but that extra touch was missing. The waffle fries were a thick cut and crunchy. The highlight of the meal was, of course, the chocolate waffles for dessert. The waffles came with hot melted milk chocolate that you can drizzle over, which added another layer of chocolate. They also came with a side of mushy strawberries. The waffles were good, but I do wish it came with another scoop ice cream to combat the extra sweetness of the chocolate for both waffles. I'd only recommend coming here for the desserts especially if you're having chocolate cravings.> Came here for ""Galentine's day"" to catch up with a friend and we split the sharing fondue with white chocolate and milk chocolate. Fondue is always fun since it's an active experience, but can be quite the sweetness overload even for someone with a sweet tooth! I skipped dinner since I knew it would be a lot of food, and I'm glad I did. The sharing fondue was great because we got to try a good variety of chocolate and desserts.I was nervous to come here at first since I saw some negative Yelp reviews ahead of time that mentioned mice, but thankfully I did not see any mice. My main gripe is that our waitress was a bit off-putting. She looked like she'd rather be literally anywhere else in the world. At one point, one of our candles under the fondue got extinguished and she gave us the most dead-eyed look when we asked her to reignite it. All in all, I would probably only come back to split the sharing fondue with friends on a special occasion.> Max Brenner is a cute restaurant that catches your eye when you walk by. It smells delicious and there are cute little chocolate-themed aspects about the restaurant itself.The food was average; fun to try once but not something I would crave. We ordered a cheese fondue trio (subbing out the Bleu cheese for an additional cheddar) that came with vegetables, bread, pretzel bites, etc. The cheddar beer cheeses were okay, nothing to rave about, and the spinach artichoke dip was essentially just hot spinach with a little cheese holding it together. The pretzel bites were dry af, but everything else was fine. We would have preferred to know what comes on the plate before we ordered so we could have subbed out the parsnips & celery for more bread.Service was mediocre at best. We didn't know our server's name (she never introduced herself) and we didn't get water refills. As two former service-industry workers, we were a bit disappointed.As for dessert, it's a chocolate themed restaurant so you would think this is where they shine! Unfortunately, the platter we ordered was just ""good"" (not great, not spectacular, and definitely not a must). We subbed out some of the dips for more fruit and I do have to say it was PLENTY for two people. We both left feeling stuffed to the gills.Overall, I probably wouldn't feel the need to come again. It's a bit pricey considering the quality of the food and the level of service. I prefer Melting Pot instead as my fondue restaurant of choice.> I came on a weekday evening for pre-valentines day dessert with my boyfriend. It was ridiculously crowded, which was not surprising given the holiday. We were seated at a tiny table with one of the chairs squished against another chair from a different table - not the most comfortable set up. We ordered the Spectacular Melting Chocolate S' Mores Sundae to share. I was really happy with how huge the sundae was when it came out! I loved the marshmallow and chocolate fudge combination. The sides of white chocolate and whipped cream were also nice to have! While I did enjoy the sundae, I didn't think it was worth the price at all. Our waitress was very kind and attentive. I had no service complaints. Overall, we had a good time, but probably won't be back for a while since the food is definitely overpriced in my opinion.","5, 3, 3, 3, 3"

We had a great time and a great meal!> Good but not great for the price. I wanted to try the chow chow noodles because I had heard such good things! The noodles were good but felt extremely heavy. Maybe it's oil but it was not a light meal and we shared one dish between two of us. We also had drinks and an app.The appetizer (Tsel Phaley) was great and unique. Haven't eaten anything like it! Noodles in a crepe with some awesome sauce on the side. Highly recommend. The entree was about $16 and the app was $6. The entree was way overpriced but the app was great and I'd eat it again.I expected to want to come back but I definitely won't be dropping by. I'd recommend coming in a group to try different dishes but from our experience there are way better options out there!> Such a hidden gem of Boston. We stop by every once in a while for the buffet lunch and have always loved their flavorful dishes, but this time was really unique. The most intriguing was a pork belly/mustard green dish in some pungent fish sauce, which we loved, and we also appreciated the okra! Dishes are typically very unique, with an array of breads (momos, fried bread, and a thin bouncy bread) which soak up the flavorful sauces. A lot of healthy veggie-focused options too. Love to finish the meal with some hot chai. Really solid quality with distinctive flavors and the buffet makes it an unbelievable value. Attentive, friendly service but they give you your space too. A go-to place!> This is a really nice spot with a great lunch buffet with many vegetarian options of Tibetan food. I think it's a little over priced, if you compare it to Indian buffets (both have vegetarian and chicken options).Also, as someone who traveled in Tibet and the Tibetan villages in India, I missed the dumplings (momo)... maybe they could add those to their buffet too?> Oh myyyy god the lunch buffet is to die for. Great variety of hot food, salad-y greens and veggies, fruit, lentil soup, and hot tea. Didn't see any other dessert dishes though?Come early to get a spot for lunch. We arrived at 11:30 when it opened which was a fantastic idea. Let me repeat again: the food is amazing. Wish the buffet island was a little more accessible but oh well didn't really detract from the experience.I will say I came here another time a couple years ago where I ordered a meatball soup dish for dinner and was underwhelmed.

If this was the way it would end, then I fully embraced it.Thank you Miss Maisie Williams Blonde Sister, cheers to you and your beverage.Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe, as they say.> City Bar is a great hotel bar.  It is truly one of the best! Visitors are greeted by the scent of the Lenox hotel. It is very distinct and pleasant. After walking through the hotel lobby, the bar itself has romantic, dim lighting.  I especially enjoy the bar as it does not have a flatscreen television. Instead, there is a tasteful picture on the wall, overlooking the bar that changes colors.The decor is modern and elegant.  It is a cozy environment.  If you decide not to sit at the bar, there is a cushy couch or tables that align the walls.  There is a variety of great menu options.  My favorite is the pasta!  There is a made from scratch pasta option that changes each day of the week. I highly recommend this bar, whether you are a local resident or if you are staying at the Lenox hotel.","5, 5, 1, 5, 5"

THE UPSIDE DOWN PINEAPPLE CAKE WAS AMAAAAAAAZINNNGGG!> Great place for a drink after work, the bar gets busy on weekdays, but seating for dinner doesn't seem to be an issue which was good. We stopped in for drinks and apps so didn't try much in the way of a full meal, but the service was quick, friendly and attentive - no complaints there. The beer selection was pretty good, I liked the couple of seasonal options they had. The pretzels were hot and came with room temperature cheese and mustard - pretty standard, but good overall. The nachos were very crunchy but could have used more toppings. I think they layered everything because once we got to the bottom of the place all the cheese was on a just a few chips. Although we did get them with chicken on top and that was charred and juicy - makes me think that a full meal would be tasty here.Overall this is a great little spot to hang out for a while after work and grab a quick bite. I'd stop in again and try some of their actual meal items to see how those hold up.> I came in for takeout and waited at the bar with a beer (Sam Adams Summer Ale). The bar tender was very nice and quick. It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready.Pesto chicken sandwich: tasty and very fresh. I think it needs a little salt. Or something. Not sure.Steak and cheese: in a hoagie. Quite good!The fries were great.If I have the chance I'll definitely come back.> we were in Boston and had a nice lunch here. Great beer selection, very good service. Salads withgrillwd chicken and one with Tuna, perfectly prepared.> Excellent sweet potato fries, clam chowder 10+, Mac & Cheese w/steak tips a 9. All the food that passed by our table looked awesome.","4, 3, 4, 4, 4"

This is a classic Boston hotel bar. Very classy, dimly lit, dark wood. If you drink whiskey, order the Irish  Rose. They prepare it tableside and there's a whole elaborate presentation and story to go along with it.  You have to see it. It's amazing! My friend got this drink and said it was delicious and smooth. Best $18 bucks spent-- for the drink and the presentation. Our server was lovely...very professional yet personable, you could see she loved her job, and she was super knowledgeable so if you needed a recommendation she could help pick the perfect drink for you (we were a party of 6 and everyone loved the drinks they got). Oh and the free bar snacks! House made tortilla chips and a mix of olives, pickled peppers, pickled onions. They were great. I would love to come back again and will plan to. A wonderful experience was had.> classy bar. dark and moody with a rich soul in its' bones. you can feel it. sat at the bar and ordered a couple rounds and a charcuterie. great service and strong drinks. highly recommend.> The servers here just seem to love their job. They are so pleasant and helpful, it makes you want to stay longer. Had a nice generous pour of wine. They let us do a small sample tasting to determine which chardonnay and cabernet we wanted in full glass. The little treats they bring to the table are a nice touch. Would go there even if didn't stay there.> Food and atmosphere was good but the service has something very much to be desired. After a night out, our group went for some appetizers and a night cap. The server was prompt but came across disingenuous. At one point he suggested he had 2 different Pappy Van Winkles I could have. With no one at our table drinking whiskey my only assumption is he was trying to take advantage of people he thought had no idea the cost, or was too intoxicated to decide. At the end of the night once our bill was split he switched around prices on our bills after signing. Weather it was on purpose or mistake he tried passing it of as ""taxes fluctuate"". Finally things were sorted out and we left. Still waiting to see if our card gets double charged.> We loved this bar! It's cozy and comfortable. If you're there, ask for Mary Ellen to serve you. She's amazing and so interesting, too. And she provided us with so much information on Boston and the wharf area.","5, 4, 5, 2, 5"

I ordered the ACQUA PAZZA which is basically a bunch of seafood in a tomato sauce. It's huge!  If you love seafood, this is perfect for you. Highly recommended spot!> Took 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. I finally flagged down a waiter who wasn't ours to help us get someone assigned to us. Finally when we got our waiter, my friend and me immediately put in our drink order and an order of their aranchinis for an app. They came out pretty speedy, but when I bit into the aranchini, it was still FROZEN in the middle. Like ice cold. The cheese wasn't even melted. We of course send it back. One of the managers brought out a new batch that were fine. My friend and I ordered drinks, an app, mains, and each got a dessert (we were celebrating!) and Nebo didn't even take off the $10 aranchinis. Just an awful experience for a restaurant that's in the heart of Boston. 2 stars because our mains were very good.> Ordered takeout from here. Three pizzas: two Traditionales (3.0/5.0) and one Margherita (3.0/5.0). Considering they were simple cheese pizzas, I didn't have unreal expectations. The crust and cheese were good, but not greatTo be honest I expected more, because we paid around 55 for three cheese pizzas. The ambiance seemed real nice but I don't know if I'll come back for another meal.Peace \/> Ohh Nebo Cucina had me indulging in more cocktails than I meant to but who can say no to a Bellini flight?The Bellini flight consisted of four different flavors (strawberry, raspberry, peach and mango) and each of them were delicious. Highly recommend it to share for $17. I also shared the Tagliatelle cappesante which had three delicious jumbo scallops on top of a bed of lemony creamy pasta. Then for dessert, I had one of their espresso cocktails which was delicious. Be prepared to drop some dough here for dinner. However if you are looking forward to a fancy Italian dinner, Nebo Cucina certainly did not disappoint in their food and drinks.> Gluten free HEAVEN in Boston. The food was delicious, great service, yummy drinks. My boyfriend took me here as a surprise, and when we walked in they asked if we needed a GF menu. The waiter asked about allergies. All around super knowledgeable - the most comfortable I've felt as Celiac in Boston. Scallop pasta was super good, recommended by our waiter. GF calamari was delish, too! All around wonderful experience. I'm already begging to go back.","5, 2, 3, 4, 5"

never tried this place before. It's on the same block with Bon Chon, pho Le, etc., The restaurant was empty so my husband and I were a little hesitated when we were seated. We ordered Szechuan fish fillet, beef with watercress, calamari, Jo Jo Taipei seafood hot and sour soup, and fried chicken. The food was actually really good except the fried chicken. Everything was well seasoned. My husband's favorite was the beef with watercress. Our waitress was very nice to us. The experience overall was good.> This Taiwanese spot definitely deserves more credit. They serve some great foods at affordable prices and are flavorful! The restaurant is big and has plenty of seating, also able to accommodate large parties. They have lunch special deals that are decent and are lunch sized portions. They also have other menu items that are great for serving parties that want to have a family style meal (which I recommend so that you get to try more dishes). The food comes out fairly quick and the staff is attentive.I enjoyed most of the dishes on their menu and definitely recommend the three cup chicken, a classic Taiwanese dish that you can't go wrong with. The salt and pepper calamari is also very good. I also enjoyed this diced chicken cooked with red pepper dish. They have ranges of spicy and non spicy dishes to satisfy both flavor palates. The lunch menu items are decent and have some good things on it but otherwise, it's very starchy and takes like a better version of Chinese take out. The bowls of rice are small but perfect portions to go with the meal.I also enjoy their appetizer items as well. The scallion pancake with beef is not bad. The scallion pancake is very thick and dense but has a good crusty outer layer. Since it's dense though, it doesn't have enough sauce inside to accommodate it.I haven't tried their shaved ice but I've heard great things about it.> My new favorite taiwanese place in Boston! Authentic taste, fast service, good ambiance, and reasonable prices. I love that their dishes are not overly oily! Would recommend this over some of the taiwanese places in chinatown. Came with a few friends on a weeknight and was seated right away at a big round table with a lazy susan. We ordered 6 dishes: pig ears: not very flavorful, mostly just the taste of sesame oil. 3/5three cup cuttlefish: very tender cuttlefish. the sauce was very good but a bit too sweet. although maybe the three cup chicken will be better. 4/5dry cooked chicken: pretty good! definitely recommend 5/5sautéed chinese melon: the melon tasted a little weird, like maybe some residual soap had not been washed off?? not sure... 3/5mushroom hot pot: I love mushrooms so I really liked this dish! There was a lot of mushrooms in there. 5/5taiwanese noodle soup (non-spicy): a bit too sweet for me but there were huge chunks of meat in there. we all really liked it! 5/5Overall a pretty authentic restaurant with a large menu. I will definitely be back.> If you are looking for authentic Taiwanese food, look away! This place is run by Chinese people - not a single Taiwanese employee when we went - and everything is too spicy. It is definitely Jo Jo Szechuan, so the fact that it advertises itself as Taipei is both dishonest and misleading.The pork lo mein was really good. Soup dumplings were okay but nothing to write home about. Minced pork rice was okay but lacking both meat and sauce - heavy on the rice. Despite the extensive menu options, everything else was terrible. We had them make the Dan Dan noodles less spicy, but they were still spicy. Ma po tofu always has pork in it, but Jo Jo's was vegetarian and overpriced. The salt and pepper chicken is an even worse buy than the ma po tofu! It looks like huge pieces in the picture because there are huge BONES in the chicken. Authentic salt and pepper chicken does not contain any bones. Once again restaurant being cheapos as it's 85% bone.> For me, the only plus side of coming here is that there is no wait. However, the food didn't taste very good and the service wasn't good despite the restaurant not being very busy, so I don't see myself coming back here.Pan fried dumplings - My friends and I felt like these tasted a bit off. One person thought it was too salty; I thought it was a bit sour. In any case, it didn't taste quite authentic or good.Stewed minced pork over rice with egg - This was probably the best dish out of what we had. I thought the minced pork could have had more flavor as it was a bit bland, but it was still pretty good.Lotus cake - I'm not usually a huge fan of lotus cake but this was pretty good. Again, might be a bit bland, but dip it in sauce and it's enjoyable.There were a couple other dishes that we ordered but none of the really stood out as delicious. Each one seemed to be either too bland or too extreme in some type of taste (usually salty or sour).As for service, it seems that the restaurant forgot a couple of our orders until we asked about them (we heard them shouting the order to the chefs after we mentioned them). Even though we ordered mostly appetizers, it took about 30 minutes for all the food to come out.","5, 4, 4, 1, 2"

This is the season for them to shine! I live near this place but definitely don't come here enough. You definitely can't go wrong with getting any of the beef soups! Its classic. The last time I came here, I got the Beef Stew Rice Noodle Soup! For between $11-$13 you get a super piping hot bowl of soup. Remember to blow your noodles/soup before eatin or 90% chance itll burn you hahaha you won't be able to taste any amazing foods for days, I promise! All tables have small jars of chilli oil and such for adding more flavor to your noodle soup if needed. The noodles are thick, but they aren't dense at all. You don't feel clogged after eating :) good stuff.All staff speak English and Mandarin. I feel like most of the time, they default to speaking Mandarin if they think you might speak it, but don't feel shy, they can speak both!I've once tried the soy milk a while ago, maybe when they first opened. I wasn't a huge fan of how chunky it was, but the noodle soups here are worth raving over :)> Awesome dine-in experience! The reasons of why it is a 4-star-awesome but not a 5-star-awesome: noisy milkshake machine. It's way too loud for a small restaurant.Authentic Yunnan rice noodle. The soup is really delicious! The hot boiling soup served in a iron pot cooks all ingredients in a second right at your table. This kind of experience combining with the carefully made soup and rice noodles makes this restaurant a must-go-again place. Service is great! The waitress was really friendly and patient when serving the hot boiling soup. She also made really good recommendations for the items on the menu. Good job!Last but not the least, the parking is really easy! Amber parking on the street, or right in the municipal parking lot net to the restaurant. Please buy a quieter milkshakes machine :-) Or please find a solution to make a small cubicle for that machine.> Got the spring roll appetizers and tofu vegetable noodle soup. The noodles were really good, and the peanuts had a nice crunch, and were unexpected. Tofu was tasty too. The broth was a bit strong for  me. My friend  had stir fried noodles with a quail egg on top. I liked the candy they gave you for dessert. I've never  had it before. It's this creamy tasting Chinese sucking candy with a fun cartoon on the wrapper.> *municipal parking lot available in the back*What I enjoy most about the menu here is that I'm not overwhelmed by a cluster of options. The noodles here range from $9-$13 which is great and their noodles, and soup, are absolutely delicious. The noodle is nice, tender and medium-sized thick, and their soup has tons of flavor, but isn't overpowering. The beef noodle in house made soup was so savory and satisfying; highly recommend you get this if it's your first time here! We also had the fried pig ear which was a nice compliment to our main meal. Customization is also a part of the experience since you can order an additional noodle portion, or any add-on toppings to your noodle entree. There's a NY location as well and I will be going there in the near future :)> What a surprise! My cousins were telling me the Yunnan Crossing Bridge story and it intrigued me to give this place a try. It's known for its authentic  Yunnan cuisine. There is a parking lot out back, which is always a plus in Boston. The interior is a traditional Chinese restaurant layout, very clean and has multiple tables. We started off with the classic Sliced Pork Ear and Spicy Beef Tripe in Chili Sauce. The portions were tiny for the price, however, it was super tasteful. The pig ear was cooked perfectly that there was still a good crunch. The beef tripe had great spices, I couldn't stop eating it. For the main, what I came here for, I ordered the Rice noodle soup in clay pot. In my opinion, my entree was better than all my friends'! It's rice noodle with braised pork and vegetables cooked in a clay pot. I feel like the clay pot helped keep the flavors within. Their special broth is extremely tasteful. You can always add toppings, including more noodles! It's a quaint place to go to for a quick meal. I will definitely be back!","5, 4, 4, 4, 4"

One week, my sister was away and he gave us an extra ice cream free of charge to take home for her.Today, I was quite hungry and decided to get a meal from here. Very worth it. For $10 I got the pasta, garlic bread, and a salad. When I got there he asked me if I had an umbrella to got home. Food was good, I'm definitely going to get it again.All said and done, $10 for a very filling meal to some of the nicest people is well worth it, I highly recommend going if you get the chance.> My boyfriend insisted that we come here for the green monster ice cream when I was in town, and I'm so glad we did! The portion size is huge so it's more than enough to share. It was also the most incredible mint ice cream I have ever had. The mint ice cream comes with cookies and cream and chocolate swirl. It's the perfect level of soft and such a great treat to bring to the park across the street! The customer service here is incredible, and they were so friendly to both of us. They also recognize my boyfriend so it was really nice to feel so welcomed in a new area. I went a second time and the cookie dough ice cream was so great as well!The cozy shop is located on a corner. If you're in the mood to sit there, there's seating available. However, it's not far from two huge parks with fountains that you can bring your ice cream to and enjoy the outdoors! :-)> I ate the pasta with roasted peppers, loved it. I found it perfect.Would come back again.","4, 5, 5, 5, 4"
