Carmelina's is a small restaurant in the North end with amazing Italian food. I've been here several times and have always been pleased with the food. There is a TV screen in here too if you want to watch sports.I love the fried calamari, its the perfect appetizer to share with the table. Its not overly covered in bread crumbs which is nice. I have had the frutti del mar past which comes with a generous amount of seafood. I also really enjoyed the Tonno con Pesto Siciliano e Fusilli- fussili pasta with tuna steak on top. I know this is a rather unusual dish but it was so good, sort of like east meet west in your pasta dish.Its also conveniently located close to Mike's Pastry so you can go there for dessert!> I thought the food here was just okay...definitely didn't live up to the hype.Rollati di Pasta : I enjoyed the al dente pasta on the dish, however, everything was way underseasoned.  Being that I generally eat on the less salty side, that's actually saying a lot. Frutti De Mare : The flavor on this dish was good, and the seafood was fresh, however, I couldn't get over why all the mussells on my dish were cold.  They could have at least heated up the mussells before throwing it into the pasta.  Maybe we came on an off night because we left quite disappointed.  3 stars.> AMAZING FOOD!My go to place in the North End. Small and quaint with an open kitchen and super friendly staff!Scratch cooking with everything they offer. Your palate will be so happy for the fresh ingredients. Everyone has to eat here!> Late flight (less than 50% full) arrival from SFO, looking for dinner, got a great referral from hotel and Yelp. Walked over, 10 PM, kitchen still open!A few people at the bar, quick service, loquacious Italian server. Ordered branzino, and wife had amitriciana. So nice to get piping hot food. Servings, as usual in the north end, too big, branzino was well prepared, maybe a little too cooked, could have been firmer, pasta delicious. Nice bottle of elio Grasso 2018 Dolcetto. If we go back, we will be splitting the main, so we can try some antipasti.> Carmelina's is the number one restaurant in the North End for a reason.  Every time I go the food is perfect.  My family was in town this weekend and it knocked their socks off.  This is no easy feat since we are full Italian!  Everything is made from scratch, even their stocks they cook with.We started with the Risotto Caprese and it was fantastic.  This dish is basically caprese in risotto form. It was fresh and light and packed a ton of flavor!  For our main dishes we ordered the baked 4 mushroom rigatoni, carbonara, Sundaymacaroni, and the penne capricciose.  The hit of the dinner was the hit of the dinner!  The sauce it came in was creamy and sweet, probably one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.The food comes out whenever its ready and steaming hot!  Our waiter was friendly and offered menu item suggestions based on our preferences!  For drinks we ordered peach bellinis which was refreshing (and heavy on the champagne)!  I will be coming back here because Carmelinas is a DREAM!  Make reservations a couple weeks ahead of time because it fills up quick!",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Last time I got chicken liver, duck pashtet, chorizo with cream cheese and onion jam. Everything tasted incredible. Plate came with hot bread. Pickles and mustard. Their pizza is a must try too. This time I got all meat pizza with different parts of pig and some greens on top. I with my stomach was bigger, so I can eat more things here. The service is welcoming and attentive. We didn't have to wait for our seats and a server almost immediately got our drink order. The atmosphere was nice too. It has some rusty industrial looking vibe inside. It's not quite but not too loud too. Perfect for a date night or after work beer and meat.> Good place a for quick bite! I wouldn't recommend this place for the busy hours during dinner time. Not sure if 40+ mins wait is worth. I went there again for a lunch, it was a very clean place, ample amount of space for a normal conservation and dine.We ordered two pizzas, one of them was too salty but okay. It was enjoyable but not memorable for me to give 5 stars. Recommend! Would like to visit again.> Came here for an early dinner on a weekend night. We made a reservation in case, but the restaurant was around half full and we were seated immediately. I brought my date here because I'd been here several years ago and remembered how good the boards were. The last time I was here they had bone marrow but the waiter told us that they had unfortunately taken it off the menu. We decided on pork sausage, lamb pate, and chicken liver terrine for our meats, with camambrie, four fat cheese, and goat gouda for our cheeses, as well as shallot jam. Both of us really enjoyed the board and the atmosphere was good - our favorites were the lamb pate, chicken liver, and camambrie. The pork sausage was listed as being spiced with ginger and nutmeg but wasn't as interesting or unique as we had hoped - it tasted fine but felt just okay and was unexciting compared to the other meats. The sweet shallot jam and pickles pair really well with the salty meats and cheeses, and the waiter promptly brought us more bread upon request once we'd run out. Between the two of us we were able to finish around half the board - we didn't have the biggest appetites before dinner - and the waiter boxed up our leftovers in a pizza box. It feels odd to not finish a charcuterie board, but everything was so rich and savory that we filled up! He even put the shallot jam and mustard in condiment containers so they didn't mix with everything else. Overall the service was prompt and friendly - he politely pointed out the cheese upon request when we were confused about the camambrie and four fat fowl. In the future I'll definitely be back again! This is a great way to taste local meats and cheese and both feel fancy and get a little messy with your hands.> We came in late Friday night @ around 11:30 and got a pizza before the kitchen closed. Our server was awesome, he was patient and offered an excellent suggestion. We went with the Alice Bocca.  Homemade pork sausage, broccoli rabe, montasio cheese with a cauliflower cream sauce. It was very tasty. Our waiter recommended it since we had a tomato allergy in our group. We were worried about the cauliflower cream sauce, because we're not really ""those people"" but you couldn't taste straight cauliflower at all and it was very flavorful. The homemade sausage was very good as well. We want to come back in again sometime, to order off the full menu. Because of how late we got there, we only got to order off the late night menu so some items weren't available. Their charcuterie looked awesome but we really just wanted a quick bite before heading back to the hotel and this hit the spot. The pizzas are closer to personal sized in my opinion. We split one but I could have easily finished one on my own if I were really hungry.> Stopped by for dinner with a friend on Thursday and was able get a seat right away (6pm) without a reservation. Ordered a charcuterie board with prosciutto, game bird pate, Four Fat Fowl St. Stephen, and manchego  and it was fantastic. Will definitely go back for the Four Fat Fowl St. Stephen for sure. We also ordered the Margherita Pizza which was disappointing. Just wasn't that special. Will be back for the charcuterie board!!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Be prepared for a long wait since it is a small restaurant but the atmosphere feels like you're at home with family and the food was great! My orders for the night:Burrata Calamari Lobster RavioliSpinach Fettucine> Very disappointed in takeout tonight. We got the house special Zuppa Di Pesce for two, and very certain the lobster was not fresh (strong ammonia taste and smell). I hope this is a one-off during coronavirus, but I have to question this restaurant's competence and/or ethics after this experience.> I was looking on Yelp for a not-too-expensive Italian restaurant in the North End, and Giacomo's seemed like an amazing place to try. I stopped by with a friend on Wednesday evening at 6pm and waited outside for around 10 minutes. Walking inside, I realized how small the space was. We were seated by a very friendly waiter in a small table crammed by the windows and door entrance. I ordered the mussels & calamari linguine with fracomo sauce, & my friend ordered the fettuccini with salmon in a tomato cream sauce. The portions are very filling & the waiter would come to check up on us often.Only one star docked off because I was quite uncomfortable squished in the corner. I tried to move the table, but the waiter pushed it back in to make way for people entering.> We were by TD Garden and a friend wanted to take advantage of being by North End to stop by for an early dinner there.  I was game.We stopped by an ATM at the CVS ($3 fee) since Giacomo's is known to be cash only.  There were already lines formed outside both Daily Catch and Giacomo's, down the street from one another.  At least 4 parties were ahead of us, but the wait wasn't long.Once seated, we somehow managed to make our selections off the chalkboards posted on the walls before our waiter came by again.  Giacomo's is indeed generally rather affordable, with regular entree prices ranging from $16 (particularly for their vegetarian and chicken dishes) to $20 (for their grilled fish and fruitti di mare), and their House Special seafood dinner for 2 at $65, with a split plate charge of $10 per person (which we figured was for additional people sharing the house special).  Their Specials board was a different ballgame, pricing at $20/$22/$24/$30 (for a lobster pasta bake).We ordered an entree apiece to share:Fusilli Siciliana with eggplant, onions, mozzarella cheese in a plum tomato sauce $16Shrimp and Scallops served over linguini $18, with the Giacomo lobster sauce.Veal Marsala Prosciutto, Mushroom $17 with ZitiMy findings -Their pasta was cooked a bit long for al dente.The veal was a little tough.There were 3 shrimp and 4 scallops.The Giacomo sauce was the bomb!  5 stars.Service was responsive to my requests and refilled our water several times without our asking.   But we didn't get the pasta side to the veal till I asked, and when it came, the ziti was linguine.Next time, something with their Giacomo sauce again, and perhaps give their chicken parm a shot?> Love how small and cute the restaurant was. This place is a bit small so don't be surprised if you're side-by-side with another table. Employees are super friendly as well and don't rush you to order despite people waiting outside. My friend and I came here on a Monday night around 6:30pm and there was only one party ahead of us so we got in pretty quickly. I got the frutti di mare with fra como sauce. It was delicious and the price was great as well. The sauce wasn't that spicy fyi. There was a generous amount of seafood too. I think the only thing that they can improve on is providing different past options. The sauce I ordered didn't adhere well to the pasta noodles. My friend's sauce was less runny and didn't seem to have that issue. (I forgot what her sauce was). Note: this is cash only but there is an ATM across the street.

I used to enjoy the lobster roll a lot, so I brought my mom in my second visit, and my best friend from Hong Kong in my third visit (only 2 of us).I know this restaurant is very busy, so we arrived in late afternoon for dinner. First of all, the waitresses served us were no smile at all, maybe they don't like Asian. We ordered oysters and butter lobster rolls. The oyster took  15 mins to come, the quality were good, then we waited for another 25 to 30 mins (we came at the same time with some ladies beside us, but our lobster rolls just came when they left). It was tough to wait in this tiny restaurant that you may touch the stranger who sit next to you. Lobster rolls finally came and they were not even warm, and the French fries were crumbs, dry and overcooked.The worst experience is:- When we asked for bill, the waitress gave me a bill which was $99.94, then I gave her my credit card. When the waitress passed me the credit card bill to sign, I found that the amount they charged in my credit card was $118.62. I felt strange and checked the bill closely, I found that 20% gratuity is charged by themselves without asking me!!! The bill got a blank space for writing tips as well, if I didn't take a look at the bill carefully, then I would probably pay 20% (the gratuity they charged) + 15% (normal tips amount) by accident, which is ridiculous for this so-so service. Then I requested to void the credit card payment and paid by cash (skip 20%). I like lobster, I always try lobster rolls in different restaurants, actually many places serve good lobster rolls. You don't have to wait in long queue for this restaurant and stay in a tiny space like this. I really feel disappointed about this restaurant and I will not go again.> Despite the whole COVID-19 situation, even before Neptune Oyster was open, there was a line of people waiting for the gates to lift, and the doors to officially open so that they can enter. Lines are an excellent indication I was in for some good seafood. PRO TIP: do go early and line up. Seating is limited.My first time at NO and it's a small and tight capacity sit down dining area. The staff was already to go and sat you at the bar or at an actual table. I sat at a table because it's my mum's birthday lunch so I needed as much surface area to have food on the table. With that, the menu read a seafood lovers dream. There was so many items on the menu I wanted to try, however with some restraint, not to go overboard, I ordered for us and started off with the uni toast and infamous Johnnycakes. The uni toast is creamy, buttery and rich and it's the butter of the sea. No complaints there and then the johnnycake, that is just criminal. Wow! I'm so glad I ordered that because I heard such delicious reviews about it and it's dubbed a MUST GET.Then the big boys hit the table. The Triton Plateau was a sight! Aligned with oysters, calms, mussels, crab, lobster and shrimp! Whoa mama! Now I need to see the Neptune Plateau, I think it's 2 stacks of all the raw bar seafood goodness. That plateau on top of the uni toast and johnnycake filled mum and I already. But wait, I ordered more, I got us the scallops, which are huge and most importantly the best scallops I've had. MUST GET! And last but not least the Saturday special the monkfish saltimbocca. Oh yeah, mums birthday, we go big.Hands down the BEST seafood place I've been. Food is fresh and delicious. I absolutely cannot wait to go back and try the other items and specials and order again the scallops and Johnnycake.> While visiting Boston, I wanted to try the best seafood restaurant Boston had to offer. Initially, I tried visiting on a Saturday night. However, I was told the wait was a hour long. Therefore, instead, I paid a visit 10 minutes after they opened on Sunday. To my surprise, the wait was still an hour long - attesting to the popularity of this restaurant.After 45 minutes, I was finally seated at the bar. I had half a dozen oysters and a lobster roll. The oysters were exceedingly fresh and tasted exactly as described on their menu. The lobster roll was fantastic. Unlike other lobster rolls I've had, this one was packed with lobster and allowed the taste of lobster to present itself unadulterated. Other restaurants often drown their lobster rolls with seasoning and butter - but not this one. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend Neptune Oyster. That one hour wait is completely worth it!> Came here for Wednesday lunch to skip the long lines usually on weekends. No wait thankfully and got immediately seated.Very hyped for this place as it was supposed to be one of the KINGS of seafood in North End and even Boston as a whole.Ordered:1) Clam chowder (2/5): honestly wasn't very good. The chowder wasn't very flavourful like they almost forgot to season it or something. The clam was fresh and good at least. Also a big portion so you can share for two people. I would probably skip out on this...2) Lobster Roll with fries (6/5): probably the BEST lobster roll I've had.. (I've had lots of lobster rolls). This one stands out because the lobster was super fresh, bountiful, and delicious. The bun was nice and buttery. The fries were solid, as usual as fries goes. This can range anywhere from 25-45 depending on how much lobsters are in the market at the time.Started off sour as the clam chowder wasn't great. Thankfully the lobster roll saved the day. I would come back again just for the lobster roll if I am in the area and there isnt' a wait. Not worth the 5-6 hour wait or possibly more on the weekends.",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Not overwhelmed with mayo at all. The bun is lightly toasted with a buttery taste.Even the complementary water is Brita filter and chilled. That is a class touch I have not seen.  A must when in Back Bay.> Busy working lunch - needed a good go-to option for quality to-go ordersLukes was a simple click away and my team was well taken care of by the crew at Lukes Lobster Arrived for the pick up and all was ready to go !!The team enjoyed !!!> Really cute place! Came here to get the classic lobster roll, and it was pretty good! Well toasted bread, butter, and fresh lobster. We also got the combo and tried both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. Both were decent, but I liked the clam chowder better. The service here was really great though! I also liked how the combo came with cute drinks (I got a blueberry wildflower honey lemonade). I feel like definitely a staple for the Boston experience.> Really really good lobster roll!  I stopped in for a quick meal late evening just before they closed. Not busy, walked right up. I went for the Luke's Trio with soup. It's the combo of threee mini rolls and a cup of soup. Shrimp roll, crab roll, and a lobster roll. The meat was so sweet and delicious. The rolls slathered in butter and oh so perfectly toasted. I went with the cup of clam chowder (lobster bisque also an  option) and it was amazing. Creamy, delicious, and loaded with clams. The trio came with a drink and will usually just pass on the drink and opt for water I did indulge this time. Craft bottled root beer. Rounded out this simple yet absolutely delicious meal. Not cheap but not out of line for seafood, the trio was $29 and $31 if you had I it with the chowder like I did. I will be back for sure!> One of my to go spots when I'm in Boston, they are good quick and delicious. Every time I have visited Boston I come to Luke's. They don't disappoint. They have a good atmosphere and centrally located. The quality is really good as well, and the staff is amazing, sweet and helpful! If you're looking for a quick bite but also something that good and very delicious this is the spot. I usually get the hot lobster roll because it's buttery and delicious and my boyfriend likes the cold lobster roll which is also mouth-watering. Their clam chowder soup is also one of my favorites with a side of chip I am in heaven, writing this review is making me crave them and want a roll.

The first time I went, my party ordered an antipasto and were given two entire orders of it. The second time we went, we ended up waiting 20-25 min past our reservation time for our table to be ready. As a consolation, we were handed a calamari appetizer while we waited outside and then given some delicious shrimp to eat once we sat down. Both times we got tiramisu for dessert for free as well. As far as entrees go, I've tried the chicken carbonara and the seared chicken. I'm not the best judge of Italian food (I feel like Italian food from any less casual Italian place generally tastes pretty good), but I was a big fan of both. I would say another reason to come to Pomodoro is the ambiance. The restaurant doesn't really have its name anywhere in the front so it has a hole-in-the-wall feel. It has a cozy feel inside with only one waitress serving all 6-8 tables. I would love to come back here again on a special date night.Cons of Pomodoro are...1) It's cash only2) You'll have to make a reservation pretty early on if you want to eat on a weekend3) Service can be slow (it is a small place with only one waitress after all). Pomodoro has made its way onto my short list of restaurants I like bringing people from out of town to. I can't wait to come back.> Service 0/5Food 1/5Ambiance 1/5There are so many wonderful restaurants in the North End, but Pomodoro definitely is not one of them. First of all, be prepared that there is no sign, and Pomodoro is a bit hard to find. I thought it was actually part of Giacomo's.The inside of the restaurant is tiny. It maybe seats 30 people and is so loud. We were seated at this janky ""bar"". It reminded me of a cheesy bar that somebody would put in their 70's style basement/mancave. Our view was of the kitchen which was not a pleasant view.There was zero hospitality or warmth from the one waitress. She was inattentive and not friendly in the least.My daughter got the cod and it stunk, literally. She said it was flavorless and left 95% of it.I got the Chicken Carbonara and it was greasy and overpowered with pepper. It was nasty. If you like Spaghetti Carbonara, go down the street to Saraceno's, where it is amazing.> Wow, Pomodoro is one restaurant that lives up to the North End hype! It is *extremely* cozy (read: SMALL) so make a reservation if you can. I came here with 5 girl friends for dinner, and we had such a lovely time! Looking around, I saw families, group of friends, and definitely couple dates, so I encourage anyone looking for a cozy, family-home-kitchen vibe to consider this spot.To share, we ordered the bowl of mussels in tomato broth which was so delicious. We got 2 baskets of bread rolls and made sure the broth didn't go to waste!I ordered Seafood Fra Diavolo and really enjoyed it. Ton of seafood and generally huge portions (could say the same about the other pastas we ordered). Tasted very buttery and heavy though, so I couldn't even finish half of it.Come with the expectation that you will be absolutely stuffed walking out, and enjoy!> Pomodoro's atmosphere makes this place incredible alone. It is such a quaint, cozy, authentic Italian restaurant. On top of that, the food and staff were amazing. We got the chicken carbonara and grilled chicken Marsala. They are known to give out some surprising free stuff here and there - the salad and the dessert. Definitely recommend and definitely will be coming back!What a great experience.> There's no sign on the door. It's one of those restaurants where if you know, you know. The owner is one of the most genuine people I've ever met.And the food? My god. Amazing.

Earlier that day, I was giving a talk to the bright minds of MIT students at one of their conferences - on Innovation. I'm pretty good at speaking in public if I may say so myself. But I'm not good at waiting in line at a restaurant. Luckily for me, the 1 hour wait turned to be only 30 minutes or so because it's easier to seat one person, and I got lucked out. A word of advice. Don't be showing up at 5:30 PM on a Saturday in a winter evening if patience is not your virtue, it's not mine, neither is enduring cold New England winter evening. I squeezed inside and did some work while waited. When my name was called up much earlier than I thought, I had expected attitudinal wait staff per the prior yelp post. Not at all. Super friendly staff. Very accommodating and excellent service. Everyone seems to be suggesting the same dishes. Skate cheek, oysters, and fish carpaccio. But what really made me happy was the cool looking cocktails. Mine had a smoky bubble. The popping of the bubble was fun with that Hawaiian flower. Tiki bars need to take notes. Oysters were excellent. So was the carpaccio. Light. The skate cheek felt very meaty and definitely something you don't see very often. Finally I had to do it. The fried clams. What an excellent add. Though I was super full and I had one bite. I packed the rest of the clams to go - figure I'd work out before I consumed some more later that evening.Quite surprisingly, there were approx. 30% of Asians dining there when I was there, which I found a bit curious. I had expected the ratio to be a lot lower, but if you are an Asian and reading this, well, you should definitely go because Asians in general tend to appreciate good seafood (see I can stereotype too and I often to), and this must be way better than the average for it to attract so many of us.I would definitely ask the bartender to suggest a cocktail instead of trying to figure out what to drink. And if you don't know what to order, just ask. The friendly servers will tell you exactly what to get, and all you had to do was to say ""Okay, I'll get that.""He just arrived in Boston tonight for work. When he called I said, ""Hey are you going to Saltie Girl? You should get the cocktails.""> Food is solid. Service is meh. Customers with large high ends branded items should at least be offered to store their items somewhere more reputable or, at very least, by some one with better common sense; I'm opposed to simply placed it right in front of the bathroom when every toilet users just have to kick on it. And no. We're not talking lack of space. There's a huge space that can stored our branded purchase easily. But the hostess chose not to do so, or lacked the common sense thereof as the case may be. A bit common sense can get you a long way. Try getting accustomed to the modern day mode of making reservations. It's modern practices and though your business is doing well from passerbys, it's be good to invest in long term customers.> I have mixed feelings about my experience. Everything was good but felt overpriced which makes expectations higher. I went at 5:00pm and was seated immediately. To start, we had the radicchio and endive salad, bread, and crab roll. The bread was very good and served warm. I could have eaten the basket myself!  The salad was a satisfactory salad- we enjoyed it. The crab rolls were very spicy and I don't like spice so that was a bad order for me. However, the size vs price was out of whack.For my entree I got the lobster roll. I've only had one other in my life so I'm not the best judge here but I found some pieces particularly chewy. It still was enjoyable but I wouldn't order it again. The chips that came with it are served cold in a bag and I thought they were a weak counterpart. Cape cod chips are crunchier and better in my opinion. We ordered french fries too and I think they would have been better paired with the roll than the chips. They were salty and flavorful. Would I go back?

Sat at the bar and ordered two of their NOLA inspired cocktails. We ended up splitting the BBQ shrimp, crawfish & Tasso fritters, fried oysters and the red beans & rice. All were good. Personally, the oysters were my favorite. They were fresh and crisp. Prices were very reasonable for the neighborhood. Service was attentive and the restaurant was clean. We'll be back the next time we're craving a taste of New Orleans.> I was very excited about this place opening but left disappointed unfortunately. First, we almost past by this place. The frosty effect on the doors make it seem like its still shut down and the banner sign doesn't stand out enough to ground attention. Our service was extremely slow and very unattentive. We went on a Saturday afternoon and were 1 of 3 tables in the whole restaurant, so you would think we would have seen our server more than 2 times...nope. Our order was put in incorrectly, took forever to be corrected, no check ins in between, and then the ""corrected"" food was still wrong. The food itself was subpar. I ordered the fried oyster poboy which was too greasy, luke warm, and had barely any spicy mayo on it. My fiance ordered the muffaletta which was nothing more than a basic deli sandwich with added olives (yes we knew what it was before ordering it). The crawfish and lasso fritters were okay, but consisted mainly of batter. There is another eview that mentioned a lack of actual cajun spice in the food and I full on agree just with the limit (and very basic) items we ordered. I wanted to be blown away with flavor and sadly was left looking for it in store bought cocktail sauce.  Unsure if we'll go back again.> J U S T  G O! Im from the Alabama, trust me. Why trust me, I come form the second largest state for obesity, and do you know why we eat so much food? Because it's so got darn good...So, I've lived in Boston for about 7 months now, and have been consistently let down by beantown's ""southern"" food, but there some bangers such as, milkweed.

Well no more quotations b/c I've found the jackpot, and it's full of traditional Cajun dishes and tastefully crafted cocktails. I don't have to tell you how good my food was just go try it, your taste buds will thank you later. However, the taste of the sauce on the crab cakes made my soul leave for a second...good God, it was so good. Side-note: I got the pickled green beans and they were cold, which I didn't like but I'm sure someone will, just not me.> The ambiance gave it a Bourbon Street vibe. I ordered fried oysters and shrimp + grits ($38). The food was delicious, portions were filling and the drinks were strong. The friendly staff enhanced our experience. No complaints, not overpriced.

Null,"Cocktail Bars, Comfort Food",Yes,Null,Null,Null,Null,$$ ,Yes,Stillwater,Null,"5, 3, 4, 5, 5","Overwhelmingly surprised by this place.  It's a long and narrow restaurant and bar.  At the entrance, the modern-chic bar is what greets you immediately following the host(ess) station.  Walking through the somewhat crowded bar, you pass stools with a long table overlooking the kitchen staff, into the dining area.  I like how it's set back from the hustle and bustle of the bar area.  I was very pleased that the tables weren't crammed in there atop each other, like many other restaurant/bars in the downtown area.  We were seated at a half-booth table, with plenty of room from our immediate neighbors.  Our waitress came over promptly to share evening specials, and pour water. We started with the biscuits and butter, with baked in blue cheese, as well as the smoked chicken empanaditas.  While $8 for biscuits seems a little pricey, these were worth it.  The biscuits were warm, with tasty blue cheese, and delicious butter.  The empanaditas were good.  For main courses, my wife ordered the pulled pork & slaw sandwich, I ordered the ricotta dumplings with mushrooms.  The sandwich was piled high, both with pork and fries, the meat was perfectly tender & flavorful.  The dumplings were great, almost like gnocchi, but even more soft/plump/tender.  The mushroom & cream sauce was spot on. 10/10 would order this again.  We saw a few desserts in passing, but nothing jumped out at us.  They had a special pre-fix menu that had assorted pastries that looked delectable; we asked our waitress if it was possible to order that, but were told it was only available with the pre-fix menu.  Mixed drink prices were on par for Boston (~$14 each).  We thoroughly enjoyed every dish.  We liked the upscale casual atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Trying to find the place may be a bit challenging, as it's at the intersection of several one-way streets just on the outskirts of Chinatown, with limited street parking.  But seek them out and enjoy a wonderful meal.> Nice experience, I had steak Pita, it says Blu, as in blue cheese, but it is light on the liquid like dressing, I put my wife horseradish slaw she didn't want on it and it made the sandwich a solid 3.5.Wife had Turkey - Rach- coleslaw on side- she love it, solid 4.3.Easy walk from South station (5 min) would go back.By the way- you pass Tate on the way, another good spot, but I liked Stillwater a bit more better.> Stillwater knows what brunchers want: visual plates and drinks that'll bring out your mean girl Gretchen when ordering and consuming. Case in point: there's a rotating menu special called Chefy's Panks that I will eternally roast for name and name alone. (Side note: on our trip, they were Reese's Cup pancakes with the candies, uh, griddled inside and the cakes drizzled with chocolate and sweetened peanut butter syrups. Cool, whatever,)I like their soles pulled pork, and I loved the construction of the 421 (ha, weed humor) - a cast iron amalgamation of poached eggs, spiced potatoes, said pork and some wild west hollandaise I know they made for the menfolk. How can I be so sure? Only one guy at our ten top didn't get it. They're smart, the Stillwater folk are. Cary Mary is a dope, Trumpian spin on the bloody and not for any other reason than it's orange. No tomato, just the carrot juice, along with a house spice blend and a sweet skewer of bacon and pickles. Get an order of the biscuits, too. The rasher bits are palpable. Nothing was bad, although some plates and cocktails fared better than others and our server was very absent. We though to may have been because of the auto tip on a party of six or more, but when we got the check, it wasn't added. So, gain attention however you see fit.Secret street parking along the entrance and a sizable footprint for brunch crowds, add Still water to the short list.> This place is out of control. Deliciousness? Out of control. Portion size? Out of control. Niceness of staff? Out of control. Inventive cocktail selection? Out of control. The only thing that wasn't out of control was the pricing :)Everything we tried was excellent. The smoked buffalo chicken wings are some of the best I've had. We couldn't stop eating the pulled pork mac n' cheese. The ritz chicken was fabulous and those mashed potatoes, yeah. The cucumber melon salad was bright and fresh -- it reminded me of a similar Vietnamese or Thai salad. The pomodoro was good, although not quite as good as the other dishes (adding some red pepper flakes made a big difference). We were also fans of the cocktail menu, which had some fun twists.Super convenient walking and T location near South Station, Downtown Crossing, and Chinatown; parking can be a bit tough though. An excellent upgrade from Townsman!> I heard about the Ricotta dumplings so I came for the ricotta dumplings! There were excellent, the sauce was especially great. I also ordered the biscuits to start which were very good. The blue cheese is a little unusual but that's why I ordered them. Since I don't eat chicken, I opted to go sans chicken drippings butter. I'm sure it tastes great, but just not for me. I used the biscuits to soak up the extra sauce from the dumplings...culinary power move.",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null
Null,"Tapas Bars, Spanish, Cocktail Bars",Yes,Null,Null,Null,Null,$$$ ,No,Toro,Null,"5, 3, 2, 4, 4","This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.Only reason I'm giving the place a 4 star is because they have changed their drink menu, and honestly almost all of their new drinks suck! They all taste like medication! But food is still great, every single restaurant has it's off days - though I've had a good solid experience here, their chefs are super moody on how they present the same dish on different nights. You'll see: Here's my favorites: -Bone Marrow: Honestly the mood of this dish, depends on the mood of the chef.. sometimes they give you delicious bread with oil on it and toasted sometimes they just give you basic bread. Sometimes it's fully garnished sometimes it's not... & trust me the toasted bread and the fruits make a huge difference! - Shrimp Gambas: This dish has never failed me! Pure magic! -Corn: Best Mexican corn you will ever have! - and of course the seafood paella: Which the richness of this dish also depends on the mood of chef. But it's usually good.> This restaurant is always packed; however, it's a little easier to get a table after 9:00pm.Pros: The food is pretty good. The grilled octopus, the pig ear  terrine, and the bone marrow are all good.Cons: The paella is also good just a little too salty after a few bites. Our server is not professional enough even though she is really nice. She touched the food with her bare hand when she was trying to adjust the food display. Another thing is the music  is really loud.Overall, the dining experience is still good.> The food here is really good. I love the seafood paella, croquettes, and bone marrow dIshes. But, what I don't understand is why the restaurant has to play such loud music. It's so loud that people are basically screaming at each other and adding to the already loud atmosphere. I felt like I was at a college frat party. Not sure if this is the vibe Toro is going for? This ruined the experience for me.> Love tapas bars so much!! This is my second favorite in the Boston area. The interior is pretty small, so you'll definitely be eating sitting right next to strangers. It also has that dimly lit vibe. For plates, my favorite of the night was the Roasted Bone Marrow. It came with nicely toasted bread and some meat on top to complement. So good! We also loved the Garlic Shrimp. It's super saucy in the best kind of way.  The patatas bravas is also delicious - pillowy with 2 different sauces. Can you tell I love sauce? In terms of meh, the service did seem a little rushed. They often came up to try and take a seemingly empty plate away. Like I still have 2 potatoes left; please chill I'll eat them eventually... I also didn't love the $16 fancy taco lol. I wish there was a neutral carb item wrapping all the fancy things together. Instead, it was just a bunch of expensive things slapped together aesthetically. The mulled one was also average. Not enough spice flavor and also not sweet enough. Kind of just tasted like hot wine tbh. Should have gone for the sangria.> I've been to Toro a number of times at this point and it never disappoints. Only 4 stars because of minor inconsistencies as their chefs rotate. Their menu is relatively small but everything is so delicious I don't mind ordering the same usuals items every time. It's almost always busy, but you can put in your name and leave your phone number so you can wander while you wait for a text. They give you a 10 minute warning so stay close! There's a nice park down the street in the warmer weather, or you can find a spot at the bar when it's cold. Our go to's are the paella, bone marrow, and street corn- MUST try!Salt cod croquettes- wonderful texture and love the aioli, but you lose the flavor of the fishGrilled corn- simply amazing. Generous with all of the fixings and cooked to perfection. Aside from Eloti (which literally only serves street corn), this is the best in townStuffed piquillo peppers- the peppers themselves are yummy, but the oil it comes in really makes the dish. Black olive honey in a beautiful olive oil, plus it comes with bread so you can sop of every last bitBone marrow- also a show stopper. The bone marrow is always rich with tender oxtail. Perfectly balanced with citrus to cut the richness and cleanse the palate. I love the crusty bread it comes with and (depending on the chef) will be wonderfully toasted and full of butter and garlicPaella valenciana- it takes a while to come out, so it's usually the last thing you eat. It's on the more expensive side, but even the half portion is very generous and packed full with seafood and meat. The rice is perfectly cooked- just enough chew left- and the flavors are amazing. It comes out piping hot, and if you like the rice at the bottom crispy, you can leave it for a bit and then scrape it up; if not be sure to keep it stirred!Churros- they only offer one dessert, and I'm not sure it's worth it- I'd personally much rather have another dinner plate. They're well done on the outside and have a pretty soft center, but they're so crispy they tend to fall apart.

The food was good but the customer service was horrible. THIS time, my friend really wanted to celebrate at Barcelona, so I gave it another shot. Before I asked for Bella, I wanted to observe first. Upon arrival, we were greeted with friendly hostesses. My friend made a reservation for 2 people when it should have been 3 but the hostess was very professional and nice about it and seated us in less than 3 minutes. No, this was not a special treatment because the reservation was made under a different name. Once seated, our waitress Marla, came over almost immediately with water and explained the menu with enthusiasm (unlike the first time where the waitress was annoyed). Marla also came to the table every time our water glass was nearly done. For a booked evening, I was very impressed that Marla was so attentive to all the tables she waited, making sure that the needs of the customers are met while eyeballing the glasses on the table, and taking action. Top notch! The food came out relatively quickly despite a very booked evening! Each dish was intricately made with impressive sauces to accompany it. The only thing that I didn't really like was the paella. The first and second time had the same issue, it was quite burnt on the bottom. My friends and I love paella so we order this every time but we all agreed that it wasn't the best. I asked for Bella and she came out to chat with us. She was super nice and friendly. Like someone with the utmost customer service, she thanked us for coming back and checked on us to see how things were. I'm glad I came back to Barcelona. Their dishes are yummy and customer service was professional and great! Thank you for the warmest Barcelonian hospitality!> Ambiance:  - It was definitely busy! As you would expect from how quickly their reservations go. - However, despite all the tables being full, the noise level was ideal, an underratedly very important aspect of a restaurant. Loud enough to feel fun, but quiet enough to have companion/date/friend/relative/enemy. - The decoration is rustic and Spanish themed yet they were playing electronic and dance music. Odd combination! Drink: - They have an extensive, if not overwhelming, wine list with several moderately priced bottles. If you order a glass, you also get a choice of two different sizes.  - The cocktails looked good and were surprisingly cheap. None of the flavors particularly stood out to me. And with Boston's all star drink culture, I've seen better. Food: - I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of tapas or small plates. When I'm hungry, I feel much more satisfied after eating an entire plate. However, I enjoyed everything we ordered. My boyfriend and I ordered: the spicy eggplant caponata; the tortilla; the hanger steak; the empanadas; and the shishisto peppers. And the free bread is so good. Our favorite tapas were the EGGPLANT, the TORTILLA, and the SHISHISTO PEPPERS.  - We also ordered dessert, the flourless chocolate cake. It was a circular cake with a warm molten, chocolate interior and crunchy almonds on top. What more can you ask for! Service: - Fine. Could've been more attentive, but we were never struggling to get their attention. Good for: Dates, Girls night Out; Drinks and Apps> I previously gave Barcelona's a glowing review a few years ago. It used to be my go-to in Boston during the PAX East convention each spring. We used to easily be able to get in without long prior reservations and it was always a great experience with top-notch food, great service, and lovely ambiance. Last year we tried and could not get in any day of the long weekend, even though our group was pretty small. I chalked it up to being more popular and vowed to make reservation for 2020. This year my assistant and I both tried to book for a larger group about three months out. It literally took about 15 phone calls and then we were offered either a full room buy-out or a very small group very early or very late in the evening as our only options. And that seemed to be the offering pretty much every day of the week and weekend. Rather than bringing a group of 16 international dignitaries from the Brazilian embassy with us, I opted for a small team dinner of my 4-person leadership team, and took my Brazilian partners to a lovely Italian place (which had no issue seating us or delivering an amazing food experience that all participants loved). Upon arrival at Barcelona's, we waited about 15 to 20 minutes past our reservation time. During the prolonged wait, I attempted to address the difficulty in getting reservations with the host and hostess, to try and figure out if there was a better way. I couldn't have felt more like I was annoying them, with really no practical answer. If I understood correctly, they simply can no longer accommodate mid-sized groups of 5-15 people unless it's very early or very late in the evening, or you're willing to buy out a room with a $1-2K minimum consumption guarantee. Finally, we were seated at a very small table that fit the four of us -- but barely. There was just about enough space for two tapas at the table at one time, so their relatively slow and spaced out arrival might have been by design (or vice versa). Our waiter was attentive but rushed, and everything felt very hurried. Food and drink started coming out fairly quickly, but then we received one dish we hadn't ordered, while another was apparently given to another table and had to be remade. This took about 15-20 minutes. We then waited for at least 20-30 minutes for a single order of paella to share. The waiter brought out two free tapas while we were waiting, apologizing each time for the delay. We actually declined the second. At this point, we all were full and really didn't want the paella anymore. I asked if we could just cancel the paella and call it a night. The waiter insisted on checking on the paella and five minutes later it came out. As anticipated, we all tried it, but most of it was left uneaten, which is a shame.Barcelona's still offers some of my favorite food in Boston (although having visited Barcelona in Spain last fall, I've had equal and better tapas there). However, the service was chaotic, the atmosphere feels as if this once amazing restaurant is now too busy to offer the previous standout service, with a very loud main area supper-club feeling and a smaller private table area. Bundled with how difficult it now is to actually make reservations, we'll look to some of the other great food destinations in Boston, including the amazing Italian food in the North End, for celebrating with our clients and partners when in town.> This is the last time I'll ever eat at a Barcelona establishment. My husband brought me here for my birthday and it was hands down the worst dining experience we have ever had. I'm a restaurant manager and he is a chef, both in downtown Boston, we know proper food quality and service and this place was below subpar. Our server forgot about us after we got our first round of tapas. We continued to order three more times and all we heard was excuses that the kitchen messed up or it was someone else fault.... It was clearly the servers fault. Everytime we asked a question on the menu he didnt know the answer and just read the menu back to us.... Gee thanks.Our first two tapas were bland and nothing special. Hoping the food would get better but it got worse and we had to send back a steak dish. We kept waiting for food that obviously never got rung in so we just got the check and decided to leave. There was no way this experience was worth the $200 tab. The server took our credit card and right after we flagged the manager down who was helping us before with wine. We expressed how bad the experience was and she was accommodating and took care of the food on the tab. Meanwhile the server rushed over to try to grab the original check off of the table to close the bill.... another no no and petpeve of mine. We weren't even done with out drink yet and he was rushing for the check....The only positive thing about coming here was the managers responsiveness and the custom menu for gluten and dairy free items. Too bad it took over 10 minutes for me to get a menu back to order food.Sad to see such poor quality all around here. Will definitely be going to Toro next time.> I came here with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. Definitely make a reservation ahead of time. This place will be PACKED especially on the weekend.General impression: This is the third time I've been to Barcelona. It's full of people mostly in 20s -30s. On Saturday night it gets really loud. You have to shout a little bit to talk, which worked out fine for our group of 4. Very nicely decorated; eclectic space. The food: Specialty in tapas or small shared plates, which makes it ideal for a small group. You can also get larger entrees to share, which will take a while to cook (we were told 45 min for seafood paella), and charcuterie (meats, cheese). We opted for the tapas. Favorites: Lobster risotto - the lobster was so TENDER, and risotto flavorful. You get thumb-sized chunks of lobster. It is a small portion but worth the taste for me Crispy rice - very unique as well. Again small portion shape of a short column, maybe the size of your palm and less than an inch in height. The TRUFFLES and sauce make this dish. Thin thin crispy outside layer, but most of the dish is risotto consistency Blistered shishito peppers - a surprising welcome in the meal. Slight heat but kind of just refreshing Churros with chocolate sauce - THICK airy churros, full of maybe cinnamon sugar, to dip in chocolate sauce. Very sharable THE BREAD: one of the best complimentary bread we've ever had. Warm and fluffy on the inside, crispy outside, thick, and slight sourdough feel. Just wonderful to dip in their olive oil. Good, but probably would not get again: Jamón & manchego croquetas - small, 4 pieces. Nothing extraordinary Albondigas - meatballs, also not unique Chorizo with sweet & sour figs - I liked the sweet figs better than the chorizo, which was too hard/dryMussels al Diablo - you get surprising amount of mussels. I generally just prefer white instead of red sauce. Thin chorizo again pretty dense Service: Very friendly, attentive, and prompt. No complaints. Cost: Bit on the pricy side. You're of course paying for the atmosphere as well. For 8 tapas it came out to $~90 for our group of 4 pre tip. Good choice for a nice night out with friends. Tl;dr: Great experience and food.

We had some of the apps and loved them so much that we wanted the full experience. We had to wait 30 minutes or so on a Thursday night but they had pretty fast turnover.This place is dimly-lit and loud but smells amazing from all the food you're surrounded by. If the idea of Asian Fusion Bar Food sounds good to you (like it does to me), then this is the place for you. I think I could have ordered every single thing on the menu but here is what we got:Wu-Tang Tiger Style Ribs - fall of the bone, sticky, sweet, and spicy. These are a must-getKimchi Fried Rice - can't go wrong with fried rice and kimchiKorean Steak Tartar - a delicious tartar with these chewy yet crunchy scallion pancakes to scoop them up withGrilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwich - a little difficult to share but it's stacked high with moist chicken thighs and covered in a fried peanut aioli.

We ordered the Duck Fat Fries and a cold brew Vodka tea. Both were decent and for a person who does not really drink, the cold Vodka tea was delicious. I just thought the service could have been better.

Like more than a year, but just never really found the time for it. So, when my girlfriend wanted to do something food-related around Valentine's day (which is honestly my favorite type of activity), Buttermilk & Bourbon seemed like a great place to go. Still had to book a brunch reservation like 2 weeks in advance though.This place is on the pricier side as a whole. That being said, their tartare toast was amazing. The bread was charred just the right amount and so flavorful and the tartare was fantastic. We also got the spicy nashville fried chicken, mussels, and shrimp and grits. The mussels were good, but not overly amazing, and the shrimp and grits seemed a little watery. That being said I don't have extensive experience with shrimp and grits. The fried chicken, which I had been most looking forward to (due to the many instagram posts I've seen) was disappointing. It wasn't particularly spicy or flavorful, and I wasn't a huge fan of the breading. The chili oil also made it pretty soggy and meh.The beignets deserve a section of their own for this review. Oh my lord they were amazing. The star is this vanilla bean paste/butter-y sort of thing, which the menu doesn't tell you they have. That's why we ordered a chocolate sauce to go with it too, which was good on it's own but ended up mostly untouched in favor of the vanilla. The beignets themselves were warm and fluffy and a great finish to the meal.In summary, not a bad experience even with the pricier menu. A lot of places don't live up to self-hyping over an extended period of time, but I genuinely enjoyed the tartare and beignets while the mussels were about as good as I would expect. They made up for the less stellar chicken and grits, though we would definitely explore other items on their menu.> The food was very good on this visit. I've dined here before and has been pretty hit or miss. The Corn was the best of the meal. The biscuits and wings I felt tasted a bit too dry but the sauce and butter that came with it certainly improved the taste and texture.The service was less than average however. Our server was friendly but not too attentive we had to ask for the same things over and over again as well as the foods came at very delayed times. This is a very good spot to impress some friends. I would return.> Dishes just aren't worth it for what they're charging. We got the biscuits, fried chicken, beef stew (or whatever it's called) and some drinks. First off, the aesthetic on the inside was very cool and modern. A little loud but that's what you'd expect. Our waiter seemed impatient, almost profiling my girlfriend and I for being younger and not as important as his other tables.The drinks were fine, nothing mind-blowing but it's a nicer bar in Boston, you know? The food is where we decided we're not coming back. I kid you not, the stew was only about 5 spoonfuls of food. I get that it's tapas, but when you're charging as much as restaurants charge for full meals, you'd think it's be more substantial. The fried chicken was fine, but tasted a bit metallic, hard to explain. The biscuits were the only thing u deemed worth it, as there were enough of them and they were bit enough that you could justify the costs of it. The aesthetic and the drinks are enough to make me give it another chance, maybe for the brunch menu (if they have that?).> After reading several Yelp reviews, I was excited to give this place a try. I came here with my boyfriend and neither of us thought it was good. We ordered the new orleans style street corn ($9), sweet and spicy buttermilk fried chicken ($11) and aged gouda mac & cheese ($14). The corn was stacked on top of one another and was not individually dipped in spicy garlic mayo. Instead, the chef drips the sauce from the top leaving little to no sauce for the two corn on the bottom of the pyramid. We asked for more sauce for the bottom two corn, but the server refused and said the sauce is made per order. As the menu states ""sweet and spicy fried chicken"", it was neither sweet or spicy, they were soggy and wet. The mac & cheese was described as ""pork scraps, red hot cheeto crust, fresh chives"" -- there were no hot cheeto crust. We asked the server if this was the correct order and she informed us that the host provided us with the wrong menus as they change their menus throughout the year.> The food here is fantastic. We truly enjoyed the entire experience. The service was great, the food was great, and the drinks were great. The chicken was crispy and the biscuits were fluffy. The grits were too notch, I was a bit apprehensive at first but I am so glad I ordered them. Top 5 best I have ever had for sure.

A friend suggested we go to north end for some good food and good food we certainly did find. In fact, incredible food! Our wait time: There was about a 30 minute wait to be seated but entirely worth the wait. This is a very small restaurant so don't expect to be seated immediately. The kitchen takes up half the space! The food: We ordered Aglio Olio (the squid ink pasta with olive oil, calamari, and garlic) as well as the Monkfish Marsala. Both dishes were delicious and absolutely a must order. The monkfish Marsala was some of the best fish I've ever ordered. My husband and I couldn't get enough of that dish. I highly recommend it. The portion sizes: My husband and I ordered the entree portions of both aforementioned meals, had the bread to start, and had gotten the salad instead of the pasta that comes with the fish. We were both full but didn't have to worry about taking food home as we finished our meals and nearly licked our plates clean then and there. The service: Great! They were friendly, quick, and helpful with our questions about the menu. They even split our salad for us without us having to ask which was great foresight on our servers end. This restaurant is worth the wait! I also suggest dropping by Mike's after you finish your meal if you still have room for dessert.> One of my fav spots in NE.  Limited seating, small  tables, fast service.  If there s a line outside, it ll go quickly.  My fav dish there is the Black Pasta w Putenesca sauce.  They serve it right out of the pan.> I literally planned a trip to Boston because the fra divolo pasta in Strictly Dumpling's video looked so amazing so The Daily Catch was a must go. We came around 7:30 pm and we had to wait an hour not because there were a lot of people in line but because the space is so small and there are only 3 people running the entire thing - a chef, a dishwasher, and a waiter/front of house.The table arrangement sucked because my boyfriend and I had to sit with another couple but it was only ok since they were so nice. We ordered the fra divolo for 2 and a full order of the squid ink pasta with ground calamari. The squid ink pasta is a must get - so delicious and a pretty unique dish. The fra divolo actually disappointed me a bit because I wanted the tomato-y sauce to be thicker or chunkier or to have more flavor/spice. Just a little more umph and it would've been perfect with the pasta and seafood. Maybe I should've been like Mike and brought some of my own chili oil.> The first time I came here, I waited 1:30 hr in the freezing cold for a table... and it was totally worth it for the ink pasta! This time around we got lucky with everyone being afraid to be out because of the coronavirus. No wait and the food was just as fabulous! For any foodie visiting Boston, this place is a MUST! Last time we came we tried more of their menu, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!> Is this place worth all the hype? YES! Absolutely! This is a no frills, cash only, very small restaurant, but the food is wonderful. I highly recommend the black squid ink pasta with aglio olio sauce and fried calamari. The pasta was one of the best dishes I've had in a while. This place clearly knows how to prepare pasta and seafood and everything is super fresh.

They have a number of their regular menu items for a fraction of the price! I got the brunch burger and it was delicious. I love the potatoes that come with it. It can get super packed so you might have to wait  a bit, especially during the summer. Waiting is easy, you can put your name and number and just walk  about the Pru while waiting to be contacted that your table is ready.> My first time heading into Earls and you feel almost like in a dream walking up the stairs towards the main dining and bar area.I really enjoyed the wide variety of food choices...I never thought i'd be able to get bipimbap in the same place as a s'mores cheesecake. The Black Tea Peach Sour was just the right kick of whiskey and bitters.> Previously, my husband had experienced wonderful service and meals at The Earls Assembly  Row location and was very disappointed with evening as was a  special occasion that we coming to town, and staying  overnight to attend the ballet.My steak was smeared with a salty sauce that was called ""peppercorn,"" and was prepared well done, rather than the medium I requested. It was my understanding that the peppercorn was more of an accented taste rather than it being soaked. It ruined the steak, and my husband then split his steak with me.  Our server was nowhere to be found to explain the situation.Eventually, we reported to our server my displeasure with my meal + she responded to let me know if I wanted anything else from the kitchen. I did not, as my husband split his steak with me and we were on a tight schedule, as we were headed to the ballet that evening. My husband also ordered a beer after our appetizer was served and it did not arrive until we were done with our meal.  Both the steak + beer went to waste as we had to make the ballet in time. Both, our server and the manager knew we were on a tight schedule, as they asked if we were celebrating anything. Husband and I were very surprised  + very disappointed to see that neither the beer or my steak was deducted from our bill and we ended up paying $160 ($131 + tip)  for one entrée, one app, one glass of Prosecco, and one beer. Unfortunately we did not have time to dispute this as we needed to leave and didn't want any more of a damper on our evening. We won't be returning. I left a message with the manager and they have yet to respond.> This spot is located inside Prudential Center. The restaurant was large, with plenty of seating. They had a bar up front near the entrance, and another bar in the back with several TV screens for sports fans. A bad thing about a restaurant on a slow evening is that the service can also be slow... It took a good while for a server to come over to our table with their menu. We decided to order a small items to share. First item was Korean Hot Wings. I really like Korean wings, and they have done a great job here! They were tangy with a nice little kick, packed with flavor! Second dish was Truffle Fries. The fresh ground pepper was really nice. The fries were thin, soft and potato-y, soooo good! Third dish was Dragon Roll. The rice was undercooked or dry, causing them to be a bit tough, which was disappointing. We also ordered one entrée item to share. We chose Scallop Risotto. The kitchen staffs separated the risotto into two plates for us without us asking for it. How nice! Scallops were huge, plump, and tasty, nice dish! We had Sticky Toffee Chocolate Pudding for dessert. Toffee was warm/hot in the center, nice size, moist and dense. Ice cream was perfect with it. Candy snap was way too hard. Not really edible which was disappointing... We had a nice dinner here. There were few negatives, such as the service being very slow, and the temperature of the restaurant was too warm to the point it was kind of hot and uncomfortable. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves at a roomy and comfy booth. I don't think I will order the sushi again, but everything else was quite good.> I was hanging out in the Prudential Center walking around, when my boyfriend asked if I want to get a drink. I was surprised when Earls kitchen within the Pru went all the way up three floors to a rooftop bar. There is outdoor seating in the warmer fall, summer and spring, and indoor covered rooftop access during the winter. Also, there's always the drink of the month for six dollars, so I had a margarita and it came out great. He had the espresso martini with real espresso. We loved the vibe in the area. It gets extremely crowded so come early and snag a bar seat or wear comfortable shoes for standing! Well done Earls",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Location is great, easily walkable from the Northeastern campus and close to Back Bay. The wait grows pretty fast during peak dinner hours, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.This is the best bang for your buck, Thai food that I've ever had. I've come here over at least 100 times by now.The main dishes I would recommend are the pad thai or pad seew with crispy chicken, pho dac biet. The noodles are super delicious and the portion sizes are huge. The crispy chicken is very juicy and crispy. The pho dac biet has one of the best pho broths I've ever tasted. It also comes with a generous amount of meat and noodles. Either of these won't disappoint!If your in Boston and your ever feeling authentic Thai food, this is the spot.Also get the thai iced tea. It's a great addition to your meal.> I love far. I also love it when restaurants give a lot of noodles! They they gave me a ton of noodles which made me really happy. The thing that really made me unhappy was that I paid $6 for 4 tiny crispy eggrolls. In the picture on the menu, there are 6! So, to pay $2 each for a tiny fried egg roll just made me so upset. They also could have given a few more pieces of crabmeat and at least one more shrimp. Especially since I didn't get calamari. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.> Above average spot. It's extremely convenient for me as far as location goes so I think that's how I know I'll be back but nothing here had me drooling.Very generous portions and the restaurant inside is clean. They have average ingredients which make for a consistently average tasting food but it's good enough to go back for.Very casual college-feeling atmosphere if you want to stop in for a quick bite to eat. They are quick to get you food and to turn tables so I've never had to wait long. From now on I'll probably get take-out just because of the location. An important thing to keep in mind, especially if you're not familiar with the area, for either dining in or taking out, is that parking around this area is tough unless you want to pay and arm and a leg to park at the Prudential garages and walk a block or two.> LOVEDDD the pad thai! Got it to go, it was a huge portion. It was also super super tasty. I think this is my favorite  pad thai I've had in boston so far. Would def get it again, great deal.> Great food for a decent price. I don't eat beef so have not tried any of the beef based pho's, but the Tom yum is my favorite. It is savory, sweet, spicy and tangy all in one. Def my go to! This is one of the only places I have found Tom yum fried rice. It was pretty yummy. My one complaint is the portion size of the Tom yum soup alone. I ordered the one with shrimp and there was literally one small shrimp in the soup. I think they should add more or put two sizes on the menu for those seeking a little more then just broth. Service here is always friendly. It is located on Mass Ave, so I like sitting by the windows and people watching. All in all, decent pho place in Boston!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

The menu has such a wide selection of udon, rice dishes, and sides, so I pretty much wanted to try everything on the menu. I eventually landed on the wagyu udon with truffle dashi, which was so fragrant and delicious. The portion was truly massive, so I'd say the steeper prices are totally justified. On top of that, the service was amazing - my server took the time to run through the entire menu with us and was super attentive throughout our meal. The mood lighting and cozy feel really added to the ambiance and make this a great date spot as well.> 3 stars... Because one order is good and another is ... Rediculous. First order of Sukiyaki was full of meaty goodness, packed with great flavor. The second one... Curry udon with a single piece of small beef the size of a pinky nail, like serious. A single. Piece. Of. Beef. Not to mention, the beef was dry and tough, and I only live 2 minutes away. Overall my girlfriend enjoyed the meal... But I didn't, since the curry udon was my order. But at least the curry taste ok. Still overpriced for the quality.Update: they forgot the egg in the Sukiyaki udon. Lowered to 2 stars.> I heard from friends that Tsurutontan is opening a new location Boston aside from NY, so decided to check it out and it was pretty satisfying. There can be a few improvements, but it can slide since they only opeNed recently. I called for a reservation at noon for a evening dinner, but there reservation is full so we decided to walk in. We waited near the bar for more than 30 mins before being called. The waiting space isn't too big so it can get hot quickly. Good thing they have a coat check. The drinks we ordered at the bar while waiting (Tokyo Mule) is too sweet and lack alcoholic content. Would like to see them do better there. Once we were sat, the service was on point. He carefully explained the types of noodles, how it was made fresh in house daily, how regular and double size cost the same and his recommendations. We ordered the lamb chop for appetizer for 4 people, My friends and I ended up getting the wagyu udon with truffle and dashi, another got the wagyu sukiyaki with egg. It was very delicious and I slurped and drank all the soup. Overall it only came out to 35 dollars a person which isn't bad at all.To have the best experience, make sure to reserve ahhh and avoid the waiting. Maybe stay away from the cocktails for now and ordeR the wagyu udon it's a must try.> A solid udon place! I ordered the stir fry udon and it was a little oily but tasty. We also ordered a curry udon and another udon soup, which everyone enjoyed. They have the option for thin or thick cut udon and we all opted for thick cut udon. They also have the option for regular or large size for the same price! Large would just have more udon and soup, not more of the dish ingredients. Of course we had to all order large for the leftovers! The atmosphere was also very comfortable and modern. They have the two floors of seating and both are decorated nicely. Would return again!> Boston finally getting some more NYC restaurants!! This one definitely did not disappoint.*Try to make an appointment because it usually gets crowded quick during dinner time, and it's not a huge space BUT they do have bar seating/roomy waiting area for while you wait*I forgot that you're able to do a size upgrade here for free, which sort of explains their higher price. It's worth it when you get the extra noodles and broth, but if not, the dishes are definitely on the pricier side. I would suggest not to upgrade unless you're REALLY hungry or you'll have so much leftover!For udon dishes, you have the option of choosing thin or thick noodles. I got the UNI UDON which is a great cold noodle dish that comes with plentiful of fresh uni. I got to try some of my friend's broth from the US WAGYU SHABU UDON IN TRUFFLE DASHI and it was fantastic. Honestly think that was a highlight for me, especially with the meat. There's a lot of different options here to fit your tastebuds so I would recommend anyone to come here because it literally has whatever you may be in the mood for!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

I will continue to stop when visiting Boston.Can't stop thinking about that Lobster Roll!> Solid place - great decor, industrial and rustic....I love Fort Point for that.Everyone was nice.  Bar seats were comfortable.  Clean, service oriented, organized.Food was good...above average.   Seasonal oysters were great.  Tuna crudo a bit heavy on the salt.  Fish tacos weren't memorable.Burger w fried oysters - this was outstanding. A surf and turf burger - how novel.  Great flavors, cooked precisely, nice pairing of somewhat different textures.  Among the top 10 burgers I ve ever had.Overall, an enjoyable experience - would recommend for casual night out.> A friend recommended coming here instead of Island Hog and I left the night feeling meh about the decision. We made a reservation and showed up a bit early but ended up being seated 30 minutes before our scheduled time so the service was very on point. The restaurant specializes on fried fish plates, fresh fish entrees, and oysters so I ordered the fish to get a taste of what they're known for. Surprisingly, the burger that my friend ordered was much better than my fish. Unfortunately, a lot of our plates were also extra salty so we actually sent back a couple of them. I never am one to send back but my friend really couldn't handle the salt so felt compelled to ask for a replacement. The server was very accommodating and even gave us some snacks to nibble on as my friend waited for her replacement but it was hard to get rid of the lingering salty feeling. It was still a fun experience and I'd come back but I'd probably get the burger next time...> There really wasn't anything I disliked about this place except for the relatively high prices. All of the seafood was great though. Out of all of the great stuff we ordered, I liked the calamari and the delicious seared fish the best. The calamari was delicious, especially in the orange dipping sauce (I have no idea what was in it) and the fish was cooked perfectly for my standards. It wasn't dry or hard at all, but moist, easy to chew, and flavorful. I almost forgot to mention the decent service we received too. After all of this said, if you're willing to spend a bit more on a meal, then come check this place out!> This is 100% my favorite stop in Boston! Possibly my favorite on the east coast?! The food is always fresh and well seasoned without being overly rich. I could honestly just come and order 5 tuna crudos (black garlic aioli is worthy of a poetry tribute) but the talented staff always helps me put together a meal that's far better than that! My most recent visit we had Gabe as our server and he helped us decide on a bunch of share plates instead of getting entrees (in my opinion this is THE MOVE at the restaurant too many good raw bar options and apps!) We went with the tuna crudo, salmon poke, brussels sprouts, fried calamari, scallop ceviche and some oysters topped w caviar because...why not add the caviar! As always the tuna was a total stand out and the scallop ceviche was a surprise second, plantain chips...I never knew I was such a fan! The pieces of apple in the ceviche are super refreshing and crisp, I ended up dipping calamari in the left over ceviche juice because it was too good to let it go!! My friend loved the brussels sprouts and was still raving about them the next morning. The calamari was seasoned well but compared to everything else, it was just....fine. That togarashi aioli tho, so good, there's someone on staff that knows their way around an aioli for sure. Gabe helped my friend pick a wine that she loved and helped me get my hands on my favorite beer, Orval, even though the computer said they were out of it. Truly saved the dayyy. We had the apple crisp for dessert and it was just ok, I'd probably skip it next time in favor of one more beer from their extensive list. You do need a reservation pretty much any night of the week to be sat in a timely fashion. We came in a little early hoping to slide into an open table and the hostess (I think her name was savannah) was super helpful with getting us on the waitlist and letting us know she would give us a text while we got a drink around the corner.

I came on a weekend, so it was pretty packed in here. Expect a wait, but it's definitely worth it. This place is so cute and the menu is pretty fairly priced. My boyfriend and I ordered the seaweed salad and sweet potato tempura for appetizers. The seaweed salad was pretty average but the sweet potato tempura was to die for. Literally so addicting, we couldn't get enough. We got the miso carbonara and curry udon after looking at reviews and they were both BOMB. The udon itself is soooo good and the right texture. The curry udon had a mild spice and a yummy curry broth but personally, I wasn't too much of a fan of the chicken that came with it. Other than that, I have no complaints. I'll definitely be becoming a regular.> Futago is very tasty and their options for udon are simple and fresh. I've been here twice and enjoyed my meals - although it is good, it's not the best I've had. Why I liked it: Everything was so fresh! The noodles are the perfect chewiness and thickness, the vegetables and green onions are refreshing to taste and the broth is not too heavy at all. It's nice and clear unlike many other places where it's too oily or salty. I'd definitely come here again, as it's the perfect portions, good price given the quality of materials, and a great meal for freezing cold Boston weather!Why it could be better: The broth itself is savory but I think it's missing some flavor and that perfect umami taste of udon broth. I had the duck udon; the duck slices were really great in portion and the deliciously distinct duck flavor was also very strong! However, the pieces were way too hard and chewy for me - I had to put each whole slice in my mouth and slowly work through it because I couldn't even bite it in half as it was so chewy. And I was on a date with a very cute boy so I had to look good eating :( I would recommend them to look into their way of cooking the duck or where they source it to figure out why it was so darn tough! Either way, still a great udon joint. Would still recommend!> I am always craving a good bowl of soup udon noodles in the winter and Futago definitely satisfies that craving! This is my go place other than Yume. Not only do they have great udon but also such luxury-feeling napkins. We ordered Tatsuraage to start. It was really juicy and refreshing with the lemon juice drizzle and Japanese mayo based dipping sauce. I decided to try the Spicy Dan Dan Udon and the broth was relatively light with a hint of spiciness and sweetness. In comparison of their other udon flavors this one is not as impressive. The flavor fades really quickly in my mouth. On the other hand, the Niku udon broth tasted like sweet soy and dashi. It was not very heavy but the beef was so well cooked. The noodle texture is pretty standard in my opinion, I personally prefer yume's chewiness. But overall, their broth and unique flavors definitely make it one of my favorite udon places in town. Lastly, personal favourites: sukiyaki, pork and kimchi and curry chicken ;)> Futago udon is kind of out of the way if you dont arent near the green line but it's well worth the trip. It specializes in udon noodles but has so many unique twists and variations including miso carbonara and a curry version.I've been twice. The first time I got the tsukiyaki which is huge in portion and variety of what's in the bowl including beef, tofu, and a soft boiled egg. Broth is delicious but slightly too sweet for my liking. It's very similar to yume ga arukara but pricier and sweeter without tasting as refreshing. It's a very close second though. The second time I got the new dan dan version of the soup. It was delicious. Much more savory with deeper flavors than the tsukiyaki thought not as much variety of items in the bowl, mainly with ground pork. Still an incredible bowl. Friends also got a truffle oil udon (very very truffly. Great but can get overwhelming over time) and the curry version. (Surprisingly good combination of flavors. I'd order it the next time)> I am usually not a fan of udon (particularly the soup-y kind), but this place has won me over with their huge variety of different types of udon that they offer. We had a party of 9, which we called ahead to reserve. Thank goodness we did that because the place got packed really quickly!My friends and I ordered the purple sweet potato tempura, takoyaki, and chicken tatsuta-age for appetizers. The sweet potato tempura was SO delicious. The flavors are subtle and the dish did not feel too heavy. Great way to start off the meal. The takoyaki was nice and full - crunchy and soft just the way I like it. The chicken was very juicy as well. Overall I enjoyed the appetizers that they offered as they all stood out!For my entree, I ordered the miso carbonara. This dish is pretty heavy and the portion is huge! I barely made a dent in it, but I took it home as leftovers and tasted AMAZING the following day as well (huge plus). The flavors were amazing and balanced with huge chunks of bacon (yes!). I enjoyed this very much and I am excited to try the other dishes that they offer.I heard from my friends that their bowls of soupy udon were somewhat bland, so I will probably stray away from that. I love dishes that are exciting and unique, which they offer here.Parking was extremely easy to find.

All I can say is... WOW! When I first looked at the menu, I gave it a little eye roll because it did seem a bit overpriced, but it was honestly worth every penny. We started off with a dozen oysters, and I must admit, the oysters were a tad small, but the entrees certainly made up for the small appetizer. I had the Maryland Fluke and my partner had the Sea Bass - both were cooked and seasoned perfectly, so much so that we actually had to pace ourselves because we wanted to savor every bite.  In addition to the wonderful food, the ambiance is trendy and perfect for a date or small gathering. The drinks (both the alcoholic and dessert beverages) were a little underwhelming, but the food was so good that it made up for it! I highly HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone who wants some good seafood - I know for sure we'll be back!> I know this place has been a staple near Kenmore square and almost all of my friends have gone here at least once. But I just don't see the appeal of coming back after trying. Even though I booked a reservation, we still had to wait 15 minutes before being seated. We ordered the oysters which is disappointing, it's fresh but a couple were not cleaned properly (stones inside).  Not worth 3+ dollars per oyster when there is dollar oysters at other places during happy hour. Other seafood there is nothing really memorable about it. The quality is good but that's to be expected from an upscale place. The service was good but the ambience seems casual and loud for fine dining. I think it's fine to try this place once, but I have not gotten back and I don't plan on doing that anytime soon.> In this case, believe the hype..the Lobster Roe Noodles with Beef Short Rib are a must. However at this restaurant there are many great menu options to choose. But before we talk food, here are details on the restaurant and service.  The atmosphere is lively and fun within a large open space. The restaurant has mellow feel with soft lighting in the dining area, which is offset with a more vibrant and lively feel at the bar. On many visits our service has been nothing short of exceptional. With a server focus not only on helpfulness but also on their friendliness and menu suggestions. The food is inventive and unique, especially when it comes to their Lobster Roe Noodles with Short Rib (photo). The noodles are cooked to perfection with larger embedded pieces of Lobster and beef Short Rib. The sauce with Lobster Roe is velvety and smooth, which compliments the noodles and assorted vegetables within the dish. The other menu options are equally inventive and fabulous; such as the tuna tartare, buttermilk biscuits and fried clams/oysters.For added convenience and comfort stay at the attached Commonwealth hotel. Don't miss out on this remarkable Boston restaurant.> I have a mixed opinion about ICOB based off feedback that I had gotten from several people. There were some things they knocked out of the park and others that just made me scratch my head. First off, let's deal with the good. The bar, both raw and booze were both spectacular. Whether you prefer oysters, shrimp, crab, or anything else that you could envision being served cold you will not be disappointed here. The bar offers a great variety of value from their cocktail, wine, and beer menus. These are not your run-of-the-mill offerings either. They are creative and unique, offering most people a little taste of something they may not have had recently (or ever before). We had a dozen oysters that came with thoughtful toppings that didn't destroy the flavor of the meat, but rather just brightened everything up for us. The server even did the selection for us as we are not very educated in the oyster world and trusted him to guide us based on our preferences. He did spectacularly and even chose based on what we had ordered to drink as well. Truly a gifted young man, as we enjoyed this thoroughly!Now, at this point you're probably wondering why 3 stars for a rating based off my previous portion of the review. It comes down to the lobster roll to be honest. I was told this was one (if not THE best) in the city. With high hopes (and a deep wallet), I ordered the roll and was prepared to be amazed. Unfortunately, this was one of the more disappointing rolls I have had in the city. The lobster meat itself had bits of shell throughout the meat and was a bit overdressed than I prefer (and with celery). The slaw was also a bit disappointing as it did not have very much flavor compared to some of the other places that were near half the cost. The best part of the $35 plate was honestly the fries. THOSE were some delicious, peppery fries! When you are let down by the reason you visited a place, I can't just help but feel a little let down. When you couple that with the price, I think that justifies my overall rating. However, if I were to eliminate the roll from my experience then I would probably have given this a 4 or 5 star rating. I would never coax people away from ICOB, as they have a lot of great things to offer people. Their raw bar is out of this world, the service is amazing, and their drink menus will hit all the notes for all the right people.However, if you are looking for a great (and traditional) lobster roll experience, you'll be better serviced elsewhere in the city.> This was one of the restaurants I always wanted to try! I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I came here because I won a gift card from work!The ambiance is chic and classy. This is a perfect place for a date night/an anniversary dinner. I suggest making a reservation if you want to dine here because it does get pretty busy even during the weeknight!I really like the items on their menu. First of all, you can't go wrong with east coast fresh oysters to start. They have so many options to choose from too. We tried their salmon tartare, lobster roll and lobster roe noodles. I was told you have to try the lobster roll here! Wow, I would say the lobster rolls here are within my top 3 in Boston! I was impressed! If you are a fan of lobsters, I recommend getting both the lobster roll and lobster roe noodle! Our server was very attentive and came back to check on us very often.

By then, all the tables had been booked so we decided to wing it and ended up being seated at the bar. The place itself is pretty cramped (I kept bumping elbows with the guy next to me) so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.Other than the hostess who seemed to bored to be there, the service was excellent. Our waiter made sure to check on us and fill our waters whenever they got low. He also ran outside to find us because I accidentally left my credit card there after paying.As for the food, there was a bread basket to share. The three of us ordered a salad, a pizza, and a pasta dish, with the pizza itself comfortably feeding two people. Considering the location and portion size, I would say the meal was worth the price.It got pretty loud at times and it was hectic with people coming in and out to pick up their to-go orders, so if you're looking for somewhere you can have an intimate conversation, I wouldn't recommend. Otherwise, I would come back to try more of their menu.> I've been to Figs quite a few times over the years and its always a pretty solid experience. The interior is cozy and intimate, a great spot for an impromptu date night. Service is usually on point- though occasionally they will have too little staff and you'll be waiting with a room of empty tables. I wouldn't fault the servers, more of a management issue. They do a flatbread style pie with a thin crust. Pizza has always been consistently good. My favorite is the fig and prosciutto pizza. Generous amounts of prosciutto with the right sweetness from the figs makes this a delicious go-to. The crispy eggplant and spicy shrimp are my other favorites and will usually go half with fig and prosciutto. I've had the crispy calamari and it wasn't my favorite because the half of calamari gets soggy from sitting on the pizza. Great idea and maybe they can come up with a away to fix it. All in all- a date night here will set you back somewhere between $50- 60 bucks if you stick to pizza and grab a drink.I'd stick to the pizza because the portions are quite generous. I think its pretty good value for high-end pizza and its probably the best pizza this side of Boston.> This place deserves the four stars it has. The food is quite excellent. We had the spicy chicken pizza with ricotta, onions and balsamic. Exceptionally tasty. The wine selection also seems pretty good though the pours felt a little small. My one complaint is that the space is tight and I really wish they wouldn't pack people in like sardines. It's difficult just getting seated at your table. Otherwise the atmosphere is pretty nice.> Came here after walking past while touristing in the neighborhood. It's definitely crammed and has a hole in the wall feel. We were so squished in that my husband and I (both with petite statures) has trouble getting in and out of a two top table.The food was okay. Had a salad and pizza to share. The nice part of the pizza was you could do 1/2 one flavor and 1/2 the other. While the one half we ordered was not memorable, the calamari side was - but not for good reason. The calamari tasted frozen and overdone.> Always delicious pizza. Got stuck in Boston for the night down the street and walked there for dinner, brought it back to the hotel and enjoyed my half mushroom half fig/ prosciutto pizza.

So many vegetarian and fish options (along with meat). Aside from the ceviche, which was the star of the night, I really loved the scallops, hamachi tostadas (fish), and sweet potato plates. Each plate is pretty small, so we ordered a lot of duplicates for our whole party.The drinks are very artsy and tasty, definitely instagram-worthy. The whole place has a very cool vibe, and the back has an area with lounging couches and a larger size table for big parties. Definitely get the churros for dessert! They are way better than normal churros, very airy, and come with dipping chocolate and cream.> A ""let-down"", after watching a segment on The Phantom Gourmet, I really wanted to try this Mexican inspired tapas restaurant. The greeting at the door was fairly lukewarm. I did not have a reservation but it looked widely available on Open Table...I was alone so they asked me if I wanted to sit in this cramped corner in the window of the restaurant facing the street on a tiny stool? All the while there were plenty of empty tables and at least 6 empty tall chairs at the main bar. Bartenders were friendly, I ordered a beer, the street corn, the chicken wings and brisket tacos. The corn was alright and unusual in its preparation; but very messy to eat...The chicken wings sucked, they tasted sour and chalky. The brisket tacos were cold, dry and the meat tasted like it was made with corned beef out of those imported cans. I can't say I enjoyed this experience,  nor would I would I return. I'm really starting to question the credibility of phantom Gourmet and their recommendations.> I love love love Citrus & Salt! I'm so happy I finally got to check this place out. Everything about this place is sooo cute! The decor, the music, the energy...it is all so wonderful! The place gets really packed so I'm glad we made reservations for 7 people for dinner time. The drinks are amazing and the food is just so good. We started off with the ahi tuna ceviche, half a dozen oysters, some chips & guac, and then two plates of street corn. Honestly all of these dishes were so delicious. But for 7 of us, they were small portions (I really felt like I could've ate the whole ceviche plate to myself ) I really loved the street corn. It was mixed with hot Cheetos and that really just put me in an all time happy mood. For tacos we had the blackened mahi tacos, the New England lobster taco, and the braised brisket taco (not pictured because all my friends devoured it too quickly for me to even snap a pic). But I would definitely order the brisket tacos again. That was seriously the best one out of all of the tacos I tried.  Some places overcook the brisket making the meat dry but wow their brisket is so juicy! That's the best kind of tacos you can get. I'm glad I was able to sample out the different tacos they have because honestly all of them were really good. Drink: I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. This was one of the best margarita drinks I've had. I liked that it didn't melt easily or turn watery as fast as some places do. Parking: Street Parking I would definitely come to Citrus and Salt again. So happy I finally got to check this place off my list of places to try out in Boston!> This place is really cute. I went in for drinks with a friends. Couldn't get a reservation in advance, but the bar is a first come first serve. Was able to get a seat at the bar for two. The bartender was really sweet. He was very attentive. The minute I sat down he asked if I needed something. He was open to making recommendations and answered questions about menu items. I Did not get to eat, but did have the guacamole and chips, which was fresh and good. The portion could have been bigger but it wasn't super small. Had the house margarita with a nip and it was delicious. My friend ordered the guava margarita and also liked her drink. I'll come back, and next time will make reservations in advance.> I decided to try this restaurant as it was highly recommended by my coworkers. As recommended, make a reservation as it gets very busy (lunch and dinner). The server was nice and attentive. As it was our first time there, she gave us her top recommendations for both drinks and food. She asked us if we wanted to start off with chips and guacamole (did not mention there would be a cost). I noticed that she also pushed it on the party next to us.  They were upset when they saw the bill because the server did not mention it prior to offering. We were recommended a couple dishes and turned out did not enjoy the octopus dish. As she came over to check on us, she noticed that we did not touch the dish and voluntarily offered to take it away. When the bill came, yes, we were charged for the chips and guacamole. However, she took off the octopus dish because she felt sorry for suggesting something and not enjoying it as much as she hoped!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Nice addition!> The food is good. My friend & I shred a chips-Guac-Sala (I think it was $14) then each of us got the brisket taco and the brisket bowl respectively. I believe the tacos were $14 and came in with two of them and bowl was $20. Portions are not big. A bit hard to imagine it could fill up a guy's appetite if you are ordering what we ordered. The taste was good! Drinks prices are normal, not overwhelming, consider the vibe that they are going with(definitely kinda hippy). I went pretty basic ( and safe) with the red sangria. Taste pretty good but did not really wow me. In general, I will give a 4 stars and can definitely see where it be a place that people would go on date.Just one note though, it is inside The revolutionary hotel which I was having a hard time finding it till the guy at the hotel door asked me if I was looking for the restaurant lol> During a staycation at the Revolution my boyfriend and I decided to try out the drinks and apps. Service was excellent, so that definitely isn't an issue here. We sat at the bar and were served quickly and attentively. It was the food and drink inconsistencies that I probably wouldn't come back for. We both ordered the margaritas on tap and the first round was delicious, light and refreshing (almost like a skinny margarita but still packed a punch.) The second was a completely different color and looked like it contained a lot of orange juice. When I asked the bartender why they were different, she explained they had just switched over the tap which made complete sense but still, not for me. As for food we only got the chips/guac/salsa, mostly because of how filling it actually was we didn't feel the need to order more. I'm obsessed with guacamole and order it every chance I get, this was one of the worst guacs I've ever had. It was the smokey jalapeño that completely ruined it for me, it overpowered the other flavors completely. However the salsa was good, I almost finished the bowl.> Came here for dinner with a friend on opening night without realizing so. I'm always a fan of Mexican food and cosmica does it right. Fairly small menu but the dishes are authentic with a unique twist. We really enjoyed everything we had - I loved the mole poblano tacos and the shrimp quesadilla. Chips and salsa were good and margs are great. Was weary of them being ""on tap"" but they pack a punch without tasting like a shot of tequila (aka they sneak up on you!) It was Maxi's first night serving and he killed it :)> Really enjoyed our visit here!  Servers and managers are super friendly, vibe is bright and fun, good music playing.  There's a huge outdoor patio that I bet is going to be amazing in the warmer months.  Highlights of the meal for us:- Cauliflower al pastor - this really hit the mark.  Sweet, savory, perfectly rounded bite.   - Mole poblano chicken taco - savory, moist, fabulous- skinny dipper cocktail (for 2) - mezcal and smoked pineapple served in a huge pineapple to share.  Honestly one of the better large format cocktails I've had in recent memory.  Our server said they only make ~20 of these a night in the pineapples, so recommend ordering early on in your meal.Pretty solid:- chips and guac - Chips are thick and tasty, guac is really solid, elevated with red onion, tomato, queso fresco, a little bit of jalepeno - esquites - corn off the cob in a crema-ish soup.  Definitely has a spicy kick, and a bit difficult to eat with a fork (forks and knives in containers on the tables) as the crema base is watery.  Would be great to serve w/ a spoon.  Would skip:- vegano taco - fermented black bean slaw took it in too sour of a direction, and it was a cold taco which felt a bit off.  Looking forward to a return visit!  Would be a fun spot with a large group.",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Wonderful pesto sauce and perfectly cooked gnocchi. Highlight might have been dessert though. Beautiful presentation and even better tastes. Tried both the Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Hazelnut Gelato Torta...could not say or spell it for the life of me BUT unbelievable. Together the two were extremely filling but worth it. Think I preferred the Flourless Cake just a bit more. Warm, rich chocolate cake with a creamy vanilla bean gelato topping that melts into the cake. So GOOD. Will be thinking about this one for a while (:> The meatballs rocked!Ceasar salad was fineThe entrees were epic. Great for the cost. Service was above average. Great music selection, I want  that  Playlist!> We visit Boston frequently (my wife and I went to college at BU and lived in Brookline for a few years after), and Piattini has become a go-to for us as a very good lunch or dinner option with the kids.The Back Bay area is filled with a ton of restaurants, but it can be difficult to find a spot that both has good food and is kid-friendly.  Some of the best restaurants just aren't great places for the kids, either because of menus or because of the quiet atmosphere. Piattini is an exception.Located on Newbury Street, you can miss the restaurant if you're not familiar with the area, as it's down a set of stairs. Given it's on Newbury, parking is an issue - if you are staying in the Copley area and it's a nice enough day, walking is the preferred option.  The space is larger than it looks from the outside, but I'd recommend reservations if you're eating during a high-volume dinner hour.The menu is fantastic, with a variety of salad, pasta, and meat dishes. My favorites are the meatballs, the gnocchi, and the ravioli.  The chopped salad is solid as well - the lemon pesto dressing gives a light, flavorful finish.  We've had nothing but excellent service on every visit, even during the busiest times.Overall Piattini is definitely recommended as either a lunch or dinner option in the Back Bay.> Had the best solo lunch here! Was traveling in Boston on business and just needed to have some alone time. It was around 2 or 3pm when I decided to stop at Piattini due to a recommendation to try the gnocchi from a vegetarian friend. I took a seat outside and was serviced very amicably and efficiently.I ordered a cafe latte and the spinach gnocchi as per my friends recommendation. The temperature at the time was very comfortable and the comforting food added to the overall feeling of relaxation and contentment. A little bird even came to sit on my table and tried to steal an entire slice of complimentary bread! Though the bread was much too heavy for it.That gnocchi was great. And so was the service. Will definitely be back in the warmer months to enjoy people and bird watching in their outdoor seating section.> This is a great Italian place right in downtown Boston, specifically Back Bay area. I personally really enjoyed my experience there. The space has a nice ambiance. They can offer more intimate, personal dining experience for dates or for large parties alike. The waitresses were polite and efficient. They greeted you, asked nicely if we had any reservation, brought out the food promptly for everyone in your dining party..and take care of my requests you have.The food is also just as good. Even for lunch, we found the portion size to be good..and with great prices, too (pasta dishes for lunch go for $11-15..not bad at all!). Everyone in our dining party enjoyed the meal. I had their lobster ravioli ($13) and thought the portion was just right. It was on a light lunch side...but definitely kept me satisfied through remaining of the day. Their other pasta dishes like angel hair or spaghetti seemed to be more filling though..so if you are hungry..you may want to go for that..or pick a pasta dish and another appetizer or two...and you will be satisfied.I definitely want to stop by Piattini again in the future. But I will also want to make sure I RSVP ahead of going there for sure. Their space isn't too big..so if you want a nice Italian place in Back Bay...save on a potential headache and make a reservation ahead of time!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

I would gladly eat this bowl several times a week if I lived in the area. The 3 types of salmon in this bowl were each so delicious in their own way. The salmon sashimi: a perfect texture, gorgeous color, not fishy at all, incredibly fresh. The salmon belly: fatty and succulent and indulgent. The minced salmon: imparted with a yummy savory flavor. All over a bed of soft white rice. Miso soup on the side, and 2 pieces of very small but delicious pickled veggies. All for $18, a bit of a splurge but for a quality sashimi bowl it's actually quite a steal.Not to mention the gorgeous ceramic mugs, bowls, and plates here that we ate and drank out of. I admired their subtle colors and shapes. They looked handmade and represented Japanese culture beautifully. And the wooden soup spoons had the restaurant logo engraved on them. Such delicate thoughtful touches that made the experience more personal. The vibe is down to earth, not super fancy, but feels very new and clean. I sat at the sushi bar with a friend, and service was great! I will definitely come back to try other sashimi bowls. For now, I will have to settle for dreaming of Tora Sashimi bowls.... :)> I actively crave the Kaisen don from Tora probably every other day because the fish just tastes that good. The first time I came here, I agonized over the menu for a solid 15 minutes and decided on K13 (Nagahama Don), which is a mix of spot shrimp, salmon, yellowtail, squid, mackerel, and uni, and I also added a side order of ikura. The bowl had a really generous portion of fish / seafood, and everything tasted (and looked) so fresh and amazing!The entrance to Tora is a bit hard to find (hint: it's underground), but the smaller space make for a pretty cozy / intimate vibe. I'm really looking forward to coming back!> Located in the basement of Chinatown, I wouldn't have expected to find a restaurant with high quality sushi! Though the portions look small, it is definitely a very filling meal. It's hard to find parking around Chinatown, but definitely worth the trip.The Itadori Don was a mixture of salmon, tuna and assorted seafood. There's a little bit of salmon roe, scallop, octopus which is great for someone that wants to try a little bit of everything. Sake Aisuru Don is a salmon laid on top of a bed of rice. I went on a Friday night around 7 and it was packed and the wait time can be around 1 hour since tables are limited. The bowls are not only aesthetically pleasing, but you can also taste how fresh the fish is. 10/10 would recommend to a friend!> I came with my boyfriend on a weekday evening for dinner. It was very crowded, so we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated.I ordered the sake aisuru don because I LOVE salmon sashimi. The miso soup it came with was delicious and perfectly salty. I LOVED the sake aisuru don! The three variations on the salmon sashimi were all so delicious and fresh! I especially loved the slices that made up the rose, since they had the most fat! We also got the takoyaki to share. They were all wonderfully crispy on the outside and super flavorful on the inside! The sauce and toppings that it came with made the dish so much yummier! The service was a quick and efficient. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely come back!> This review is only for their vegetarian Tofu & Avocado Sweet Ginger Poke bowl because I'm not a huge fan of meat or seafood. This is my go-to bowl whenever I'm in the mood for something filling and delicious!For $11, you get diced plain tofu, sliced tomatoes, avocado, corn, boiled edamame, seaweed salad, and cucumbers on a bed of flavorful sushi rice. The finishing touches? Fried wonton chips, nori, and an abundance of sweet ginger sauce!!! This bowl may look plain at first glance but each bite is *SO* flavorful. I was blown away when I first tried it back in the summer. All of the toppings they use are fresh (overly brown avocados? nope, not here) and crunchy and the sushi rice is out of this world! It's mildly sweet and goes so well with all the ingredients. The sweet ginger sauce is literally the best thing ever. I could probably drizzle it over anything, tbh. I'm always so full and content afterwards. My co-workers really love the salmon, salmon roe, and uni here. They always comment on their freshness and good quality! Take note, seafood lovers!I've never dined in before because my co-workers and I always do takeout via the Ritual app, but it's pretty bustling around lunchtime. The space is quite snug and houses a few tables and some seats by the sushi bar. Just a tip- if you're ordering around lunchtime on an app, make sure to do it well in advance since they can get pretty busy sometimes!",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Two of us got salads, and the rest got sandwiches that came With  plantain chips. I got the remolacha con cabré salad, and it was SO good! That and an appetizer left me satisfied. (The tequenos are delish!)From from my coworkers said, the sandwiches were AMAZING. Can't wait to try one. If you work  in the area, it's a great place for lunch.> Pretty darn good. Ordered the Parilla Caraquena sampler platter on a dark, rainy night.Definitely hit the spot. The seasoned strip steak was tender, the chicken, guasacaca and chorizo were flavorful, and the hot sauce was incredible. Just kept pouring it on even though it made me sweat up a storm.Great spot to celebrate an occasion for sure.> Empanada trio sampler was very good. The Carne asada and cheese one were my favorite. Service was good. Neat hidden location with a nice interior ambiance. They have 2 other locations. Arepas were a bit cold to where the cheese wasn't melted and the guacamole cold cooling it even more. The plantein could've been a little softer to my taste. My mother's Venezuelan and makes better arepas than this. 'It aint like mama fixed it.' Bathrooms were clean. $36 for 3 of us with waters.> Haven't had better latin food in the Boston area until now. Orinoco did everything absolutely right for me. Went here for brunch recently, but I came across this place for the first time during a food tour of the Southend. They're bacon wrapped dates and sweet plantains will leave your mouth watering for more. The eggs and arepas were both on point! The beans were probably more flavored than I would have expected and the shredded pork did not disappoint. I also would recommend their red sangria. 5 stars and a must do in the Southend. I think this is a great place for dinner, lunch, and brunch. Basically all of the above! The seating area on the inside is a bit small, but on a Sunday afternoon they aren't too crowded.

It's loud. It's crowded. It's great.

Yankee Lobster took all my delicious seafood dreams and served me food from the heavens. This small restaurant comes reasonably price (that's real hard for seafood in Boston) and attracted the attention of the one and only Guy Fieri with a spotlight on the hit (and mouthwatering) show, Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. On the cold, blistery, and rainy night, I elected to order a small cup of Clam Chowder and the restaurants signature dish, The Yankee Lobster Roll (fried pollack and coleslaw (I got it without the bacon and tomatoes) on a toasted roll). With both of those orders I felt as if the ghost of Food future visited me and told my life had peaked right there in the restaurant, eating the world best fish sandwich. I couldn't imagine a better experience for my first night in Boston and the Yankee Lobster Company place made this Floridian very happy (and very full)!> When in Boston , a must eat is the infamous lobster roll! I highly recommend trying Yankee Lobster. Beware though, the smell of fresh seafood will hit you as soon as you enter the door. I came with three other friends around 12:30. Any later, it would have been difficult to find a seat. The restaurant is pretty small and can fill up quickly. Order at the front and they will bring the food to you.Clam Chowder: Slim on the clams, but filled with tons of potatoes! Very creaming and amazing flavor all around.Hot Lobster Roll: The bus was thick, buttery, and toasted perfectly. Yankee Lobster did not disappoint! My roll was filled with fresh, thick lobster. The fries on the side had great potato to fry ratio. Thin and crispy!Overall, great lobster rolls all around!

I didn't have any places in mind - so i took a quick search on yelp and came across this place. I had a bit trouble finding parking (small parking lot with limited capacity), so we had to drive around a bit until we found a meter parking close by. Unfortunately, 5 minutes is 25 cents so be prepared to have some coins on you!! Once i got inside - i had this first impression where the place had a ""retro"" feels to it.

Other than that, the staffs and cashiers were super friendly and attentative. They recommended us what to get and was pretty quick with our orders. Just like i mentioned, the SCALLOPS is a must.

There is a validated parking lot right across the street and it is a huuuge plus. The place was not too busy so we were seated right away in a booth with a chair placed on the end so it was kind of cramped but not a big deal. The waitress was friendly and did a great job of keeping the coffee flowing and patient as it took us a while to look at the menus and order.Everyone got the pre-fix brunch which were all pretty solid. Came with a coffee cake, coffee, omelet with fries or french toast. The food wasn't out of this world but definitely a great deal and very satisfying. It was great to have this option with a medium size group!> So to start off, I'm French and let me tell you this place is an insult to be called French food. But let me start with the PROS:- Decor and drinks/bar very good- Fun Fact: this place shot a scene of Ted here.- If they know how to serve Suze or similarly Pernod correctly, you're off to a good start, sadly this is where to buck stops.Now the CONS: - It's soo Salty I spat the food and could not taste my breakfast the next morning.- The concept of the food is there, but the execution and presentation is dreadful. - The marinade they use for their steak is the same as their escargot... unbelievably lazy. I'm a huge proponent of reusing parts of food but to not alter them, disgraceful.- The portion size of protein - smaller than Michelin started restaurants. I like my main platter (Steak) to be bigger than the sides (French fries/salad)- Please be more consciousness of the sauce, when my béarnaise sauce separates or the escargot marinade separates... that's a problem.- Oh and way too loudOVERALL:- If you're looking for a nice French restaurant whether for a date or - please choose from the 3 other options around the area- Great drinks, horrible food- Brunch is meh, lunch is dreadful, dinner is dreadful^2> Atmospheric as all get out, and the menu screams Parisian bistro but the execution is fairly plain Jane.Been for crepe et oeuf brunch (a solid prix fixe deal, true to the Aquitaine Group's legacy as a destination for midday mealers), dinner and drinks and find the casual, not too large bar scene is where it's at. Brass and browns aplenty, and there's a sizable lot adjacent to the restaurant if street parking is rare.For classic French specialties, I prefer eating at Ma Maison, Frenchie or Bar Lyon. For socializing with mis amies and agreeable light bites, Gaslight is an easy go-to.> We came here for brunch and it was lovely! We unfortunately missed the pre-fixe brunch which looks like a steal, but we ordered from the regular brunch menu. We ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, French toast, and Berkshire pork hash. Smoked salmon eggs Benedict was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. French toast was surprisingly not too sweet which we enjoyed. Our favorite was the pork hash topped with an egg, very flavorful and rich. We also ordered the drink called Grey't Expectations. Very cute name and would probably be tasty, but they did a heavy heavy pour on the gin. Technically very worth the money for the alcohol content, but probably equivalent to just sipping on straight gin. Overall, would recommend for brunch! Interior is very comfortable and cute.> Honestly this is one of the best places to grab brunch in all of Boston. From the exemplary service to the absolutely delicious food this place deserves all 5 stars from me. The berkshire pork hache is possibly the best hash I've ever had in my life. It was crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. You can see the strands of pork and potato perfectly mixed on the inside. The eggs and toast on the side only added to delicious ensemble. The egg with its runny yolk delivered a creaminess that elevated the pork hash to another level. When you put all three together, the toast, the hash and the egg, it becomes pure bliss. A perfect mix of texture and flavor. The toast provided the crunch, the creaminess of the eggs and then the flavor and impact of the hash. Great place for mimosas as well!

Most places will offer discounted day-olds or at least be mindful and let their customers know if something wasn't prepared that day but I wasn't told anything of it. Slightly disappointed by this, but overall I had a good experience here.> If you're in the mood for Mediterranean, anoush'ella is the right choice. Their mezze are out of this world, very fresh and packed with flavor. We got the platter for two, as well as a side of chicken. The platter featured cold mezze, and the employee was very flexible about making substitutions for us.The walnut harissa was my favorite part of the platter - hearty, with just enough spice to keep things interesting. But honestly, every cold mezze we had was great, we cleaned the plate!The restaurant is a fast casual setting, maybe slightly fancier than a Cava; there are seats/booths in the back for a more sit-down experience, compared to the bar and communal table in the front.

The only downside is that you'll probably have to wait for a table- but it's worth it.The complimentary bread was good- pretty standard Italian bread. I had the garlic bread appetizer. It was the same bread as the appetizer, but drenched in garlic oil. I had looked at pictures on Yelp and thought the bread had cheese- sadly it did not. However, it was still definitely worth the $4. I ordered the lobster ravioli, based on the reviews. Lobster is my favorite food and I am very picky. The lobster ravioli was the best I've ever had. Eight plump ravioli, stuffed with fresh lobster meat. The sauce was creamy and delicious. Highly recommend!For desert, I was torn between the chocolate truffle bomb and tiramisu. My friend ordered the chocolate truffle bomb and I tried it. The cake (part of the truffle bomb) was nothing special- standard chocolate cake. I ordered the tiramisu, and am very happy I did! The ladyfingers were soaked in liquor and the cake was super moist. Highly recommend!> Primary location is the way to do it. However, because it was so cold + bad timing, decided to come here tonight. Much more seating available with little to no wait time. Same menu as the famous location over on Hanover.

Top notch service great wine pairings as well. Will be back!> Great pasta and seafood place! Huge portions and everything we had was delicious. I think the original one is on the North End but judging by the reviews and pictures of both places they look equally as good. No wait at 630 on a Wednesday. Got full by 730. The wait staff was really nice and I think the owner/manager greeted us at the door. They brought soft yummy bread right to our table when we sat down which was great since we were starving. And brought waters right away too. The dishes are reasonably priced for the amount of food they give. 17 dollars for the linguine and scallop dish I ordered. Probably about 1lb of pasta and 10 scallops! Huge! My boyfriend got the tuna and swordfish fettuccine in a pesto sauce. The pesto sauce was sooo good and creamy. I liked it better than the sauce I had. Which was supposed to be a tomato and lobster cream sauce but it just tasted like tomato sauce. The swordfish (and the tuna- but I really liked the swordfish) was cooked so well and really paired better than I expected with the pesto sauce. We were contemplating getting the 65 dollar meal for 2 but that is pretty expensive. We saw it come out and it was like 4 servings. We wouldn't have been able to finish it and to share it with more than 2 they charge you an extra 10 dollars a plate. We got 2 huge delicious dishes for 34 total on their regular menu and that was plenty. The Tiramisu for dessert was amazing. The mascarpone cream was light and fluffy and a little cheesy and a lot delicious. Bold coffee flavor and great consistency with the moist cake. I had tiramisu in Italy and this was better!Cash only too btw. Loved our experience here. Next time I am in Boston I will definitely come back again!> Have been to both Giacomos, this current location in the South End and their main location in the North End. Usually go to the one in the South End as it is more accessible to me, takes reservations, and the wait is a lot shorter (main location you will probably wait on average for 2 hours). Though I would say the North End one is noticeably better and would recommend going to that one at least one.Onward to the food review. I usually order a plate of Calamari and their signature Frutti Di Mare with the Giacomo sauce. The calamari is delicious and pretty fresh seafood. Though it can be a hit or miss in terms of portion. Sometimes we get a lot, sometimes we get minuscule amounts. The Frutti Di Mare is one of if not the best Italian pasta dish I have had and it has a delicious sauce that goes along with it. It comes with a generous amount of seafood ranging from shrimps, scallops, clams, etc and a good-sized amount of linguine for its price. It is a pretty big portion that you will probably only finish half of it so you can have the rest some other day.If you are around the Prudential or South End area, I would recommend giving this place a try if you want authentic, high quality Italian food.> DINNER REVIEWIf you don't want to wait in the long lines in the North End for some authentic Italian food, Giacomo's is a great option in the heart of the amazing culinary neighborhood that is the South End.The restaurant is small but very homey...you will likely be nudged up next to diners at different tables. If you do have to wait, Anchovies next door is a great dive bar.We went on a Friday at 5:45 so we got seated immediately. We started with the Caesar Salad and Burrata (which was a special) both of which were fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say these are ""must gets"" but they are good.What I would say is a must get is the pasta (as it should be no surprise, at an Italian restaurant). Per the recommendations of the waiter, I had the frutti di mare with fra diavola sauce. The pasta was chock full of beautiful mussels, clams, oysters, and more and the sauce was perfectly spicy. This sauce...WOW!Key things to know: It's cash only and they take reservations, but otherwise the wait will be long.",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

I sat at the bar and there were a couple of larger groups hanging around (looked like coworkers). The bartender was super friendly and we chatted about different spirits and cocktails. She even showed me her cool bee tattoo after I ordered my 2nd drink (a bees knees) and told me about a bees knees event she went to. Pretty cool! The bartender mentioned that she made my bees knees different from the standard and what tasting notes came from where. I appreciated the cocktail facts. She knew her stuff!My first drink was on-menu and was a Top of the Hill (Rittenhouse Rye, Lemon-Sage, Cinzano Bianco). It was explained as kind of a ""white manhattan"" and was delicious. When my first friend arrived, he ordered a Smoke 'Em Out (Peloton Mezcal, Chamucos Reposado, Agave) and that drink was heaven for someone who likes mezcal and a smokey flavor. I tried a mezcal drink at Roxanne's afterwards and the Smoke 'Em Out blew it out of the water! Other drinks imbibed were The Aftermath and Kentucky Downs.All of the cocktails were delicious. They were ""Boston priced"" at $11-14 each, but that is to be expected with this level of mixology. I'm definitely adding this to my list of favorite cocktail spots in Boston.> Sorely disappointed. We arrived here for dinner when wanting to check out something new with good reviews. So many things wrong. First off, the menu has nothing on it. It's got a grand total of 3 entrees and 7 apps that they couldn't even bother to separate into different categories. Secondly, the entrees are the absolute bare bones. I've never seen such horrible plating on a dish, check out the steak -- what is that? Use a long thinner plate if you're going to offer nothing to the side. The dishes come with the absolute most minium side offering I've ever seen. At these prices I expect better. Even if you wanted to pay extra, the menu doesn't offer any sides to add. We left hungry and disappointed. Saving this from a 1 star review is that the drinks tasted good.> Pretty decent place. Very friendly and good service. Nice urban and classy ambiance. The food is well priced, very reasonable. Although I should add the portions are a bit underwhelming.We got the beet salad, which is quite tiny; salmon crudo, it's very well seasoned/marinated, though bit small; And burgers. The cheese on the burger is very flavorful, but I think the paddy could be a little bigger- It's kind of fast-food joint sized, not as much restaurant sized paddy. I don't mind paying a couple dollars more for a bigger, fatter paddy :)Overall, very nice experience, will return again.> Great food and service all around. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The interior was beautiful and a great marriage of vintage and modern.There were these amazing potato beignets with a cream and bacon bits on the bottom. We had two orders. The oysters were fresh and spot on as well. French fries were great, as well as braised carrots.We came in on a Saturday night and it wasn't overly busy. Great safe neighborhood and we we're ableTo find parking. We ate like kings and the bill was reasonable. I highly recommend the Emory. :)> I went to Emory for brunch on a Saturday, and had a great experience. I had a Bloody Mary and the burger, both of which were great. The burger is covered in cheese and comes with very good fries - I would go back just to eat that.Hoping to go back for dinner soon!",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Megan was a big help in setting up the reservation, and even when we had to change the reservation time due to my primary guest's flight schedule changing Joe was really helpful over the phone. Our server Devon was so sweet and very attentive, but not in a hovering sort of way. She gave us plenty of time to enjoy our Ultimate Bostonia Bloody Marys and did not rush us to order our entrees. I've eaten at Bostonia plenty of times, but this was my first time being a guest for brunch. It was wonderful! The live acoustic musician was so talented, and it was nice that they had the technology to connect him through the sound system so that all guests could enjoy his music throughout the main floor as well as the upstairs. Everyone in our group got the Ultimate Bostonia Bloody Mary. We were all competing to see who could make the biggest garnish (I think I won). We really enjoyed our entrees very much. I got the breakfast sandwich with maple sausage, and other meals to write home about u clouded the stuffed French toast, north country bacon frittata, the Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon, and the ""skillet hashes"" (my guests that had the pulled pork hash and the smoked chicken hash raved equally about both). We finished the meal with the glazed sweet potato donuts- delish!!Thank you Bostonia for providing us with such a great experience!> Was visiting Boston during the holiday season & found this restaurant just a few steps away from the pier.As expected it was crowded but, we got a seat in 10mins!Good food, nice sandwiches (lobster roll was greaaat) & drinks and, good service as well!> When going around Boston, my girlfriend and I are always looking new places to try. We found Bostonia Public House and decided to give it a try. We quickly got a table and were greeted by our server who told us about the specials and made recommendations based on our tastes.  We ordered our drinks and food and were very surprised with the speed and quality of the food. I typically shy away from ordering lobster at restaurants since some places skimp on the portion while still charging a premium, but this was not a case. The lobster was plentiful and tasted amazing. As per our server's recommendation, Get the Benedict on a biscuit, you won't be disappointed! My girlfriend enjoyed her sangria and was very pleased with her Eggs Benedict. When you visit, you have to order the sweet potato donuts. They were flavorful but not too dense with just the right amount of warm icing.For tourists and out-of-towners: Add this spot to your list of places to eat. Not far from Faneuil Hall and other known Boston attractions.> I came here with a friend (true blue local) as part of our Christmas exploration of downtown Boston. Bottom line - it was a super-delightful and very hearty true blue Boston-feel experience (I mean as much as it could be in downtown). What I loved about this place.1. It definitely had this neighborhoody feel without being too fake about it (so basically, not another run of the mill downtown restaurant). 2. The food was hearty and well portioned (but not too ridiculous Texas-sized). I had the lobster mac n cheese - it was full of large chunks of fresh-tasting of lobster.3. The oysters were also delightful - and tasted local (as in similar to other Mass oysters I have had in the past - less briney and more nutty). 4. Oh and yes... location location location...5. Still affordable (while being classy) in downtown Boston6. Lovely service - funny, attentive and caringWhy it didn't get 5 stars1. The menu could have been a bit more creative (like twists on trusty Boston steadies). 2. Great for:1. 5th dates2. Small gatherings3. Friends from out of town4. Easy breaks upsBad for:1. 1st dates2. Hard break ups> I came here for lunch after a conference and wow it was packed. They accommodated us as quickly as they could, which was much appreciated. The decor inside is nice, like a dark pub as you would expect. The wait staff was super friendly.Big fan of their cocktails (their barrel aged Manhattan is quite good). We shared the tater tot poutine - which was good. The gravy was a bit overpowering. The clam chowder was good as well. Star of the show was the classic lobster roll - so good. And highly recommended!

They serve home style Italian food. Their portions are enormous. Everything can be shared among at least 2 people or even 3. They offer fresh pasta with variety of different sauces, from marinara to the pesto. At the same time they offer fish and meat dishes. I had their antipasto, Caesar salad and lasagne. Antipasto was refreshing with a light dressing. It's a combination of lettuce, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. Nice way to start a meal with a glass of wine and antipasto. The lasagna was tasty too. We paired everything with a nice bottle of wine. Their wine list is pretty big. Most selection is Italian and American. Their wine prices are very decent and wine matches the style of the food they serve. The restaurant itself has a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Lots of wood, quite music on the background, view of a wine cellar.  Good place to have a couple dinner or small gathering.> I've been to La Famiglia's several times before and I've always been happy with the food and especially the portion size, which is HUGE (think 3 meals worth). This time, I was really blown away - the food was better than I remembered. I think there is a disparity because I ordered the specials this time, as opposed to X pasta with X sauce. There were four of us and we split three entrees and one salad. We ended up taking leftovers.Al's Favorite - I definitely recommend. It came with chicken, broccoli, gnocchi, and vodka sauce. This was the favorite of the night.Tortellini with chicken and pesto sauce - Also a favorite of the night. The pesto was very creamy.Lasagna with bolognese - this was definitely good lasagna with creamy filling, but it was the least favorite, simply because the specials were excellent.Caprese salad - fresh and delicious with soft mozzarella.They also serve bread and dipping oil at the  start of the meal. Overall, they have delicious food and very reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. We went at 6pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 mins.> ""Help me! I think I've fallen in love again!""...With this Warm cozy spot found on Salem st... For a quick minute, I died and ended up in my Nana's kitchen ... Service was attentive right from the start. Made a reservation and showed up a little early and they sat us early. Water and bread hit the table less than a minute after we did. Waitstaff extremely intelligent and gracious, offering excellent suggestions at every instance. (This differs from some previous experiences  I've had in the north end). Wine offering was very good and the price points accessible. But the food ... the food is why we go... and it is the best I have had in the north end. (Period))And I've conservatively tried at least 30 restaurants over the years, and La Famiglia exceeds every experience I've had based on quality and quantity of their dishes and the speed and attentiveness of service. Easily 5 stars Buon Appetito!!> This was a great late lunch, I'm a lucky lady my partner invited me out for fruitti de mare, a full plate of your choice of pasta penne or linguini in either white sauce-olive oil, garlic, etc., or house red, or a fresh tomato.  I picked house red, terrific with penne.  The dish came with a generous amount of calamari, mussels, and little necks.  Did I mention they have a luncheon menu, but we really came for the great frutti de mare on the regular dinner menu a larger portion than luncheon menu.  My partner insisted we get the dinner size, not a problem.  The shellfish was very fresh, pasta cooked perfect.  The marinara was delicious.   The place was busy with many out for lunch.   It is cozy and I love the fireplace and the way this place is tucked into the building. The bread is fresh and warm with a bit of hot in the olive oil dipping sauce.  We could have gotten one plate and shared but my other likes eating big!We will be back, we bring our visitors here always a memorable dinner or lunch.> Great place to gather and be welcomed as if one of the family..!La Famiglia Giorgio, located down a narrow side street on the Northside, smack dab in little Italy.  Seriously, as we walked around with google leading the way we felt like we were transplanted to another time and place.   Love the location.  Very quaint.  Parking can be a little challenging. Recommended by our knowledgeable Bostonian friends, we knew we were in for a treat.  At 5pm we were quoted a wait of an hour for a party of eight.  When the last person of our group arrived and checked in with the host about 5 minutes later we were taken right in.  So nice to know a relation of the Godfather.  From a tiny bar downstairs with a few tables we were ushered upstairs which opened up to a rather roomy dining room full of life and noise.  Everyone talking, singing, having a great time!The service was quick, efficient, jovial.  The food was, well it was in MASSIVE proportions!   Our friend who recommended Giorgio's was most familiar with the huuge menu so we happily left the ordering to him.  Had a sampling of antipasti salad, chicken parmigiana, large meatballs, clams...what didn't we have?!!?

I will start off by saying this; if you are trying to find some authentic Tex-Mex, this is not it. However as a Texan, I was pleasantly surprise by Lolita. It gave me a little bit of that tex-mex fix in somewhat a boujee way? You will not find authentic street tacos, deep fried cheesy rellenos or char-grilled fajitas here. What you will find is tequila with grapefruit flavored shaved ice as a palate cleanser, appetizers like pinto bean hummus and cauliflower fritters along with some other non traditional dishes. I was craving tex-mex so I went ahead and ordered what looked familiar to me, carne asada. The meat was delicious - very tender and juicy. IT was served with grilled onions and scallions. I also got an order of hibachi shrimp which was served with a garlic-lime marinade and yellow rice. Did I need two plates? Yes because the portions are not Texas sized portions whatsoever and I like to eat. Finally, I did not personally try the grilled steak tacos but my friend thoroughly enjoyed the prime sirloin with the garlic butter flavor. Overall, I really loved the vibe here. The atmosphere is dim. I will for sure come back to try other dishes. The server was extremely accommodating when I asked for no dairy in my food. I'll have to go back there and try some of their drinks and desserts. Only issue is that the wait time is usually ridiculous and reservation can be confusing.> I had a reservation for a party of four on Monday at 6PM. My friends and I arrived to Lolita's five minutes before our reservation and was rudely asked to step aside so the host could help the person behind me. Ten minutes go by and was still standing in the waiting area; she did not inform me of the delay until I asked her. She said the servers are still preparing the table and would take anywhere from 10-15 minutes. However, the person that was behind me did not have a reservation and asked for a table for four people; they were seated before us. Finally, we got seated 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation.On the other hand, our server was good! We asked her about the taco deal (the menu or servers don't mention this). The server did not know about this deal and asked her colleague. She came back and told us this deal is still available, however, we are required to purchase an alcoholic beverage - we still thought this was a good value.> Typically when I write a review I do my best to use all the fancy words that generation Food Network and all my fellow foodie wannabes try to use on Yelp to sound like professional reviewers. But I have no such words here. I'm simply too positively overwhelmed. Easily one of my top 3 restaurant experiences of my 50 years, Lolita Cocina delighted not only my wife and me but also our two 14 year olds who were with us. That's an accomplishment. They ""hate Mexican."" Well, maybe they don't so much after all.Service? Perfect, perhaps even better than that. We were particularly impressed with the busy waitress' patience in explaining everything succinctly, without stress, and helpfully. I'm sure we increased our tapas style purchase 25% or more just due to that. Well played. Food? Beyond amazing.Tequila flights? Typically not my jam. Tried 6 tequilas at a pretty reasonable price, all amazing. I felt like I'd finally been let in on a secret that there's more to the high end world of spirits than whiskey. Seriously. Secret club type stuff!Cleanliness and comfort? Immaculate.Décor & ambiance? Amazing.Don't make the same mistake that I did by passing year after year planning to ""eventually"" try this place. Go now. Right now. Still reading??> Came for drinks only and glad we did....Really cool and dark ambience with a basement kinda feel.I went with the Diablo, a spicy margarita that was tasty af with a nice spicy kick.Lizzy went with a strawberry basil mojito(she apparently forgot this is a Mexican joint), but she seemed to really enjoy it.Drinks are made with all natural and fresh ingredients.Def be back for food soon ...> Came to celebrate a friend's birthday but we forgot to make reservations so we ended up waiting for about an hour. Lolita Cocina is pretty popular so I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, which you can do through Opentable. The ground-floor space is quite dim inside and the red/black interior palette enhances Lolita Cocina's gothic ambience. We ordered the street corn panzanella ($12), yellowtail ceviche ($16), the nachitos ($12), and a pitcher of the ginger peach sangria ($33) for the table. Lolita Cocina is definitely a place for sharing, which makes it a great place for groups or date night. I loved the complimentary tequila-based grapefruit granita and green apple cotton candy.

I don't think I've been to a restaurant where after each plate that they brought out, they would mention that it was made with my allergy in mind each and every time. I really enjoyed their recommendations to different selections on the menu.I came for the dim sum brunch and it was delicious. My favorite dishes were the sweet and sour brussel sprouts and the spicy cold dan dan noodles. The brussels were a true harmony of sweet and a hint of sour in perfectly crisp edges and soft insides. It was truly addicting. The one downside to it was that once you get towards the bottom of the bowl, it does tend to soak a lot of the excess oil making the last pieces a bit heavier than I'd like. But overall, I'm still obsessed with the brussels and they were definitely a winner in my book. The spicy cold dan dan noodles were a close second for me even though it was a bit too spicy after you have a couple of bits, the heat does kick quite a bit and stay there. However, the dish being cold seemed to complement the spice level quite nice.Just a great atmosphere for brunch. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back to try more!> I went here around 2 weeks ago for the ""cheap date night"" special. It was a ton of food for a really reasonable price, and all of it was very tasty. We got the vegetarian menu. However, we sat in the back corner of the restaurant and felt that we were suffocating and were extremely claustrophobic from the heat of the kitchen. Additionally, when we placed our order for sake the waiter told us it was ""kinda small"" and that we should order one for each of us instead of splitting one. Turns out, the sake wasn't small, and he gave us a sake that we didn't order. This was unsurprising, since for both the food and the drink, he did not repeat the order back to us to confirm that it was correct, which in my experience, most servers do 99% of the time.I would definitely come back again since the food is phenomenal, but would hope that the service improves.> I would say it's a great place for ambiance and service. The food was standard asian fusion but slightly overpriced. It's definitely not somewhere for you to try authentic Taiwanese food. It has good drinks and you can see the folks cooking with flaming woks in the kitchen. I went with a friend and we ordered two starters and one noodle dish. The pork bun: 10/10 (delicious, but have tried similar elsewhere)Pork and chive dumplings: 10/10 (nothing to complain, nice and crispy on the outside)Stir fry udon with chicken: 7/10 ( honestly it taste like sth you can make at home. Its not bad. But just not worth the price)Beef with broccoli: 4/10 (soggy short rib with too much sauce. The sauce was too sweet and sour.  The broccoli was normal but still not great with the sauce) Pineapple Express: 9/10 (There's pineapple infused vodka in it and it tasted pretty good. I would say it's lacking a bit of complexity)Something about Rosemary :10/10 (my friend said it tasted like soda. It's delicious. Recommend to anyone who enjoys a sweet gin-based drink)The total came to close to $80.> I had a great experience at Myers & Chang this past weekend. I am not usually much of a fan of cocktails but theirs were SO good. The pineapple one was subtle and just the the right amount of sweet. The sangria had a nice tang to it also. But the pineapple one...For food: the pork dumplings were perfect. Tender and fried but not overly oily. The sweet and sour Brussels sprouts were delicious, although I don't think so much sauce was necessary at the bottom of the bowl. The scallion pancakes were soft with a crisp top layer. Everything was delicious, the music was young and fun, and the cooks looked focused and like they really cared about their work. The restaurant has a vibrant night vibe and I would be back again in a heart beat!> Bao WOW!  This restaurant went 11/11 on every dish we ordered.  The statistical odds of this happening are nearly impossible and quite impressive.  However, this proves you truly cannot go wrong here.  Close your eyes and point to a menu item and you will not be disappointed.  I came here for dim sum brunch with a large group last weekend and had a fantastic time!   I recommend making reservations online beforehand because it was packed! Our waiter was sooo friendly!  She offered excellent suggestions on menu items and was just a nice human in general.  The food comes out when it's ready which is a great way to pace yourself!  The plates are pretty small so order a lot, this is a meal you want to ball out on.  Note: the rice and noodles are on the larger side and I was able to comfortably share these dishes with ~4 people.  Full list of what we ordered:  Fresh Rolls with Spicy Peanut Sauce, Edamame Dip + Tortilla Chips, Potatoes + Shishito Relish, Ginger-Sesame Waffle Sundae, Braised Pork Belly Bao, Sweet + Sour Brussels Sprouts, Mama Chang's Pork + Chive Dumplings, Tea Smoked Ribs, Rice: Nasi Goreng/Pork + Pineapple/Fried Egg, and Wok Charred Udon Noodles with Chicken.  Here is a breakdown of my favorite dishes! BRAISED PORK BELLY BAO-  To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of pork belly but this hit the spot!  The pork melted in your mouth! SWEET + SOUR BRUSSELS SPROUTS-  Absolutely delicious, favorite dish of the meal!  They have nailed this dish down perfectly.  The brussels are charred, crispy, and packed with flavor! NASI GORENG, PORK + PINEAPPLE, FRIED EGG RICE-  Woah try saying that 5X fast.  This dish hit the spot!  All the components of this dish paired perfectly together.   The portion size is significantly larger than other menu items which is always a plus!

I should say, I used to love Legal, and I now pledge my seafood allegiance to Atlantic Fish Co. the clam chowder is amazing. The prosciutto wrapped scallops were delicious. I am a purveyor of fine martinis - the old school kind like they were meant to be drank: up, with a little bit of vermouth, and a blue cheese stuffed olive or two. Tito's, preferred. This was easily the best martini I've had in my life. Smooth, strong, and made to taste by my new favorite bartender, Wember.Sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance. I didn't have an entree but I will return my next trip to Boston - hoping the Halibut is still a featured catch!> We stopped in for lunch. The service is absolutely outstanding. Our waitress gave us helpful recommendations from the menu, offered the most delicious bread and even split the lobster bisque in two without asking! She was attentive and amazing.We ordered the lobster bisque, the lobster roll, and the lobster ravioli. The lobster roll was packed with lobster and I was able to substitute fries with a side order of broccoli rabe. The lobster ravioli was delicious as well.The ambiance is nice and upscale with tablecloth. We came for lunch during the weekday so there was no wait without a reservation. Would go back again!> We actually got recommended for their clam chowder which we 110% recommend. It's so smooth and rich! We both really loved it!! They give you complimentary warm bread rolls as an app which filled me up as I ate it with the clam chowder SO GOOD!!We also got the Maine lobster roll and the captain'S platter to which our server replied ""aye aye captain"" - everything fried shrimp, scallop, clams, haddock with fries. We have never eaten scallops so tender and melting in on your mouth!!! And I dont normally like scallops The service was friendly, its romantic but also family friendly as I saw many children eating with their parents. And we had a lovely experience. I will definitely be back to try different foods.Something we noticed is that the menu changes from lunch to dinner. I saw that they had lobster grill cheese and mac and cheese lobster on their menu online and kind of wanted to try it but when we went at dinner time it wasnt there. But all is not lost! Food was still amazing! Lovely dessert too! We got the boston pie but was so full we ate it the next day at home but it was so good!! @eatsumbap> We came to Atlantic Fish to celebrate a grand occasion.  So I really hoped we would break my streak, as each of my past three visits were not without a hiccup.   But that was not to be.They validate for parking at the Prudential Center Garage after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends, and offer valet parking over at Abe & Louie's two doors down.We arrived early for our dinner reservation and were pleased to be seated at the round table in the back corner that is a bit cozily situated with a divider between us and the kitchen.  Our server understood our situation - both in terms of our celebration and the youngest member of our party - and took care of us.Our table started off with two shared appetizers -Chilled Shellfish Platter $68 for up to 4lobster, lump crab, oysters, littleneck clams, shrimp, served with an assortment  of dipping saucesSeafood Stuffed Calamari $16 from their Specials menuscallop, shrimp and lobster stuffing with a delicate cream sauceThe Shellfish Platter had 4 each of the smaller creatures, the meat of likely a whole lobster (tail, claws, knuckles), and large lumps of cool crab meat.  The calamari was tender, filled with a tasty concoction, and accompanied by an arugula salad.Backing up a tad, the bread basket had slices of a sweetish brown bread, and sliced chunks of their bread bowl bread with its crispity crust and soft tender center.  Later, when I asked for a take-out box to take home the remaining quarter loaf, I pleasantly found a complete loaf tucked into a sack for me.Two members of our party shared one of their Feasts:King Crab & Shrimp Boil (serves 2) $991 pound steamed king crab legs and knuckles, 1 pound shrimp, andoulle sausage, corn on the cob, red bliss potatoes, served with two cups of clam chowderThis came with lobster bibs, and hot towels with lemon after to clean the fingers.They were also willing to split a bread bowl of chowder in the kitchen for two other diners who had ordered it to share.  The chowder was pretty good, though one diner voiced Legal's was better.The Lobster Risotto $40, we were told came with a lobster tail and several ounces of lobster meat in addition.  It looked good, but the diner found it a bit too salty.  I was shocked to see that the hearty eater who had ordered the fish and chips $24 (who was also sharing the bread bowl of chowder) was unable to completely clear his plate.Several of us got the Super-Lump Crab Cakes $31 which comes normally with corn pudding and cucumber-fennel slaw.  Fortunately, since I don't care for fennel, I was allowed to swap out the slaw for another side.  I found the julienne snowpeas $9 good in its simplicity, and enjoyed the corn pudding $7 despite its leaning towards egginess.  The crab cakes were a bit soft, but still good.  In fact, it was deemed better than Legal's by one vocal member of our group.After I began digging in, I noticed a splash of yellow on another plate, and realized that my plate had escaped the kitchen having entirely bypassed their QC department.  So I had to ask for the tartar sauce and socked lemon half accompaniments that were missing from my order.  (The ding of which I mentioned.)The boil looked plentiful, and there was plenty leftover for a third as the starters had already put in a huge dent in the appetites of the two diners.  I sampled it as well and found the crab sweet, the shrimp firm, the potato soft, and the sausage with a bit of a kick.Our server had ordered up a special creme brulee for our occasion, which accidentally came with the words ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate in a pretty script.  She apologized for the mishap when she delivered it, but we found it funny, and took the opportunity to break out in song before shattering through the sugar to the cool creamy custard beneath.They offer parking validation for the Prudential Center Garage, but only after 5 p.m. Monday - Friday, and anytime on Saturday and Sunday.> There are no shortages of great fishes places in and around Boston, but Atlantic Fish is a must for those seeking to elevate their experience. Located in the heart of Back Bay, Atlantic Fish is conveniently located close to area attractions including the Boston Public Library, Copley Square, and Symphony Hall. There is valet parking (located outside of Abe and Louis a couple of doors down) that makes arriving an easy experience since the area traffic is heavy and parking options are limited.There are a variety of options that are perfect for one or can be shared for two or more. The feast plates are quite literally a feast and not to be underestimated. I enjoy the fresh catch and have tried the steel head and the swordfish. With the fresh catch you have the option to choose two sides. The mashed potatoes are a wonderful staple that you can't go wrong with, but I've been most wowed by the corn pudding. I would eat it everyday if I could it is that delicious! The service is exceptional and caters well to large groups. We were heading to an evening show at Symphony Hall and they ensured that our food, check, and valet all came out and ran smoothly in plenty of time for us to eat and go to our show without feeling rushed.

I couldn't hear anything my friend was saying, the table was dirty and wet when we were seated, and the waiters seemed way too overwhelmed or just that they didn't want to be there. We got soju and beer...and the glasses they gave us were wet and hot....which is not a good combo for soju or beer...I was hoping for cold glasses. It is a Korean bar/restaurant but many of the waiters don't speak Korean, so it shouldn't be a problem for non Korean speakers. I probably won't be returning, but I heard it's definitely one of the most popular Korean bars in the Boston area.> If you want to feel like you're in Korea, this is the bar to go. They have kpop and mainstream hiphop on blast all the time. In my opinion its like a mix between a bar lounge and a mini club. There is strobe lights and occassionally a DJ present. I've also tried the food here and for late night eats (open til 2AM) with the atmosphere and drinks, its not bad at all. Especially if you get the drunchies, the selection of korean food is really good such as the budae jigae or just some classis fried chicken wings. If you're feeling adverturous then the chicken gizzards are one of me and my friends favorites. Definitely one of my top places to go for a chill night out with friends.> Came here with my friend on non-busy weekday night. We ordered corn cheese, Korean sausage(Soondae ), and Tofu Kimchi Jaeyook. As Korean national, they were alright, but I'd go for another restaurants as dishes here are so overpriced for their portion and quality. Corn cheese tasted good but Jaeyook was too sweet and I could tell that they just used frozen pre-made product for Soondae. I am quite disappointed with the place, probably not going to go back. This place is maybe worth going for if you want to enjoy variety of Korean drinks like fruit flavored soju and rice wines, however, even those drinks are overpriced I feel like.> Food was really good here. We so much food but was able to finish everything. The corn was like kernals of a candy caramel dream. It was so good. I never knew corn could be that delicious.

I have never tried lobster before so it was my first experience. They recommended the lobster roll with mayo so I got that one. I really liked the taste of the lobster meat. It was well cooked and juicy. However I did not like the mayo on top at all. It was too much.I definitely recommend James Hook for lobster lovers. They have a really nice location right next to the ocean however they don't have a lot of seats. Be ready to sit close to each other> Food is exceptional, nothing but plain and simple food. However, the food is quite pricey as the ingredients are fresh. A Large lobster roll was over 30$ when i went in February. The soups and the mac and cheese are a must. Small seating inside, larger seating outside. Do not go in groups there are no seats for you. However if you willing to test the waters and enjoy good food for a higher price, this is the place.> This lobsta is heaven sent!It's most definitely a must have for me every time I go to Boston. Fresh lobster in New England - can it get any better. I definitely think that this lobster roll is unbeatable, it hits different then the basic lobster rolls that you could get at Quincy Market for example.Squeeze a little lemon on this bad boy and your ready to rock'n roll! They also have a nice variety of sea food you can take to cook at home and some delicious New England clam chowder that is pretty impressive.> Great little restaurant in downtown Boston with a few local favorites.

We were seated immediately and our serve brought some water and bread with butter as we looked over the menu.The North End was its usual busy self but we didnt feel rushed at Al Dente.I highly recommend the lobster ravioli. I asked for a white russian drink which was not on the menu but they were willing to make it and it did not disappoint. For first time visitors we got a caramel flavored shot at the end of our course...so so good.> Had plans to stop in a few other spots the night we were in the area for dinner, the waits were over an hour so we walked by here, place was empty and we were seated Immediately. Space is small as most places in the North End are, service was casual and the waitress was super welcoming & friendly and shared stories as if we were long-time friends. I was with work people who kept telling me to order light as I had not been feeling well and I wanted to remain work courteous and I really wanted to try something heavy cream sauce, but I went with the Shrimp Fusilli instead and OMG Im soo glad I did, It was delish.  Such great flavor, Fresh pasta cant be beat! My team mates got the Chicken & Veal parm which were enough for a small family and super tasty (Im not the biggest fan or Red Sauce). They gave us little Limoncello shots at the end (I was too sick to indulge, but others said they were great)!  Definitely plan to go back once this world shut down is over so I can try the cream sauce!> Cozy Italian restaurant in the North End with large menu and great pastas, which is what we ordered.I got the Linguini Alfredo which was some of the best pasta I've had in Boston yet. They prepare the food very quickly and the service is great. The waitstaff are great, speedy, and friendly.Note: the portions are huge here! See photo. Price range is as expected for pasta.Overall great for the traditional Italian dining experience in one of the foodie hotspots of Boston.> BEST IN NORTH END! I've been coming here for 5 years! Their homemade pasta, large portions, but small restaurant front make it such a hidden little gem in North End. I highly highly recommend trying their homemade pasta -- gnocchi, fusilli, etc. you can customize each dish with what pasta you want. Delicious! My go-to are the Frutti Di Mare, Shrimp Scampi, and Vodka Sauce. Service is also very friendly. Keep in mind the place is very small so on crowded hours, plan accordingly. Atmosphere wise, strong dark mood lighting! Very homely for family or date nights out!!> WOW!!!! Wow freaking wow! I got the pesto gnocchi and it was absolutely amazing!!!! The rest of the table got lobster ravioli, Alfredo gnocchi and carbonara. We also did a meat ball with marinara. The marinara was so great!! You could not go wrong with any of them......

Insane creations they got going on there. The sushi and the staff were outta this world. We got lucky enough to get in after a phone call and the time was at 930 pm....but we did it. And let me tell you....we would do it again. If you have been eating sushi all your life.... treat yourself to OYa so you can see how its really done. Small small small place. Getting in is the hardest part. But once your there prepare to be in for a treat. Everything was spectacular.  And the host was a sweetheart and our waiter was phenomenal....Epic night...can't wait to do it again. #BuddhaReview> Came here for a special occasion. We got the grand omakase, which was 21 courses at 285 per person before taxes and a fixed 20% gratuity, and sake flights at 65 for four glasses of the bigger end sakes. Quite honestly, I had really high expectations, but O Ya turns out to be little more than an old-time Japanese restaurant trying to cash in on the success of the NYC avant garde omakase scene.If I could use one word to describe our meal, it's ""overkill"". Each course was overly bombastic in its flavor, with one or two ingredients completely overwhelming the taste of everything else, including the fish. Isn't the point of omakases to highlight the fish? The pacing felt off too - by the time the richer courses were coming out, my stomach had expected them 3 or 4 courses ago, and we started feeling sick as a result. Far from enjoyable. However, desserts were absolutely delicious, and made for quite a pleasing end for the night. The one annoying part of our meal was when the hostess seated a couple (friends of hers) at the sushi bar next to us in a space for one, midway through our meal. I ended up getting bumped by his elbow every few minutes, which made the whole experience quite a bit less enjoyable.At $440 per person total, the quality of the food and the experience did not hold up. You can get better for cheaper at both No Relation and Pabu, which is where I'd rather spend my money.Highlights were the oyster, uni and sturgeon, ora king salmon, bluefin toro, ramen, onsen egg, A5 Wagyu, and black yuzu calamansi sorbet dessert. Service was pretty solid, but I'm pretty sure it was because of the 20% gratuity ‍You can do better than here. Would not recommend.> Simply amazing.  Worth every penny surprisingly.  Service and food are spectacular.  Make sure you tell your server what you don't like!  Everything was great on the tasting menus.  The Japanese steak cubes was the the best I've ever eaten.  Insanely delicious.Hope to return one day.> Slippage. When a restaurant that used to be top-notch has slipped in quality and attention to detail. O Ya used to be one of the best sushi restaurants in the US. But it appears that expansion of the O Ya empire (to Mexico and New York) and the addition of other restaurants in the portfolio (viz., Hojoko, Covina, and Roof) have diluted the experience and left the ""mother ship"" unsupervised. For example, we arrived promptly at 5:00 pm for our reservation, and we were made to wait several minutes while the hostess got her act together (even though there was only one other party to seat, who also had to wait while the crew got organized). If you're going to charge $285 for an omakase dinner, be scrupulously prepared. Here's the breakdown:Strengths:*Still has a high level of creativity*The Kumamoto oyster with watermelon pearls was excellent*The cuttlefish with cherry blossom, shiso, and smokey bonito also was a highlight*The Kagoshima A5 Wagyu seared petit strip loin was one of the best wagyu dishes you'll ever have, with a melt-in-your mouth texture*The wine list is particularly noteworthy for a sushi restaurant*The service was solidWeaknesses:*The hostess should be much more organized. Don't make people wait when they have reservations and the restaurant is empty*The menu is a bit heavy-handed with smoking and torching. It often overpowers the beautiful, simple power of fresh sashimi and sushi*Many of the dishes would have excelled if they had been more carefully sauced. Several dishes had the sushi resting in a puddle of sauce that had not been evenly applied*The on-line wine list should be updated regularly. Nothing is more disappointing than expecting an excellent wine to be in stock, only to be told that it no longer is*I detest restaurants (like O Ya) that automatically apply a 20% gratuity. Sometimes the service does not merit such a high gratuity; don't force diners to pay it if they believe a 20% tip is not deserved> This was one fabulous meal. The food was terrific and the service was absolutely perfect. I tried the inexpensive tasting menu, which at $185 isn't that inexpensive however, it really was fabulous.

Came here for brunch with some friends. I highly recommend the Cuke Perry Bloody Mary - uses cucumber gin and has the right amount of spices and tomato juice. I had the Boomtown Burger and my other friends ordered the Chicken and Pancakes and scotch egg. It was the perfect brunch burger -a layer of fried egg, ham, arugula, cheese, and a hashbrown made for some hefty eating, but I loved it! It wasn't too greasy, meat was cooked tenderly, and I still managed to have some of each layer in each bite, which is hard to do with all those ingredients. Fries were more average than I was expecting - I don't even think they were seasoned. My friend really liked his chicken and pancakes. It was a huge portion of fried chicken and pancakes! I've never had scotch eggs, but my other friend who got it is a fan, and said theirs was really good. Overall, The Gallows is more of a hearty place for brunch, not somewhere to ""eat light."" If you're up for it, though, definitely worth a stop.> This is such an ecclectic space - there's ravens and an edger allan poe poem on the wall, hand lights over the bar, and a huge ouijie board on the wall. The music is very nostalgic for the millenials too! It was a great experience. The service is excellent and the brunch was great too!The fried chicken with the chicken and pancakes was sooo good - the pancakes were kind of dry ane not amazing but still good. The flavored butter on top really tied everything together. The poutine with the egg was interesting  and the fries were yum but I wish it was real cheese curds like I'm used to in Canada. I had never tried a scotch egg before so that was cool - wish there was more pork as it was good. Can't wait to come back for dinner!> I really wanted to like this place, but it fell a little short for me. Nothing was bad enough for me to say don't go here, but we had some issues that prevent me from recommending it. We popped in around 1 on a Saturday and were told there was a 30-45 minute wait but got added to the mobile text waitlist. I got the text that said we were third in line so we window shopped nearby for a bit. 30 minutes later we popped back in to see what the wait was and they said ""oh the hostess here before was new and didn't actually add you to the system."" ...mmkay so how do I have a text? Either way, they apologized for losing our reservation and sat us immediately at a communal table. (3 of us at a table for 8 that may or may not add more guests during our meal)The ambiance is great although the music was a bit too loud so everyone was shouting and it was the volume level of a crowded bar. The waitress was kind and took our order quickly. After what seemed like a while she came back and said that somehow the kitchen line had lost our ticket so we had to place our order again. First they lose the reservation, then the order? We were hoping they'd lose our check too but nope. They did offer my husband a complimentary second beer, but he only wanted the one. Nothing was comped on the bill. Anyway - his hash was tasty but a very small amount of hash. Moms burger was good and came with a boatload of French fries. Attached is a photo of my blackbird breakfast sandwich. I'm an idiot and didn't realize it came with buffalo sauce which isn't my favorite, but that mistake is on me of course. The potatoes were generously seasoned and delicious. Not our best experience but could've been a fluke day. I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I'd probably give it another shot if I'm back in the area for lunch or dinner instead of brunch.> Craving burgers so came back for food at the bar. Entertaining bartender and crowd with great music playing. The BK lounge was delicious (a juicy burger with special sauce, thin crisp raw onion, iceberg lettuce was SO GOOD). Truffle parm fries taste as good as they smell. The queso fundido was a little more oily than creamy, probably from the chorizo, but flavorful and a good portion. We love this funky bar / restaurant> The Gallows has the best burger I've had in Boston so far. And this is coming from someone who loves her burgs! I came in last night with friends for dinner. We didn't get cocktails so I can't speak to  those, but we did get fried pickles as an appetizer. The pickles were a nice start. I think they could have used a little something more in the seasoning but the homemade ranch was great! They use fresh herbs in what seems mostly sour cream. Very fresh tasting! For my meal I got the pub burger and upgraded my fries to poutine. When ordering our waitress did not ask how we would like the burgers cooked, but to my delight it came out perfect! Still a little pink in the middle and not dry at all. If you like your meat well done, you should specify, but also rethink your life choices. The bacon pub cheese that comes on top was so delicious too. The poutine made me a very happy girl as well. I finished my entire plate! Now if you are looking for traditional poutine this isn't it. Instead of those squeaky cheese curds, they use soft fluffy ones, the stuff that you can make cheese out of. Someone called it feta in their review.. it absolutely ain't feta.

I decided to try the beef brisket noodle soup. It was definitely on the spicier side, but the flavors were pretty spot on. The broth was flavorful and aromatic, and the beef itself was fairly tender and slightly chewy. I also added a tea egg to mine - so yummy! Definitely recommend if you've never had one before. As a Taiwanese person, beef noodle soup is always one of my favorite dishes but it's usually difficult to find a good place. Everyone does it so differently, but I really enjoyed Lanzhou's version! The portion was huge, and the prices are reasonable. Service was just okay - not bad, not great. Overall, definitely worth a visit!> I had no idea this place existed until I checked Yelp for some places to eat around Allston. It's a pretty small place, so probably not a place you want to go to with a huge group. We were greeted and seated immediately. Looked over the menu and there are even pictures on the wall so you can refer to some of the dishes! Ordered the Lanzhou Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and the Cumin Lamb Biang Biang Noodle. Food came pretty quickly which is definitely a plus. The Beef Brisket Soup was pretty good, it's a very clean flavor and I feel like it could be a bit more flavorful. The Cumin Lamb on the other hand was very flavorful and I definitely recommend this dish! If you can't take spicy, definitely ask for less spicy. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes...but the Cumin Lamb is definitely calling me to go back!> I had to try the noodles for a place that has ""fresh noodles"" advertised in their front banner.The noodles did not disappoint. The cumin lamb noodles really hit the spot for someone who likes spicy food but cannot handle very spicy dishes. I had to take a few breaks in between to calm the spice level in my mouth but the noodles really had me wanting more the whole time. The lamb was seasoned well, tender, and cut into bite sized pieces which was nice so you didn't need to rip large chunks of it apart.The noodle soup was very good as well (although the dry noodles were my favorite). The brisket was tender but could have been cut into more manageable sized pieces. It was definitely less spicy than the dry noodles . A solid dish altogether.I was pretty disappointed in the scallion pancakes. They have pictures on one of the walls that made the scallion pancakes look so enticing but the actual dish was nothing like it. Very dry with not much to it other than dough. We had to ask for some dipping sauce because they didn't bring anything out with it and it was not good enough to eat by itself.Everything did some in healthy portions so you are getting your money's worth. It is CASH ONLY so come prepared. There is a Bank of America ATM very close by in case you do forget.Beef brisket noodle soup: 4/5Cumin lamb biang biang noodle: 5/5Scallion pancakes: 2/5> New favorite noodle shop in town! Note: cash only! Very solid Chinese noodle offerings plus side dishes and soups. This place used to a chinese burger place but I think these noodles will sell better. I got the classic namesake Lanzhou beef noodle soup. It comes naturally spicy, but you can ask for it without the spicy paste. I loved the noodles, but the broth was not the deepest flavor I've had, perhaps due to the spicy paste they put in. The bowl was huge with a big serving of chewy long noodles,  making the $11 price tag very reasonable. They don't charge tip! You order at the counter, pay, and then they bring out your food. Free hot water is provided - this is how you know it's a legit Chinese place when they bring out hot water instead of ice water as default. I would definitely try their side dishes next time, including spicy pig ears, as well as their tea eggs which are a little pricey at $1.50 each but considering there is no competition in the vincinity, what can we even do about it. One additional issue, I'm not sure if they have a bathroom - I suspect no, which is a slight problem for a restaurant with more than 5 tables serving huge bowls of noodles.> Food is good, service is bad. Tried to order food to go and I asked what's the difference between two chicken dishes. The waitress was impatient about my question and said they taste different. Of course right? Or why they are two different dishes? So I asked for more information, she said she didn't know what's the difference cause she's not the cook. So just ask the cook if you don't know, the kitchen is just two steps away.I was surprised by her attitude and then she said one of the dishes is bigger than another one.

I came across Red White and was intrigued about the uniqueness of a fast-casual vegan Japanese bowl restaurant. I stopped in around 12:30ish and there were two Japanese guys manning the Chipotle-style counter of bases, toppings, etc. You can either get a soup bowl or a non-soup bowl with tofu, udon, or sushi rice. Food: - Humble Bowl (Monk Curry) - Broccoli, Tofu, Corn, Yam potatoes, Green peppers, Edamame, Kale, Arugula, Spinach, Monk curry sauce. I added the vegan spicy mayo on top as well. The bowl was so healthy, packed with very fresh veggies that were all seasoned well and prepared on their own. The scoop of monk curry was on top and had a lot of flavor. It was all very unique and only $10.95 for a whole bowl of fresh veggies! The cold green tea was super legit and strong, I would recommend getting it if you like cold tea. Overall, super cool concept to have fast-casual Vegan restaurant in a cuisine which normally has a lot of fish and pork based foods. Definitely would recommend if you are looking to try something new and healthy!> I wanted to love this place, but alas it fell short of expectations. I got their Buddha ramen, which is one of the newer things on the menu. It was a huge portion (especially for the price of $10.95), and it came with many yummy-looking toppings like corn, meat substitute, and cabbage. However, the taste was quite off - like, not how ramen is supposed to taste. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Santouka broth (I'm also not vegan), but I felt like the broth was much too heavy, a little too spicy, and otherwise lacking compared to the meat-based broths at other ramen places. For vegan ramen, I guess I'm somewhat impressed, but I would most definitely wait in the line for Santouka down the street over coming here for ramen again. Service: 5/5 (the guys working the counter are incredibly nice)Ambience: 5/5 (cute decorations)Price: 5/5 (especially for the huge portions, and it being on Newbury St.)Taste: 2/5 (meh)> This is a small basement dwelling that is brightly decorated with a nice, hand painted Asian feel. It's order at the kitchen fast food style but the food is much better. While there's no table service, the kitchen staff are super friendly, will greet you and guide you through the process if you're obviously a newly.The ""process"" is navigating the main board of build-your-own bowls and broths. Lots of choices but the board guides you through it. I was initially disappointed as I went in for Ramen but then I notice a hand written sign for ramen stuck to the kitchen counter. I'm guessing it's not their forte but I ordered it anyway.The bowl was really good, nice toppings and a flavourful broth. I think it was a miso base as it lacked the creamy goodness of my beloved tonkotsu style. But none the less, excellent, check out my photo.I think I'll try a broth next time, ""stick with what they know"", but their ramen is pretty good too.> This place is adorable, tasty, and healthy! I've had multiple things here and have been pleased with everything I've had across my 3 visits here.All of the vegetables are super-fresh and perfectly cooked. The sauces are unique and really savory. Also, the portions are huge! I often have enough leftovers for a second meal.Finally, having lived in Japan for a year, it delights me no end to go to a spot like this, where the staff greet you enthusiastically when you enter and provide such excellent service (makes me miss eating out in Japan). I recommend!> What a find! I went to dinner with a vegan friend who scouted this restaurant. I had the ""Buddha Ramen"", on special that night. As a recent vegetarian convert I still fantasize about a really good tonkotsu ramen, but this broth was absolutely delicious. Had that nice umami flavor, a rich and complex broth with just enough spiciness. Included cabbage, some vegan ""meat"" substitute, negi, corn, etc. the noodles were quite good.

Although it was national margarita day, I am a big fan of the mojito tinto drink!  SO delicious.  This drink masks the taste of alcohol and is fresh, light, and fruity! Also, PSA- all of their drinks are made with fresh squeezed juice!  Okay so food...Obviously their tacos are great.  I recommend getting at least 3 OR 2 tacos and a side!  My favorite sides are the elotes, corn fritters, and plantains!  As for tacos my favorites are the brussels sprouts and duck!  I'm a picky eater and love the duck so don't be shy!Now dessert.  Get.the.churros.  They are fantastic.  The warm chocolate dipping sauce is heavenly.  I will leave it at that.  Definitely recommend joining the wait list online before you come!  This place gets very busy, even if it's not national margarita day.  The restaurant decor is rustic beachy and they play great music!  I recommend and will be coming back.> Came here as a group of four right when it opened on a Saturday at 11am and we were the first ones there. The space is large and there's all sorts of seating options.We shared an order of plantains and each ordered three tacos for ourselves. I ordered the Tuna Tatako, Pork Belly, and Carnitas tacos on lettuce (lettuce is 25 cents extra, which doesn't make much sense to me but I did it for dietary reasons...). My favorite was definitely the pork belly.While I wasn't exactly full when we left, it was a good experience. The service was friendly and one of the managers was making the rounds and thanking everyone for coming, which was nice.I'd definitely come back again!> This review is for the takeout experience, not dine-in.We came in on a Friday night to get some takeout: large chips and guac, 3 tacos, and a nojito. The place was crowded and we were told a 20 minute wait for the food. Since we were ordering so little, we thought it'd be 20 or less... We were wrong. We waited for like 45 minutes for three small tacos and chips and guac.My drink (nojito) came out probably around 20 mins, it was good tasting and i loved it but the rest of the food wasn't that great.The tacos lacked flavor. We went to squeeze the lime wedge and found that it was only the END of a lime (see photos). We could only use it on one taco. We only liked 1 of the tacos - the middle taco was dry. The large guac was a joke! It was half filled in the cup and this cost $9!! Had it been filled to the brim I wouldnt complain. Guac was also lacking flavor, could've used some lime but we only had the one end piece. The chips were like tostadas that you would buy at the market... Meh.Overall pretty crappy experience for around $22. I gave it an extra star just because the nojito was really good, the star of the meal. Guess that's why its called BARtaco and not TACObar. We won't come back to this spot (unless it's for the drink...).> Bar Taco is a very popular spot in the Seaport, and so there will almost always be a wait time to get in. But trust me, it is worth waiting for! I would say we waited about 30 min. We were given the opportunity to stand at the bar in the meantime. To be honest it was extremely cramped and uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend doing this. I just felt like we were very in the way. Finally after this we were seated in a comfortable booth. Bar Taco offers a family style sit down meal where you are given a piece of paper with menu items listed and everyone at the table checks off what they want. A very convenient way to order. Then everything is sent out on shareable trays. The tacos themselves are really tasty and fresh. I tried a variety and for the price they are definitely worth it. The street corn is also highly recommended, it literally melts in your mouth. Another item worth trying is the plantains. Plantains are one of my favorite side dishes but they have to be made just right. These were perfection and were served with a sauce that complimented them well. For dessert we had churros and Tres Leches. I probably wouldn't order the churros again as they were a bit dry however they nailed the Tres Leches. All in all it's worth stopping in and stuffing your face.> Firstly, thank you  guys for keeping it open at times like this. I always wanted to try bartaco.

The food, drinks, and atmosphere is not only amazing, but the staff also makes sure you're cared for. I came in with a reservation with my boyfriend and we had a wait a short while since there were guests still at our table. But the manager worked with the hostess to get the other guests on their way and later checked in with us to make sure we were satisfied.We shared a Shrimp & Clams Boil, the Dirty Dirty Rice, plus I enjoyed Chocolate Beignets and two ""You Can't Sip With Us."" **Everything** was flavorful, satisfying, and I can't wait to go back for more.> Had a really good meal here.  I ordered the Shrimp Po'boy and Dirty Dirty rice.  I also had the Bourbon Maple Pecan beignets.  I also had a sangria.The decor and atmosphere was what you'd expect in this type of spot.  It was a good social place to grab dinner with friends.  It's not a quiet, boring spot.  The food was good.  I'd go back, but it wasn't good enough to that's I'd prioritize it on my next trip (I go to BOS regularly)Shrimp PoBoy - It was good, with a lot of plain, fried shrimp. I had to eat a bunch of shrimp first to make the sandwich more manageable.  I don't like the sauce typically on there, and they didn't have great hot sauce.  However, they did have a very tasty BBQ sauce.  The fries were the thin ones.  They were good, esp with the sauce, but i prefer thick ones.Dirty Dirty Rice - this was Wally good and very filling for a relatively cheap entree.  I had no business trying to eat all of this AND a sandwich.  I fought the good fight.  This was probably my favorite item from what we ordered.Beignets - I paid the $4 extra to get the Bourbon Maple Pecan version.  They got me.  It was basically the same order with a bit of syrup/ sauce underneath them.  Hardly worth the extra and didn't add that much to the dish.  The syrup wasn't special and you can barely see it in the photo.  It's worth noting that it was an absurd portion size for me after i ate the sandwich, the fries, and most of the dirty rice.  I should have skipped dessert.  It did come with unexpected Ice Cream, which wasn't great since I can't eat dairy like that.The sangria was pretty basic.  Not much to share there.This is a good spot to try.  Not special, but tasty.> (Pre-2/19/2020 - COVID-19 causing restaurants to nix dine-in and either close or change to take-out only)Bootleg Special shortly after 6pm looked pretty full at the bar, and basically empty in the dining room.  But looks can be deceiving, as the hostess noted that due to reservations the next table wouldn't be open for quite some time.Fortunately I managed to find myself a spot for my individual appetite at the bar.  While there are nightly specials at the bar at Bootleg Special, it turned out that Friday is the exception.After eyeing the poboy being consumed to my left, and the braised pork mac & cheese $12 (and mussels) sitting on the bar to my right, I experienced FOMO as I ordered up a fried oyster poboy with shoestring potatoes for $16 for myself.Seven minutes later, the metal platter filled with a bed of thin crispy shoestring fries and the poboy conveniently split in two - each half generously filled with a bed of crunchy fresh cabbage slaw topped with five fat fried oysters drizzled with remoulade sauce and chopped cilantro.  While I was happy to have had it all to my lonesome, I think I would have been all the more satisfied sharing it and an order of their fancified beignets with another.Thoughts for future visits:Souffle Pancakes (repeat)Root 'N Boot Salad $8Garlic Noodles $8, with Shrimp $6Seafood Etouffe $16Fried Shrimp Poboy $15***When you dine for the enjoyment, but realize that you are what you eat, you make it a point to include some vegetables in your meal.  I'm not one for fennel (Brussel Sprouts & Cauliflower, co-starring fennel), so I made a dinner of the Root N' Boot Salad $8 regular/$6 4Play, Garlic Noodles $8/$6 plus shrimp $6, and Garlic Fries $6/$4, and took home some for later.The Garlic Noodles were super good!  But cutting the oil coating the noodles with the salad greens was a good call.  The fries were their crisp shoe string with bits of minced (some a bit raw) garlic cooked up in oil topping it, thought the oil pooled a bit in the bottom of the metal pan.It was nice to find out that their 4Play Menu is still available (Monday - Thursday, 4pm - 7pm with purchase of bar beverage) since the board outside tended to advertise their Daily Bar Specials for Sunday - Wednesday, and Thursday oysters ($1 raw, 3 for $10 grilled).I'm going to have to go back for their Garlic Noodles and shrimp, and give their sweet potato fries a shot.***On a Wednesday night, their Half-off Bar Specials (Sun - Wed, 4pm - 9:30pm) offerings included their Ribs on Coke for $6 (vs $12), so I ordered one of those along with their Garlic Noodles ($6/$8) and Brussel Sprouts & Cauliflower (basil infused rice wine dressing) ($6/$8) off the 4Play Menu (Monday - Thursday, 4pm - 7pm), figuring I've created for myself a rather well rounded meal.I ended up trading a rib for a piece of a neighbor's Easy Street Corn, and despite an order being 4 ribs vs 6 pieces (likely 2 cobs split into 3 apiece), I think I made out the better for it.The corn was yummy, as were the garlic noodles.  The veggies were firm crisp, generous and tasty.  (and lacked the fennel specified in past menus)  But those ribs... the flavor, not to my taste, the texture, tough, and the portion, cut such that the bone was exposed on one side of the rib, and the other side not all that flesh either.I had ordered this once previously, and was taken aback that I would regret ordering it this time.  I guess I ought to have tried either the wings or the chicken skewers off the half price menu, or just gone back to the shrimp add on from my last visit.***Another Wednesday and I decided to step out and to try some new to me items:Braised Pork Mac & Cheese $12/$8 (4Play Menu)Bourbon Chicken Skewers $10/$5 (Wed Half-off)Unfortunately, I regretted both, mainly because the marinade for the pork and the sauce on the chicken just were not to my taste.  The chicken itself was tender and meaty, and just a bit crispy on the edges from the grilling, which I enjoyed.  The mac & cheese was pretty good, but the pork was stringy where the meat had been pulled, however, the chunky bit was a tad less dry.  Once I mixed the cheesey sauce in with the meat though, it was much improved.Definitely going back to the garlic noodles.  Maybe with their street corn or brussel sprouts & cauliflower.  But I'm also still curious about the wings and sweet potato fries...> I came here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Both were delicious and enjoyable experiences. The food: Cajun seafood. Though I enjoyed the side dishes and dessert much more! DinnerBootleg special with bootleg sauce: good sized plate of mixed seafood with sausage, corn, and potatoes. I loved the lobster, shrimp, and clam, but not the crawfish and mussels, maybe tad overcooked on those. Beautiful presentation. The bootleg sauce is VERY HEAVY ON THE GARLIC. I think it's worth a try if it's your first time, but I would've liked a less heavy aftertaste on the sauce. Definitely more than enough for 2 people to share. We had leftovers because we had side dishes and dessert. Speaking of which...Garlic noodles: my husband was skeptical about ordering this at first, but we're both so glad we did. He was asking for my portion near the end. Medium-sized appetizer.Banana foster beignet: LOVE this dessert. I'm a sucker for warm dessert with ice cream. The sauce looks and tastes like a lighter caramel. You get to drizzle the right amount of sauce yourself. Beautiful presentation and what a way to end a meal. BrunchWe came for the Soufflé pancakes! You get three medium sized thick pancakes. Got the banana foster again (other choices are strawberry and chocolate hazelnut). The pancake jiggles which is fun. Comes with tons of whipped cream. I expected the batter to be lighter, but it's still tasty. Mussel bowl in bootleg sauce: again the heavy sauce. I went with a friend who really wanted to try the sauce. Comes with sausages which were dry. Maybe I'll get the lighter white wine sauce next time. The atmosphere: Very unique. Has projectors with old hip hop dance videos cycling, darker feeling with colored lights. I like the vibe the paintings created (see pictures). Reasonably large restaurant. The service: No complaints. All the waiters/waitresses are very nice and pleasant. The wait: Definitely make a reservation ahead of time for weekend brunch -- it gets quite crowded. We came for dinner on a weekday, and the restaurant was maybe only 1/4 full, so no reservations needed there. We were seated right away for our reservation. Food came quickly. Tl;dr: I like the dessert, side dishes, and brunch more than the main seafood. Though I guess you'll have to give the seafood one chance -- hit or miss.> Ohh this place was delicious! I came on a Saturday for brunch and couldn't have been happier. First, I love how it is decorated. Super fun, and the kind of place where you can come casual but also dress up if you'd like! Service was on top of things. We were checked on often and never had to ask for water refills. The drinks are delicious. I ordered the spiked sweet tea which was exactly what I was in the mood for, and had what I think is the perfect amount of sweetness. My boyfriend got the Speed Ball, which has pineapple, coconut milk, and Red Bull because alcohol makes him sleepy and it actually tasted amazing too.For food, we got the Bootleg mussels, fried chicken sandwich, and soufflé pancakes with strawberries. This was the perfect amount of food for two people and we enjoyed everything. The chicken sandwich was a classic done right. Super crispy coating, with a refreshing slaw on top. The mussels.. omg they are a must-order. Super garlicky, perfect amount of spice. You must dip your fries in the juice!! My only small complaint is that there isn't a whole lot of liquid, which means it's very concentrated and therefore super salty. But don't let it go to waste! It's the best part of any mussel bowl. The soufflé pancakes are also amazing - really fun, fluffy, not too heavy or sweet. My boyfriend doesn't usually go for pancakes but he ate one of these. I love the slight eggy flavor, and watching them jiggle! The whipped cream was real, another sign that a restaurant is doing things right.

Light yet packed with flavor, SRV is where we go for dinner, drinks and apps, and late night drinks. The wonderful folks behind the bar are always so friendly and knowledgable, it feels like a privilege for this to be our neighborhood spot (shoutout to John!)Be sure to get one of Chef Meg's desserts, she's always serving up the most surprising combinations (often times mixing in vegetables with sweeter flavors) -- trust me it works!> Made a reservations for 2 at 5:15 pm. It took about 10 minutes to find street parking. We decided to try the arsenale tasting menu. We got:Cicchetti-Salted cod black bread -Olive fritte-Polpette meatballs  -Octopus  Piatti -Lolla rosa salad-Smoked sea trout-RibeyePasta-Rigatoni with oxtail, carrot, broccolini, pecorino-Pasta with snails and mint Dessert-Brownie with kumquat and espresso gelato The cicchetti were all brought out within 3 minutes, which made us feel rushed. However, the rest of the dishes were timed well. The piatti were my favorite, but everything was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and worked well with each other. When we ordered, the server asked for any allergies or aversions. I looked over the dinner menu and informed her I didn't like beets and they made sure no dishes had beets. However, the snail pasta that they served was not listed on the menu. I didn't enjoy the snail texture or taste. I hope in the future they inform you of the dishes on the tasting menu or provide a list of main ingredients they plan on using for the dishes, especially if something is not on the main menu.Overall great experience and I would definitely visit again!> It is a lovely restaurant in many ways, but I was honestly a bit underwhelmed.This a great place if you are into small plates and sharing among friends with glasses of wine, but the food was simply not good enough to stand on its own... I would not visit this restaurant alone. This is a place you should go for the experience with friends and to try something different. I think this is one of few, if not the only, Venetian style restaurants in Boston, but do not go if you are expecting the sort of decadent or comforting meal that one usually associates with all the different types of Italian food. I ordered the Risotto alla Pitocca, and both the potato and the risotto were slightly undercooked, it was edible, but certainly not as enjoyable as it could have been. It was not creamy or well incorporated, the way that I expect a risotto to be. On top of that, and this is possibly just a personal preference, but it was far too lemon-y. I appreciate a squeeze of lemon on a rich dish as this is, but this was overwhelmingly citric in some bites for me. It was particularly annoying as lemon is not listed as being a prominent part of the dish. But again, that could just be a personal preference. Even though it appears that the menu is fairly large, it still feels very limited, especially if you've got food allergies or aversions. There are nuts in almost half the dishes, not many vegan-friendly options, and nothing to offer someone with a more ""conservative"" palate (I realize having to cater to picky eaters is lame, and I am not advocating for a chicken finger option, but perhaps offering a simple pasta dish would help settle the minds of some guests). The Tiramisu is lovely though, and the quality of ingredients is undeniable. The wine list is extensive, but still well-curated. The decor and lighting is cozy and beautiful without being overdone (which is my gripe with a lot of Boston area restaurants). The play fantastic and eclectic music. It is worth going to, certainly. Still, not necessarily among Boston's, or even just Tremont St.'s best.> This restaurant has been on my bucket list for quite some time and I am so happy that we finally got to check it out. Hence, it was only for an after dinner drink, but it was still amazing. Because of the Pandemic with the COVID-19, the South End was a ghost town and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. Plus, it was pretty late too. We ordered an espresso martini for my husband and I had an after dinner drink with Mezcal (can't remember the name). I liked the espresso martini much better, but the ambience set the tone for a romantic evening and a great way to end the night! I can't wait to come back here for a full dinner experience, maybe for my bday in May. Fun fact: SRV stands for Serene Republic of Venice :) Your welcome...lol!> It's white truffle season and the risotto with truffles are dahvine.  A good wine caps the meal.   You can also opt for shavings of truffle to your pasta.  Dude, but you're dining in SRV,  live like a Venetian or Northern Italian and get the risotto with truffles!!    There is an upcharge for the truffle enhancement but well worth the deliciousness if you're a fan of white truffle.     As in visits ago, plates are very Venetian -- simple and fresh, undeniably typical of the area yet modernized.   The chef/owners here know what they are doing.   Paired with good wine and the dining experience at SRV turns out to be refined and enjoyable yet not as expensive as Venice.  I lived in Venice for 3 summers and this place brings me back.Service was a bit disjointed this time with empty plates left on our table for a loooooong time.  I hope it gets better.  Meno una stella .",Null,4.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

I mostly camefor the fries> Inconsistent experiences here. I've come here twice. The first time was pretty good, tasty fries with good sauces for dipping, and I also had a beer which I remember was pretty tasty and cold.The second time most recently I came here with my wife before going out to hang with friends, so we wanted a snack. The fries that we got seemed like it was just the small overcooked bits that get left behind at the bottom of the bag. Not very tasty, didn't look great, and they were all small and half of them burnt to a crisp. We really didn't enjoy them at all, and were thinking the whole time while eating them whether we should send them back, so that detracted from the whole experience.Hesitant to come back here again, and I wouldn't recommend to a friend.> Saus is a tiny and quirky sandwich shop that serves up some interesting sandwiches. The kimchi fried chicken is one of the popular choices and is just the right amount of spicy. The veggie burger with a mushroom patty is also a decent choice. My slight beef with Saus is that the fries are sometimes way too greasy and that's not really acceptable when you charge ~$10/ pop for potatoes! Overall, it's worth a try and one of the better late night options during the weekend. Bonus points for the Tintin memorabilia.> This is an interesting little place. Very limited seating, maybes 5 tables and 2 booths. When we went there was only one booth and service was day. About 5-10 minutes for our food to come out. The sandwiches were ok and the poutine a little overcooked but still nice to eat. I can imagine that after a night out in Boston and a few drinks, this is amazing food because I've been told this is one of the few places that's open late.I would go again if I were in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out.> I've visited Saus a handful times and it's always been great for a some drinks and fries. However, this last time was a big letdown. My husband and I were in the city and just wanted a snack before our dinner so we came to Saus purely for the fries. Our fries were like the crumbs at the bottom of your chip bag that you don't want to eat, but you eat it anyways because you paid for it kinda feeling. I wouldn't mind if the small fries tasted like the typical fresh and crispy fries, but these were like 50/50 chance of eating an extra crispy and overly fried oily fry.

We had a wonderful date night, and all the food arrived perfectly and tasted amazing. The focaccia was absolutely out of this world: so moist and flavorful (not to mention how amazing it smelled) and with a delicious cheese! Honestly I would have ordered two of these. The brussels and burrata appetizers were also so good. For entrees, the pork milanesa came with an incredible sauce and salad, and the combination was way better than I expected. The pasta with boar Bolognese was quite light on the sauce, but still very tasty. Overall, such an delightful evening, I'm definitely coming back in person!> I have very mixed feelings about Fox And The Knife...We made a reservation about a month in advance, and the only time we could get for a table of four was 9:15. Not a big deal as it was a Saturday night, and we had hoped that a later reservation meant it would be less crowded. I was totally wrong. We got there 9:15 on the dot and the place couldn't have been more packed, it was elbow to elbow in the bar area. We didn't get seated until around 9:40 (I was not too happy that they didn't check in on us at all/provide updates), and were placed in a small high top that was very tight for 4 people. The hostess and waitress were very nice, said they would send us out some goodies for the wait, etc. Now the food was very very good, every bit as good as I keep hearing/reading. We ordered the focaccia & brussel sprouts, the luna & taglatelle (from pasta section), and the pork milanese & scallops (from the secondi section), to share. Everything was delicious particularly the luna & the pork milanese, both so light yet intensely flavored (it must be magic). Curiously I didn't think the focaccia was anything super special, given that's the one thing everyone raves about. Ours arrived kind of cold maybe that's why? Oh yes, we also had a salad, which was the ""goodies"" they said they would send.... One funny thing is everything we ordered pretty much came in 3 pieces. We weren't really bothered but it would have been nice if our waitress had mentioned it and asked if we wanted to add an extra piece or something. It made sharing a little hard. Anyway, we also ordered pretty much all of the desserts on the menu and some wine, and they were quite yummy as well. As you can see, I have no issues with the food or drinks, loved everything we had and would absolutely go back. I just really don't love the elbow to elbow trying to squeeze yourself in and make space for the waitstaff to maneuver kind of environment. It's awesome that they are doing well, and some things (like guests lingering) are not really within their control. But maybe better planning/spacing out reservations further, or limiting the amount of people that can be at the bar, would help. I want to go back, but will wait until the hype dies down a bit.> If you're in the mood for small plate pasta dishes that'll rock your erogenous zones, buckle up. Every dish is fair game-- open season! The Fox and it's team are high achievers-- so come ready.First, lemme insist the following... I'm not a ""yelp guy"", but I digress. Imagine the delivery and choice in tapas style dining, combined with human portions that don't leave you feeling delicate. It's breathtaking, really; more should try it. Similar to others in their weight-class, the order is placed in full and they'll be parceled appropriately. The difference with The Fox is that you almost want them to slow down. Every course is so GD special that you'll need a minute to reflect on what happened. The Blitzkrieg should start with a salad of sorts-- they're all perfect. Worth noting-- the insalata verde has a citrus vinaigrette that felt like it was painted on with a fine point brush. So fun! For pastas-- it's really disturbing. There are no salt shakers for a reason. If you don't think it's perfect, leave the way you entered. The fettuccine w boar Bolognese and Pep Cacio are again-- FUN! At this point, you're ready to be done. Ha, Sorry! (Secondi enters stage Left) Think again! You're in for it... And in comes the Milanese di Maiale--crispy pig cutlet, topped with vibrant honeycrisp apples and greens... all of which are parked on a bed of saffron aioli to help grease the track. This is a tough dish to approach. On one hand, you wanna respect and enjoy it. On the other, you wanna hollow it out and finish strong. What The Fox does is admirable, and they should be super proud. The one thing that's different (and this may be a positive) is that they carry a cordial license. Every drink is great-- but when the food taps into your animal spirit, the glass ceiling of a cordial cocktail doesn't hit at the same speed as the dishes. (Id go wine for that reason.)12/10 Absolute rockstars.> According to eater.com labels this spot one of America's best new restaurants of 2019, but my trip there didn't blow me away. Sure, the food was good, and the atmosphere was bustling, but there wasn't any singular dish that blew me away, and there were a few that were on the disappointing side. By no means was it a bad meal, but I'm not dying to go back either. If this was one of best new restaurants of 2019, it was a pretty mediocre year. The dishes that were hyped up to us didn't live up to expectations. Disappointing, but not terrible.> DINNER REVIEWWOW! Just WOW! I had heard good things about Fox & The Knife but I've also heard good things about other new restaurants and I've been disappointed. Not here! This was one of the best meals I've had in Boston and I can't wait to come back.WAIT: We went right when it opened and beware that the bar before the dining room does so we had to wait about 15 minutes. No big deal and I imagine that many of you will not be going right when it opens so check with others about prime time wait. Also something to consider: it's kind of isolated so if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait, not the best area to come for restaurantsFOOD: This is what we came for...when I took a look at the menu, it was short, especially for an Italian restaurant, but I LOVE short menus (I always do). It means they specialize and focus on making a few good things really good. That said, I think I could have ordered every thing on the menu and been very happy...each element of each dish was clearly intentional and there for a reason.It was only two of us so we didn't order too much but here is what we got:Focaccia Taleggio - ""$12 for focaccia?!"" you're probably thinking. But this isn't just homemade buttery focaccia (which alone would be worth it!). This is a FANCY grilled cheese with amazing melted cheese in the middle. This is a must-get! Better yet, get a couple!Harissa Braised Agnello - I am not a big pasta person so I went with this. This was a beautiful, tender, fall off the bone lamb shank over some delicious carrot polenta and top with mint gremolata. My only wish: That I ordered another.Pistachio Ice Cream Sandwich - My goodness, this off-menu dessert item is a MUST GET. I mean, you have to like pistachio but even if you do a little, GET IT. It's pistachio ice cream between these thin waffle cookies and then dipped in chocolate that has hardened and is drizzled with pistachios. It all held together really well which makes me think they assembled it beforehand. I think it's better that way because it's not too messy.Run, do not walk, to Fox & The Knife!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

If asked to order from Dig again, I'd probably ask to order Sweetgreen instead as they have more menu options and add-on options available on each order. Only a 3/5, probably wouldn't be a must have choice of mine when ordering on the future.> The food here is on point if you are looking for a healthy lunch that isn't just another salad bowl. Price is around $10-$12 if you are getting a classic protein bowl (includes 1 main, 1 protein, 2 sides, and sauce). The herb roasted chicken is juicy and always well cooked.  I honestly haven't disliked anything I have gotten here!They are also a great option for catering or family meal options! A bit on the pricey side but if you are looking for a healthy, well cooked meal out/in this is the spot!They are on Ubereats!> They changed the name to DIG and the quality has gone down significantly The place has a  different vibe now There was 1 person ahead of me and maybe 2 in the dine in area Very different from my past experiences Stopped in last night  and I ate what I got because I was hungry but it was FAR from good I was very very disappointed because in the past I could count on always getting some delicious healthy and filling food Last nights meal truly didnt hit any of these Sad to say I don't see  going back  there again and I live close to this location!> **My visit was two years ago**When I came here, I had been a vegetarian for about a year and I honestly was pretty pessimistic that any of the meatless options would fill my stomach up. I was wrong! I got tofu as my protein and a bunch of different sauces on the side. Service was quick and the prices were not too bad. The interior of the restaurant was clean and modern and I liked that the natural light flowed in through the windows.

This guy can cook traditional Turkish fare like no other. Great job every time, now with a new Ali Baba in Charlestown and free parking!! Love it.> Ali Baba is a Turkish restaurant that is a bit off the beaten path at the edge of South End.  So it wasn't too surprising that it was quiet during our weekend lunch visit.Since the chef wasn't scheduled to arrive till noon, their version of pizza -  the pide - was out of the question, but everything else was available.  So, six of us shared the following:Falafel appetizer $7 for 6 crispy flat piecesKotfa Kebab $15 reg plate (Turkish meatballs) 4 hunksChicken Chops $16 reg plate (chicken thighs) 3 flattened portionsLamb Shish Kebab $18 reg plate (cubes of lamb) 3 skewersChicken Shish Kebab $16 reg plate (chunks of white meat chicken) 3 skewers+hummus $2+babaganoush $2(a max of two dips for $2 apiece could be added to a plate:hummus, tabulih, babaganoush, spicy vegetable dip, labni - save your bread for this)Kunefe $7Their entrees come sized in small or regular, served with bulgur, salad and homemade bread.  Ours were all regular portions, since we would be sharing, and we happened to order just enough for our appetitesEverything was good, but I preferred the dark chicken over the white, and the kofte a tad over the lamb cubes.  We felt the meats to be more strongly seasoned over the chicken, in a good way.  The falafel was good here with a nice crisp crust.  Though it would have been better with a flatbread, but still I enjoyed the two spreads we picked with ripped pieces of the homemade bread.The kunefe took 15 minutes, and was sweet, yet not overly so, with the honey water.  The savory cheese was mild yet added a nice tenderness in contrast to the crisp phyllo strings.  We were full, so a bite apiece was just about perfect.Service was pleasant, even though we kept interrupting her for water, for another plate, for spoons, etc.  And she ran after us in the rain to return the credit card we had accidentally left behind.> Are you hungry, but it's already midnight and Boston is shutting down? No worries! Ali Baba is here for you (until 3:15 or 4:15 am, depending on the day). AND, it's food you would want to eat no matter what time it is (unlike a lot of those other late night eateries). I've had a few different things here and they've all been incredible. Fresh and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend the lamb kebab (split between two people if you get the regular size). It comes with a fresh salad, delicious bread, and a flavorful bulgur (grain kind similar to rice).  There's some seating inside if you'd like to sit, or they also have relatively rapid takeout and delivery options.> A really cute family owned business with delicious and reasonably priced food! We got the Adana Kebab and the Doner, with papaganoush as a side. Both were absolutely delicious! The meat was juicy and flavorful, the rice (we asked our waiter what it was but I forgot) was hearty, and both even come with a roasted pepper that was quite an adventure (if you like spicy). I recommend stopping by if you're looking for great Turkish food for cheap!> Super delicious food, make sure you order the lamb lamachun and the chicken mixed grill.

The food and drinks were delicious and our server was attentive. We got the chicken liver parfait and the duck for starter and both were amazing. We then got the mussels and the fries and the fries was really good but the mussels were just fine. They were still good don't get me wrong but everything was amazing up until that point so we had the same expectations for the mussels.I would definitely go back and try some of the other things on the menu> Yes!   Was told this place was an amazing and it didn't disappoint!Started with the cheese puffs, escargot and the cheese... wow!!!For a main, couldn't resist the Le Burger.... Le Wowwwwww!  So good. Mussels and the tagliatelle also on the must eat list. Thx Boston for my little trip to France !> Our dinner last night was one of the best meals we've have ever had (there were 4 of us)  in Boston (we are from NYC). We had the double Duck Confit appetizer, gougères, Mussels, Beef Borgionon, Poulet Chasseur and Steak au Poivre. They were all completely authentic and incredibly satisfying and delicious. The Cabernet Sauvignon was perfect and we had several glasses, as was a cocktail my husband ordered and I cannot recall the name.  For desert we tried the chocolate mousse, we were split on that, some loved the salty addition and the dark chocolate nibs some didn't. The creme caramel was also a little underwhelming but nice. Be careful though the bread is to die for and when you run out, they charge 1.00 a slice which seems a bit cheap but believe me they are doing you a favor and helping to leave room for the food. The atmosphere is très Parisian and very comfortable. Even though totally packed, not terribly noisy. The severs and especially our waiter were so attentive and charming while carrying huge cast iron dishes, and pots.  Really sweet people including the lovely hostess.The only complaint was the male bartender. He was so incredibly rude and unwelcoming that we nearly walked out the door before our table was ready, So glad we didn't. it's too bad, the experience would have been 100% perfect if the bartender wasn't such a DB.> At the recommendation of the host I got the Lyon Classic: Quenelle de Brochet. The sauce was so buttery and savory. The dumpling was soft and satisfying. Would highly recommend to share. And there's an abundance of sauce so save your bread to dip!> Celebrated NYE here and let me tell you it was the best meal of the year! We started off with some cocktails and then ordered duck confit, (so tender the meat fellRight off the bone), chicken liver parfait and onion soup. Everything was excellent we couldn't wait to order the main meal. Perusing over the menu where everything looks phenomenal, but also thinking the appetizers did fill us up a bit, we ended up splitting the Beef bourguignon.  If you have never had this dish, I highly suggest coming to Bar Lyon to check it out amongst other incredible dishes. For desert we had macaroons and a custard (similar to flan). My new favorite French restaurant and I know we'll be back to taste some other dishes as well.

Fries were fine.The bar itself is not too big. we grabbed a spot near the front at a table and pretty much kept to ourselves. We quickly got our food and pints from the bartender, although most of us barely finished the pints. Nothing was wrong with them, we just couldn't stomach any more beer! Then we all ate in silence as we devoured our food.Thanks for the wind-down to our night!> my first time in Boston and after that 4hours++ bus ride from NYC my sister was starving. this place happens to be located just across our hotel and my sister was craving fries hence we just went it. everything about this place turned out so much better than expected! great ambience! casual, chill, and relaxed. amazing and very pleasant service too! the guy was really amiable and he was attentiveI ordered Portobello Sammy, my sister got the Fourth Wall Grilled Cheese Sandwich and we shared the Lobster and Corn Chowder..- the Lobster Chowder was amazing! it has the most generous pieces of lobster I've ever had in a chowder and the crouton was actually corn bread, which blends really well- both sandwiches came with massive amount of fries. I switched mine to sweet potato fries. Fluffy brioche bun, sharp savory cheese, the portobello has strong acidic taste to it.. Overall it was really good. the sweet potato fries has amazing texture but both fries were kind of bland for unknown reason. there were so much fries we had to pack the leftovers to go. they'll make a good bus ride snack I suppose.for the quality of the food, the size, service, and atmosphere I think they charge decently and was well worth it.. it was overall a very enjoyable lunch> Tried this place out on a weeknight before heading to a show at the Wang Theater. It's a weird mix between a lively bar and restaurant but I appreciate the effort at a nice full menu in a place like this. I had a couple gin and tonics which were quite good and strong. Their menu is limited but has some really nice dinner options. I chose the hanger steak cooked medium. It arrived quickly but was overdone and chewy. The side of street corn was just okay. My partner's meal was also mediocre (burger). Our waiter was exceptionally nice. He was trying his best but it became too busy for him to keep up with tables. It took a while for the second round of drinks. After the meal he initially brought back a bill which was not ours. We waited patiently for him to return the correct bill which charged us for an extra we never had. We sucked it up, paid and got out of there. Overall great people with great intentions. It's just not working yet.> Very good. Went here for lunch today. We got there at the perfect time because it really filled up. I had the burger and a salad. No complaints but the burger could have been cooked a little longer for medium. If you're really picky about your red meat I would have them cook it longer than usual. The sweet potato fries were also a hit! The service was very friendly and the food came out relatively fast. I would definitely stop in here for lunch!> We were looking for a casual spot to get burgers and beers and this spot was perfect. You can expect all the classics of a bar menu.

The short rib poutine is a must, as are the french toast and burgers. One time I had the fruity pebble pancakes which looks amazing but were a total miss, the cereal glaze or whatever it's called was bland and too thick. Besides that though, everything I've ordered has been great.The vibe is alive and buzzy. Mostly the young professional crowd which is the norm for Southie. Wait times on the weekend can be long, put your name on the list in advance if you can't get a reservation.> I was so excited to try this place out! I had an hour to kill before heading somewhere else in South Boston, so I did some research and decided to meet a friend at Lincoln Tavern. The reviews were so good! And I've already been to Capo a few times, so I wanted to try something new. What a disappointment!My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I got an espresso martini which came out with some kind of powder on top - a lot of it. Have you ever heard of the cinnamon challenge? Not good. I then ordered the margherita pizza and was saddened by the lack of flavor. I mean look at the pic... that's exactly what it tasted like. Bland AF. They didn't even offer chili flakes or parmesan to spice it up. I could have asked, but that leads me to my 2nd gripe...The bartenders seemed nice, but were absent. We got our order in right away, but then I had to ask twice for water. Then, our food came and no one stopped by to ask how the food was or if we needed anything else (like something to give the pizza flavor...). We were done eating when they thought to come by and see if we wanted another drink. No thanks.It was a Wednesday night at 6 PM and the restaurant was full, but not crowded (which it sounds like this place can get later at night and on weekends). Not sure what happened here because the same group owns Capo down the block and they have good food (come to think of it - their pizza was underwhelming too - my bad) and great drinks. How can Capo's espresso martini be wonderful and Lincoln's be so dreadful? Same owners - same block! I don't know. I'd like to give this place another chance. My friend did like his tacos and the brunch reviews are good. If I come back and have a better experience, I'll update my review. Until then ""Meh. I've experienced better"" sounds like the right rating to me.> I want to like Lincoln.The food has been consistently good, to be honest it's one of the best burgers I have had the pleasure of eating. Yet, the good food cannot undo the fact that every time I'm there I am transported to a college frat party. I've gone three times, all at different times of day, and without fail the place is jam packed with people loudly sloshing beer, yelling at the football games, and generally being inconsiderate of other patrons. The most recent time there was no different, except for the fact that the food was mediocre at best while the first two times it was excellent. I had the shortribs on top of a very salty truffle mac n cheese (could not finish it, far too rich) while my fiancee ate a burger that looked almost raw (she ordered it medium). Maybe try going at an off time, lunch on a weekday perhaps. If you want to brave a weekend then if sticky floors and screaming over your food is your thing, by all means go. We'll opt for something else next time.I really do want to like Lincoln, the food is usually great but the atmosphere is so unbearable that it ruins the meal.> Lincoln Tavern was one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to + it was a perfect spot for football Sunday! The food is above average and the bar has a nice vibe - there are TVs everywhere for you to watch the games. Our group loved it!We started with spicy wings and a plain pizza - both were fabulous. Our table got the steak burrito and burgers for entrees - also delicious. They give you huge portions on all the food so be sure to come here hungry!The service was good despite it being extremely packed for the football games. I definitely recommend making a reservation as we did have to wait a half hour for a table. Regardless, it wasn't an issue as the bar was a blast!Next time I'm back in Boston, I certainly will be heading here again! Highly recommend.> Lincoln continues to deliver my favorite brunch! Their hash browns call to me every weekend. It's always crowded so get there early. Get at least one of these when you go:- hash browns- spicy Bloody Mary- wheat toast- fruit bowl.

I wanted to try an authentic lobster roll with some clam chowder and this place did not disappoint! Service was super friendly and helpful at the counter when I felt confused by the menu. The place is small so there is only about 3 tables inside, so I think it's more for take-out orders. I ordered the ""Standahd"" ($30, worth it) lobster roll with a bowl of ""Chowdah"" ($8) as it's written on the menu, and there were both amazing. They did NOT skimp one the lobster (see pic) since it was literally overflowing and falling out of the bread.I am coming back to this place every single time I need a lobster roll now!!> In town for a shoot and decided to order with them on Uber Eats. You always expect a hit or miss expect slowly when you are ordering high end Seafood and I have to say this restaurant has not disappointed and I have already ordered from them twice.I ordered the 6 1/2 ounce lobster roll with warm drawn butter and I have to say it is the first time I have ever ordered a lobster roll and was absolutely stuffed by the time I got finished: I do think that it is a bit pricey at almost $27 however it is absolutely packed with large chunks of lobster meat the bread was soft warm and toasted challah bread with a slightly sweet taste which is wonderful with the savory lobster. I also ordered the clam chowder which I have to say was extra thick creamy load it with clams a little too much potatoes for my personal liking however excellent as a meal all by it's self. I also had an order of the Lobster Mac n Cheese. Being from the south I would have to say I was slightly disappointed in this I'm not sure what kind of cheese is used on this but it seems like more of a cheese sauce and was certainly lacking any seasoning however it did have large lumps of lobster meat. So on a scale of 1 to 5.. 5 being excellent I would give it a 3. Overall, clearly I thought this was a great establishment I have now ordered from them twice and I have only been in town three times and I have also recommended them to some of my crew members.> Over a couple of visits I had the opportunity to try several items off the menu of Lobstah on a Roll.This shop is located on a corner in the South End.  You order at the counter and have a dine in option at the counter by the window, but when the weather is nice, there are also a few tables set outside off the sidewalk.The chalkboard lists their menu, but for the market price of their lobster you can find that on the menu placed on the counter.The staff is friendly, and for the undecided, samples of their soups are available.  A bathroom is available up the stairs.The clam chowder (New England style of course!) $6/$8 is made fresh daily  It tasted great!  That is, with the exception of the large dice firm celery, since I personally do not prefer the taste of these green fibrous stalks.  Their lobster bisque $8/$12, served with a few teaspoons of meat scooped first into the bowl, however, may be one of the best I've had the pleasure of tasting.  I enjoyed the flavor and the rich creaminess.  Just be careful as there might be chips of shell clinging to the lobster meat.Crab Cakes come two to an order for $16 with little filler but made of well shredded meat.  I prefer lumps in mine and found these a little salty on their own.New England Tacos $16 (3 soft tacos stuffed with lettuce, lobster, cilantro mayo and a roasted corn and mango salsa) were a bit messy wet to consume, but sufficed for a meal.  The salsa was refreshing, but the meat a bit light a portion of fresh delicate lobster.There's the option of adding lobster meat to your dish at 3 oz portions, market price.  Their cold was tasty and delicate.  The hot was well flavored, but the additional cooking firmed up the meat somewhat.  My mom preferred the cold due to the consistency, but I enjoyed the flavor of both.During an October visit, their market prices were:Bostonian 4 oz $19.99Standahd 6 oz $26.95Two if by Sea 12 oz $49.99Big Papi (4 rolls 6 oz ea) $99.99> First and foremost, I love the people that work at this place. I'm definitely a tourist, and so the cashier showed me all the places to go in Boston and recommended me all the places to eat in Boston. I've never had someone take time out of their day to give me such a start to finish great customer service. I honestly would just go back to talk with that lady because she was so sweet and so nice. I would definitely asked to see their list of Boston places to go to if you're a tourist!Now onto the food, oh my God. Do you see the amount of meat you get! They are definitely not skipping out and it would be a travesty if you did not go to this place. I think I am a person that loves more mom and pop shops rather than commercialized places. Therefore I believe that you should definitely put this place on your list if you're coming to visit. I ordered the Bostonian but I can imagine that everything else on their menu is just as great!> Bought over $200 worth of lunch menu food here (which, as it turns out, is not much food when their lobster rolls are $30 per person (the two person sandwich was $60! and not all that big). The menu felt a bit deceiving: many of the items on the menu were overtly advertised; there were a few that were not. We should have asked about prices, but we wrongly assumed they'd be similarly priced to the other items. The rolls themselves were kind of awful. The lobster was mixed with a bland mayo and the lobster was gummy. Hot dog buns for bread. Small kid sandwich is $28. Lobster tacos (you get two) are $16 and really tiny.

They're not one of the top restaurants in Boston for nothing. Unfortunately if you dine here as a couple you will be sharing a table with strangers which will be the only unpleasant thing about your dining experience. We came right as they opened their doors so half of the restaurant was empty but they still seated my party of two at a larger table and had us share it with another couple. As long as you only care about the food, it's a solid 5/5. I first visited this establishment 3 years ago and thought it was good but nothing special. I made my second visit approximately 1 month ago and basically loved everything we ordered. I have a tendency to over-order but with Gourmet having such a large menu, it's hard not to. Their soup dumplings are plump and full of delicious, flavorful soup. The Szechuan wonton with chili oil was a refreshing dish due to the cucumber and carrots that accompanied the wontons. The chili oil is a tasty mixture, however, it is lacking in heat. The wontons were solid. The Sandong style pan fried dumplings with pork & shrimp were good but I would have liked them more if they were even crispier. Each of our dumpling dishes came with their own dipping sauce. You will have to ask for chili sauce because they don't keep any condiments at the table. The scallion pancakes were perfect! Crispy and delicious. My boyfriend and I are going through a phase where we are obsessed with salt & pepper chicken wings and calamari so we had to order them. Everything was seasoned well and fried to perfection. Both the chicken wings and calamari sit on a bed of iceberg lettuce to add a different texture and balance out the saltiness. I love that the chicken wings were also seasoned with that special Chinese seasoning on top of the salt & pepper that really just enhances the whole dish. We definitely had to get a few to-go boxes but our overall lunch experience was super yummy!> Review for Delivery/To-Go experience. Ordered: -juicy pork dumplings (Xiao long bao)-mapo tofu-beef wrap-Taiwan rice came Juicy pork dumplings were definitely juicy! Be sure to pick these up very carefully and with a spoon under so as to not break the skin and allow the treasured soup to come oozing out and wasted! Highly recommend this order :) Mapo Tofu was the most underwhelming of my order. The tofu and the sauce just seemed completely separate with the tofu tasting as if it had just come out of its box and hadn't been cooked with the sauce :( I am hopeful that after my leftovers have had a day of sitting, the flavor will be there today. Beef wrap was solid! Very oily and fried, just the way it's supposed to be. There is beef and cilantro inside, creating a delicious taste. Taiwanese rice cake was spot on. With a variety of veggies and some meat, you get the perfect mixture of chewy and crunchy. I would recommend this order.A nice lady answered the phone for my pick up order and everything went very smoothly! The food was delivered to me pretty quickly (in less than 35 minutes). I'll likely be ordering from them again or going to the restaurant to eat in person (after this whole coronavirus situation is over).> Packed in this little restaurant like sardines. Does that matter? Absolutely not!Gourmet Dumpling House is faulted by... nothing (unless you watched the news in October, but that's another story). Stepping in on a cold winter day, after waiting fifteen minutes outdoors for a table, we were greeted to piping hot tea at a small table. That set the mood for the remainder of the service: warm, friendly, and homey.We started our meal with shared udon noodles, followed by a triage of fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, and soup dumplings.I'll be honest: the pan fried weren't my favorite. Perhaps the heat was too low, but biting into the dumpling was like a bomb of hot oil in my mouth, like it had absorbed all the oil in the pan. Unappetizing.The remainder? Excellent. The udon noodles, which came out three minutes after ordering, were perfectly tender and full of flavor. The melt-in-your-mouth pork, tender mushrooms, and whatever sauce came on the noodles was delectable. For as quick as it came out, this dish was packed with flavor.The juicy pork dumplings were the star of the show; edible pillows full of bone-warming soup that put a smile on my face immediately. These dumplings are special, and are made with a great deal of care. The broth in these soup dumplings is  incredibly rich, and supports the ground pork dumpling expertly.If you're willing to wait, this is the place to be.> Stopped by on a rainy Boston Saturday. It was around 2:30pm. This place was crazy. Crazy busy. We stepped on in and the hostess quickly took us to our two person table. The table was awkwardly set up in a corner right in front of a door and right beside the fish tank. It was very crowded inside so it was really hard to move around. We didn't mind our table though and were actually glad that we were seated right away. We had like three different servers and for the longest time we just sat there with no one coming to get our orders. When they finally did, we ordered: Dumplings, chicken with broccoli, and crab ragoons. Oh and a side of white rice since it's not included with the entree. The food was good but in my opinion nothing special. It was very plain and lacking flavor. Soy sauce was my best friend here.  Our waitresses disappeared agent they brought us our food and so we were never checked on or asked if we needed anything. Paid about $35 worth of food. The service sucked and the food was just ok. As we sat there someone actually tried opening the door that was right behind my chair and ended up hitting me with the knob.. They then made there way thru and didn't even apologize.. rude> Luckily got seated right away as this place almost always has a line going out the door. Seats are tightly packed together so personal space is limited as they try to fit as many people in as possible (potentially too many). Had the beef tendon, mini juicy dumplings with pork, salt and pepper tofu, and Szechuan fish soup with 2 bowls of rice. This was my first time trying the beef tendon and I thoroughly enjoyed how flavorful it was and how it was served cold. The mini dumplings were good but had to ask for vinegar as there was only soy sauce on the table. The tofu had a perfect crispy layer served with a tasty oyster based sauce. The fish smelled intoxicating and tasted even better. Typically I try to avoid Szechuan as it can be easily overbearing but this was perfect. Definitely not a soup that you can sip on but very good served over white rice as a sauce. Will come back if the line isn't crazy.",Null,3.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

The 2 dishes we got were SO fresh and delicious and I love their large menu selection! The potstickers were totally not worth it though - they tasted like frozen grocery store dumplings.> 3.5 stars. Shun kitchen is a decent spot if you are looking for an Asian restaurant that you can take people too with better ambiance than the typical chaotic, loud setting that you get from restaurants in Chinatown.Sun's offers an expansive menu for Chinese, Japanese and Thai food. I had a chance to have their tempura and crispy noodles pad Thai and the dish were decent. Both dishes were, however, not authentic by any means. There were more Americanized version..and tasted ok (standard...nithing like wow..Mir nothing that tasted bad either). The portion is quite big, so if you want to try many dishes, it's best to bring your dining companions along.Service was courteous. I was there for weekend lunch and it wasn't crowded at all (just a few tables of customers). But perhaps this place is more crowded in the evening.> Great atmosphere with very kind servers. The sushi was outstanding for the price. I will definitely come back for more sushi. The noodles are average but not bad at all> I'm a regular here. Excellent service and the food is really good. I always get hot and spicy soup.> Our go-to spot for Chinese or sushi in the city. We live a few blocks away. The service is always fast and very polite. They have a very large menu so whether folks in your party want traditional chinese, asian-american favorites, or good sushi, everyone will be happy. The sashimi and sushi is always fresh and never smelly. We always get the dumpling soup-- love the clear noodles! Only thing I ever didn't like was the crunchy pad thai, not my jam, but it wasn't bad quality or anything. Price is great, drinks are strong!",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null
Null,Cantonese,No,Null,Null,Null,Null,$ ,No,Clay Pot Cafe,Null,"4, 5, 4, 3, 5","Tiny no frills restaurant with a lot of hearty, delicious Chinese food to offer. The food:Chinese sausage clay pot (3.5/5): Large, steaming portion of fried rice with bits of mushroom and Chinese sausage mixed in. Very satisfying to eat, but seems like something I could make at home. Next time would opt for the more unique choice of yellow eel. Pork dumplings (4/5): Not much filling, but what's there of it is really good! Solidly above average. Oxtail with Herbal Soup (4.5/5): Authentic. Bitter and packed with herbal, earthy flavor. Felt like I was being cleansed from the inside out, but slightly painful to drink at the end when all the bitter sediment concentrated to the bottom. Great hole-in-the-wall establishment. Please consider visiting them during the COVID-19 crisis, if you are able! Would be a perfect time to get that herbal soup, ya know.> I wanted to give this spot a shot since I was getting bored of hitting up my usual spots. Very old school, no frills, hole in the wall location. Either way, I got the yellow eel claypot and the Shanghai nian gao (rice cakes) because I was doing an intermittent fasting challenge (doing it every other day is a difficult act to pull off). The waiter suggested that I just roll with the claypot but I affirmed that I wanted the rice cakes too. The Shanghai nian gao was decent with the right amount of sauce to provide flavor for the rice cakes, but they weren't mindblowing. However, the claypot was the real crown jewel with excellent proportions for the eel and rice. The dish was also perfectly seasoned for a pleasant dining experience. The real treat at the end is all the crispy rice that is chilling on the bottom for you to dig in to your heart's content. Cash only establishment, but definitely worthy of a trip.IG: Mood4foodeatery> Note: Cash only (and they also charge tax)! We ordered the dumpling appetizer, which I would actually not recommend. They weren't bad by any means, but they were a fairly bland flavor. We ordered the chicken and sausage and the beef and egg clay pot. The chicken and sausage was good - not too salty, but the amount of meat seemed sparse. The beef and egg was really saucy, and I would recommend that over the chicken and sausage clay pot. For $8 in Boston though, really not a bad deal, and you get what you pay for. The clay pot is a surprisingly decent amount of food and was more than filling enough and for us to take home a little bit as well.> The clay pot is okay. I do like the concept, but the favors are a little bland. We ordered the eel Clay pot and spare rib clay pot. Both came out steaming hot and looked delicious. They both had onions, scallions, rice and a little hint of soy sauce. The eel tasted frozen and soft like mushrooms. It was moist and a bit Chewy. The spare ribs was small in size and had more bones , then meat on it. We also got the curry fish balls , which was so bland and the curry sauce was watery. It was about $20 something for the meal. It's CASH ONLY and service was fine. Not sure, if I would come back . It's worth a try> Clay pot rice is a childhood nostalgic favorite and this place makes it the traditional way. Many people complain there's not enough meat, but the best part is the rice. The crunch on the bottom they is! Otherwise it's just claypot meat hah! But it's very family-oriented and owned. Any other vegetable noodle or soup orders feels like home-cooked. Try something newMy go to: - chicken mushroom sausage clay pot rice, ask for an egg on top too! - garlic bok Choy - black chicken soup (very herbal) Many order the yellow eel.

Null,"Ramen, Soup, Noodles",Yes,Null,Null,Null,Null,$$ ,No,Santouka Back Bay,Null,"5, 4, 4, 5, 4","I came right on time when there wasn't a long line outside (and it wasn't that cold out). We were told it would be around 15 minutes, but we only waited about 10 minutes. There are about 16 seats total - you'd definitely be sitting next to a stranger. I'm not a fan of ramen, but my boyfriend is so I like Santouka (the one in Cambridge) because I would order the salmon over rice with appetizers while he orders ramen. But they didn't have appetizers here so I gave ramen a try anyways. I ordered the Goma Miso Ramen and it ended up being really good! I don't go for ramen because it's too heavy for me, but this small bowl of ramen was just perfect. The broth wasn't too thick but flavorful and the noodles weren't chalky. My boyfriend ordered the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen and he said he liked it more than the Santouka in Cambridge. My meal also came with butter and corn which tasted like butter and corn so don't be expecting something amazing. What I really love is how perfect the egg is! It was the perfect soft boiled egg, just drizzle a little soy sauce on top and it was great! Overall, a great meal! Definitely quick though if you start feeling bad for the line forming outside the door. I would definitely stop by again if I'm in the area/there isn't a long line outside.> I was on a hunt for some good ramen and was ended up here after a friend strongly recommended it. The store was tiny and I was seated after a good 15-20 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient (which was greatly appreciated). The only annoying thing was that I had to constantly get up while enjoying my meal so that people could squeeze in (since the space was so tight). The ramen itself was above average. Broth was nice and rich. Serving portion was highly generous. Noodles were cooked just the perfect amount. I also got the cha-shu rice bowl as part of the combo meal. In retrospect, I could have gone without the extra rice. But if you do order the rice bowl, I recommend adding a couple drops of the chili oil to enhance the flavor! Ramen: 8/10> Great stop to curb your ramen craving! Went on a sunday at 4:30 and waited in line outside for 20 minutes (about 10 people in front of us). Once seated the service was quick. The food came in about 5 minutes and it did not disappoint!Dishes ordered: -  Shio ramen combo large + Chashu Gohan+ Ajitama - Shio ramen combo regular + Three Takumi + Ajitama Pros: - broth was rich and creamy- Thick cubes of Chashu in the rice bowl- Three Yakumi great addition to the ramen bowl- Noodles were a good consistency (chewing yet soft) Cons: - The Chashu slices could be a little more juicy (was on the dryer side) - The tea egg could have a little more taste (just me being picky) Verdict:- Good place to satisfy your ramen craving. I left content and decently full. I did not find the broth to be too salty and the portion size was just enough to satisfy me. Recommendations: - Highly recommend getting the combo as just the ramen bowl might not be enough to fully satisfy you. Also an egg with ramen is a must.> RAMEN SOLOI feel like a ramen Jedi because I used the force in my favor. This place is packed. I walked by on a Friday night and there were 40 people in line. I checked out the menu and I knew I had to eat here. It was now Saturday night and again there were 40 people in line at 6:30pm. It didn't help that it was January and it was a high of 68, in fact it probably made the line even longer. The best part of traveling for work is dining solo and sometimes it has its advantages. While I was in the back of the line the server was looking for just one person and I was the lucky solo that literally got to skip the line. Honestly I was only in line for about 5 minutes. This was my lucky day to Ramen. The menu is not very friendly on line and it's inconsistent because there locations can have different items. They have a great $15 deal where you pick 3 items. I decided to go for it. I wanted to go spicy and decided to order the spicy miso ramen, Cha-Shu Gohan which is Pork and Rice and Aji Tama which is a soft boiled egg marinated in soy-based sauce. The egg was cooked perfectly. The broth for the ramen was crazy good. The menu says the broth takes 18 hours to make from beef bones. The Cha-Shu Gohan was really good. I added spicy broth to it and took it back to my hotel for breakfast. I'm a lucky man. The restaurant is tiny. It literally has 18 seats located at 2 tables and 1 bar that faces the kitchen. I was seated at a table of complete strangers. I honestly felt like I was traveling around the world by sharing a community table. Those people finished and I was introduced to a whole new group that joined me. Yes a party of 5 joined me at my table. As I enjoyed my ramen I listened to the girl next to me talk about her upcoming wedding. She shared the planing, the church, the dress and much more. I wanted to jump in but kept focusing on my ramen. The cutest part was when I went to leave she told me to have a nice night. That was really sweet considering we ate dinner together but never had a conversation with each other. I felt a little bad but it's best I kept quite because they would have never got me to stop talking. It is worth the wait. They really serve fast and keep the line moving. My waiter was really nice. I've read review that the servers are mean. I have to disagree with this. Hey have a job to do and that is to move people in and out. There was a group of four that had paid their bill and were still hanging out. The waiter politely asked them to leave. He did it in a nice manner but I'm sure someone in the group will write a bad review because the lu felt rushed. I could see that my waiter hates having to do this but it's the only way he can get diners in. My advice is to know what you want, eat your food, pay your bill and get out. It's your duty to help your fellow ramen lover waiting in line. I was lucky enough to have to force in my side and I hope you have the same luck that I did when you dine> This is a solid Ramen spot that will not disappoint. I stood in line with many others for ~40 min on a cold winter day, and would have happily done it again. There is nothing like sitting down with a piping hot bowl of Ramen on a cold day. I went with their signature Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, and paired it with their combo deal which is a total no-brainer. For only a few bucks extra the Ramen came with a rice bowl (Cha-Shu Gohan) and a soft boiled egg (Aji-Tama) on the side. I thought the broth of the Ramen was complex and oh so delicious. Personally, I thought the meat in the soup was too fatty which was a distraction from the otherwise great bowl of Ramen. The side dishes were flavorful and paired perfectly with my steaming hot bowl of soup. This restaurant is pretty small, so if you plan to head this way you better be prepared to wait. That being said, the chefs move quickly and all patrons have food in front of them pretty quickly which really helps the line outdoors to move along. Santouka's location in the Back Bay is a perfect place to take a pit-stop if you are doing some shopping on Newbury or at the Prudential. I'd happily recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good bowl of Ramen.",Null,4,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null

Aside from the volume, everything else is so amazing. The food is great, the service was great, and the bacon maple popcorn is amazing. It has a very cool vibe, the mix of people keeps it fun for everyone, and the music was just awesome. The only bad thing about the place that I can think of is that they had a different selection of spirits. Be prepared to try something new if you go here. There is no ""jack and coke"" or ""just a crown and coke"" at this place.> Unless your local and in the world of the service industry avoid this place - especially if your not from Boston - bartenders and to a certain degree the regulars seemed to have chips on their shoulders with something to prove  like ""we are from Boston and we work as service people and we only like our own kind"" type of attitude - I would avoid this place and go to Yvonnes around the corner if your looking for a good drink, vibe, and service.This spot may make you feel unsafe.  Bartenders may have been on some sort of testosterone supplement or something -> The burgers were AMAZING! Totally worth it. I got Curley's burger - super juicy and definitely filling. We also tried the popcorn appetizer (forgot what it was called!), but it had a distinct taste of bacon but it was definitely caramel-like flavored!Overall, 10/10 would most definitely come back for a delicious burger!> Something's different about jm Curley. Gone are the buzzing days of liquids lunches and hipster speed dating nights, replaced with slightly awkward afternoons in a ghost quiet dining room, buying brunch burgers at nearly twice the price from four years ago.Menu's unchanged (save replacing ""er"" with ""ah"" in an oddly supplicant plea to tourists?) so the senses will still be intrigued. Execution has fallen off a bit - the burger (at one time, one of Boston's best)was cool throughout and missing the Pop's Sauce. Rectified and washed down with a $10 Lone Wolf.And did I mention it was near silent?Definitely a more subdued, less patronized jm Curley than time and a comfortable skin would typically yield. Far FAR from unenjoyable; that said, I'm exploring other options when in the area.> I am a sucker for fried pickles, so I stopped by Jm Curley for a late lunch and loved it. I had fried pickles and a veggie burger with a side salad, which was all really delicious. They also have a variety of beers to choose from. The service was great, and the location is conveniently close to the T. Would definitely recommend checking out Jm Curley!",Null,3.5,Null,Null,Null,Yes,Null
